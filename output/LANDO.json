Gladstone Land's farms are predominantly located in regions where its tenants are able to grow fresh produce annual row crops, such as berries and vegetables, which are generally planted and harvested annually. The Company also owns farms growing permanent crops, such as almonds, apples, cherries, figs, lemons, olives, pistachios, and other orchards, as well as blueberry groves and vineyards, which are generally planted every 20-plus years and harvested annually. Approximately 30% of the Company's fresh produce acreage is either organic or in transition to become organic, and nearly 20% of its permanent crop acreage falls into this category. The Company may also acquire property related to farming, such as cooling facilities, processing buildings, packaging facilities, and distribution centers. Gladstone Land pays monthly distributions to its stockholders and has paid 141 consecutive monthly cash distributions on its common stock since its initial public offering in January 2013. The Company has increased its common distributions 35 times over the prior 39 quarters, and the current per-share distribution on its common stock is $0.0467 per month, or $0.5604 per year.

A description of funds from operations (\"FFO\"), core FFO (\"CFFO\"), adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\"), and net asset value (\"NAV\"), all non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) financial measures, appear at the end of this press release. All per-share references are to fully-diluted, weighted-average shares of common stock, unless noted otherwise. For further detail, please refer to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the \"Form 10-Q\"), which is available on the Investors section of the Company's website at [_www.GladstoneLand.com_](https://pr.report/41wj).\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Activity:**\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * **Lease Activity:** Executed 21 amended or new lease agreements during the quarter as follows:\n\n      * On annual row crop farms, we renewed or amended eight different leases that are expected to result in an aggregate increase in annual net operating income of approximately $309,000, or 11%, over that of the prior leases.\n\n      * On permanent crop farms, we renewed or amended 13 different leases. With four of these leases, we changed the lease structure whereby we eliminated the base rent, and in some cases, provided the tenants with a cash allowance, in exchange for significantly increasing the participation rent component in these leases, the majority of which will be recognized in the second half of 2025. The remaining nine leases are expected to result in an aggregate decrease in annual net operating income of approximately $441,000, or 15%, from that of the prior leases.\n\n    * **Vacant, Direct-operated, and Non-accrual Properties:** During all or a portion of the quarter, we had 20 farms (5 in California, 13 in Michigan, 1 in Oregon, and 1 in Washington) that were either vacant, direct-operated (via management agreements with unrelated third parties), or on which lease revenues were recognized on a cash basis. The year-over-year impact on our operations (Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023) as a result of these properties was a decrease in net operating income of approximately $638,000.\n\n    * **California Water Activity:** Purchased 2,260 gross acre-feet (over 736 million gallons) of water at a cost of approximately $883,000, or approximately $391 per gross acre-foot.\n\n  * **Debt Activity-Loan Repayments:** Repaid approximately $13.3 million of loans that were scheduled to either mature or reprice.\n\n  * **Equity Activity:**\n\n    * **Series E Preferred Stock:** Sold 3,595 shares of our 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series E Preferred Stock\") for net proceeds of approximately $81,000.\n\n    * **Repurchase Program:** Repurchased a total of 176,045 shares of our 6.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\") and our 6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series C Preferred Stock\") at an average repurchase price of $21.22 per share for a total gain on repurchase of approximately $231,000.\n\n  * **Increased and Paid Distributions:** Increased the distribution run rate on our common stock by 0.21% and paid monthly cash distributions totaling $0.1401 per share of common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results:**\n\nNet income for the quarter was approximately $6,000, compared to net income of approximately $3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Net loss to common stockholders during the quarter was approximately $5.8 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a net loss to common stockholders of approximately $3.0 million, or $0.08 per share, in the prior-year quarter. AFFO for the quarter was approximately $4.5 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to approximately $5.4 million, or $0.15 per share, in the prior-year quarter. Common stock dividends declared were $0.14 per share for both periods.\n\nTotal cash lease revenues decreased, driven by lower fixed base cash rents on certain properties, partially offset by additional participation rents recorded during the current quarter. Fixed base cash rents decreased by approximately $2.6 million, primarily due to the sale of a large farm in Florida during the first quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in revenue from certain vacant, direct-operated and non-accrual properties. Fixed base cash rents also decreased primarily due to the execution of certain lease agreements in 2024, pursuant to which we agreed to reduce the fixed base rent amounts and, in some cases, provided certain tenants with cash lease incentives in exchange for increasing the participation rent components in the leases, the majority of which will be recognized in the second half of 2025. Participation rents increased by approximately $1.1 million due to additional information related to prior years' harvest becoming available in the current quarter to allow us to estimate certain amounts. Based on the participation rents recorded thus far, the increase was primarily driven by stronger production (i.e., pounds per acre) on certain pistachio farms, partly due to the alternate-bearing nature of such tree crops.\n\nAggregate related-party fees decreased by approximately $800,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by an incentive fee earned by our investment adviser in the prior-year quarter. Excluding related-party fees, our recurring core operating expenses increased by approximately $666,000 due to higher property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses incurred in the current-year quarter. The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by higher costs incurred on properties that were either vacant, direct-operated, or on non-accrual status at some point during the quarter, including additional real estate taxes, third-party property management expenses, and legal fees associated with leasing and rent collection efforts. General and administrative costs increased primarily due to additional stockholder-related expenses incurred and higher professional fees.\n\nCash flows from operations for the current quarter decreased by approximately $1.4 million from the prior-year quarter, largely due to the payment of certain cash allowances provided for in three leases that were executed in the current quarter and an increase in cash payments made towards the acquisition of water assets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash receipts attributable to participation rents. Our estimated NAV per share decreased by $4.76 from the prior-year quarter to $15.57 at September 30, 2024, primarily due to valuation decreases in certain of our farms that were re-appraised over the past year and an increase in the fair value of our fixed, long-term borrowings and certain preferred securities (driven by changes in market interest rates and conditions).\n\n**Subsequent to September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * **Disposition Activity:** In October 2024, we entered into agreements to sell 11 blueberry farms located in Allegan and Van Buren, Michigan, for total consideration of approximately $5.0 million, exclusive of closing costs. We currently expect these sales to be completed during the three months ending December 31, 2024.\n\n  * **Equity Activity:**\n\n    * **Common Stock-ATM Program:** Issued and sold 346,216 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $4.6 million under our \"at-the-market\" program (the \"ATM Program\").\n\n  * **Fourth Quarter Distributions:** Declared monthly cash distributions of $0.0467 per share of common stock for each of October, November, and December.\n\n\n\n\n**Comments from David Gladstone, President and CEO of Gladstone Land:** \"Our annual row crop farms, including both those in California and Florida, continue to perform, both in terms of value appreciation and rent growth. The market for many permanent crop farms in the west has been negatively impacted by lower crop prices, higher input costs, and water uncertainty. As such, we've decided to take a different approach with the leases on a few of these farms, whereby we will grant the tenants a cash allowance to cover a portion of their costs in return for receiving a larger portion of the gross crop proceeds on the farms. While we intend for this to be a temporary structure, we believe this arrangement is the most profitable structure for this specific set of farms due to the history of high yields on these farms, which allows for strong crop insurance, and we continue to see prices of these crops trending upwards. Regarding the continuing tenancy issues on certain of our farms, we currently have six properties (encompassing 7 of our 168 farms) that are either vacant or being direct-operated via agreements with third-party management groups, and we have portions of four properties (encompassing 11 farms) that are held for sale. We expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter, and we also continue to be in discussions with various groups to either lease or buy certain other farms in our portfolio. We hope to have these remaining issues resolved by the end of the year, and such solutions may include listing certain farms at auction if not leased or sold beforehand. In the meantime, we continue to acquire more water at below-market prices, providing additional water security to our farms and those growers who lease them. Our balance sheet remains strong, with nearly 100% of our borrowings at fixed rates, and we continue to maintain high levels of liquidity and overall access to capital.\"\n\n**Quarterly Summary Information****(Dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts)**\n\n**For and As of the Quarters Ended** | **Change** | **Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**9/30/2024** | **9/30/2023** | **($/#)** | **(%)**  \n**Operating Data:**  \nTotal operating revenues | $ | 22,571 | $ | 23,534 | $ | (963 | ) | (4.1 | )%  \nTotal operating expenses | (15,699 | ) | (14,136 | ) | (1,563 | ) | 11.1 | %  \nOther (expenses), net | (6,866 | ) | (6,257 | ) | (609 | ) | 9.7 | %  \n**Net income** | **$** | **6** | **$** | **3,141** | **$** | **(3,135** | **)** | **(99.8** | **)%**  \nLess: Aggregate dividends declared on and gain (loss) recognized on extinguishment of cumulative redeemable preferred stock, net(1) | (5,793 | ) | (6,105 | ) | 312 | (5.1 | ) %  \n**Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders** | **(5,787** | **)** | **(2,964** | **)** | **(2,823** | **)** | **95.2** | **%**  \nPlus: Real estate and intangible depreciation and amortization | 8,805 | 9,244 | (439 | ) | (4.7 | )%  \nPlus: Losses on dispositions of real estate assets, net | 832 | 4 | 828 | 20,700.0 | %  \nPlus: Impairment charges | 2,106 | -

Gladstone Land's farms are predominantly located in regions where its tenants are able to grow fresh produce annual row crops, such as berries and vegetables, which are generally planted and harvested annually. The Company also owns farms growing permanent crops, such as almonds, apples, cherries, figs, lemons, olives, pistachios, and other orchards, as well as blueberry groves and vineyards, which are generally planted every 20-plus years and harvested annually. Approximately 30% of the Company's fresh produce acreage is either organic or in transition to become organic, and nearly 20% of its permanent crop acreage falls into this category. The Company may also acquire property related to farming, such as cooling facilities, processing buildings, packaging facilities, and distribution centers.

FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company believes that FFO per share provides investors with an additional context for evaluating its financial performance and as a supplemental measure to compare it to other REITs; however, comparisons of its FFO to the FFO of other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to potential differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such other REITs.\n\n**CFFO:** CFFO is FFO, adjusted for items that are not indicative of the results provided by the Company's operating portfolio and affect the comparability of the Company's period-over-period performance. These items include certain non-recurring items, such as acquisition- and disposition-related expenses, the net incremental impact of operations conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiary, income tax provisions, and property and casualty losses or recoveries. Although the Company's calculation of CFFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs, the Company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its sustainable operating performance. Accordingly, CFFO should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. For a full explanation of the adjustments made to arrive at CFFO, please read the Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC.\n\n**AFFO:** AFFO is CFFO, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the straight-lining of rents and amortizations into or against rental income (resulting in cash rent being recognized ratably over the period in which the cash rent is earned). Although the Company's calculation of AFFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs, the Company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its sustainable operating performance on a cash basis. Accordingly, AFFO should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. For a full explanation of the adjustments made to arrive at AFFO, please read the Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC.\n\nA reconciliation of FFO (as defined by NAREIT), CFFO, and AFFO (each as defined above) to net income (loss), which the Company believes is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure for each, and a computation of fully-diluted net income (loss), FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per weighted-average share is set forth in the Quarterly Summary Information table above. The Company's presentation of FFO, CFFO, or AFFO, does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.\n\n**NAV:** Pursuant to a valuation policy approved by our board of directors, our valuation team, with oversight from the chief valuation officer, provides recommendations of value for our properties to our board of directors, who then review and approve the fair values of our properties. Per our valuation policy, our valuations are derived based on either the purchase price of the property; values as determined by independent, third-party appraisers; or through an internal valuation process, which process is, in turn, based on values as determined by independent, third-party appraisers. In any case, we intend to have each property valued by an independent, third-party appraiser at least once every three years, or more frequently in some instances. Various methodologies are used, both by the appraisers and in our internal valuations, to determine the fair value of our real estate, including the sales comparison, income capitalization (or a discounted cash flow analysis), and cost approaches of valuation. NAV is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial position of an equity REIT and is calculated as total equity available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders, adjusted for the increase or decrease in fair value of our real estate assets and encumbrances relative to their respective cost bases. Further, we calculate NAV per share by dividing NAV by our total shares outstanding (inclusive of both our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling third parties). A reconciliation of NAV to total equity, to which the Company believes is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per-share amount):\n\n**Total equity per balance sheet** | **$** | **691,204**  \n---|---|---  \n_Fair value adjustment for long-term assets:_  \nLess: net cost basis of real estate holdings and related assets(1) | $ | (1,273,579 | )  \nPlus: estimated fair value of real estate holdings(2) | 1,462,362  \nNet fair value adjustment for real estate holdings | 188,783  \n_Fair value adjustment for long-term liabilities:_  \nPlus: book value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3) | 593,435  \nLess: fair value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3)(4) | (559,136 | )  \nNet fair value adjustment for long-term indebtedness | 34,299  \n**Estimated NAV** | **914,286**  \nLess: aggregate fair value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock(5) | (356,302 | )  \n**Estimated NAV available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders** | **$** | **557,984**  \nTotal common shares and non-controlling OP Units outstanding | 35,838,442  \n**Estimated NAV per common share and non-controlling OP Unit** | **$** | **15.57**  \n(1) | Consists of the initial acquisition price (including the costs allocated to both tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed), plus subsequent improvements and other capitalized costs associated with the properties, and adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization.  \n---|---  \n(2) | As determined by the Company's valuation policy and approved by its board of directors.  \n(3) | Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of notes and bonds payable) and the Series D Term Preferred Stock.  \n(4) | Long-term notes and bonds payable were valued using a discounted cash flow model. The Series D Term Preferred Stock was valued based on its closing stock price as of September 30, 2024.  \n(5) | The Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were each valued based on their respective closing stock prices as of September 30, 2024, while the Series E Preferred Stock was valued at its liquidation value.  \n  \nComparison of our estimated NAV and estimated NAV per share to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the calculation or application of the definition of NAV used by such REITs. In addition, the trading price of our common shares may differ significantly from our most recent estimated NAV per share calculation. The Company's independent auditors have neither audited nor reviewed our calculation of NAV or NAV per share. For a full explanation of our valuation policy, please read the Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC.\n\n_CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:_\n\n_Certain statements in this press release, including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to maintain or grow its portfolio and FFO, expected increases in capitalization rates, benefits from increases in farmland values, increases in operating revenues, and the increase in NAV per share, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

A description of funds from operations (\"FFO\"), core FFO (\"CFFO\"), adjusted FFO (\"AFFO\"), and net asset value (\"NAV\"), all non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles in the United States) financial measures, appear at the end of this press release. All per-share references are to fully-diluted, weighted-average shares of common stock, unless noted otherwise. For further detail, please refer to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the \"Form 10-Q\"), which is available on the Investors section of the Company's website at [_www.GladstoneLand.com_](https://pr.report/41wj).\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Activity:**\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * **Lease Activity:** Executed 21 amended or new lease agreements during the quarter as follows:\n\n      * On annual row crop farms, we renewed or amended eight different leases that are expected to result in an aggregate increase in annual net operating income of approximately $309,000, or 11%, over that of the prior leases.\n\n      * On permanent crop farms, we renewed or amended 13 different leases. With four of these leases, we changed the lease structure whereby we eliminated the base rent, and in some cases, provided the tenants with a cash allowance, in exchange for significantly increasing the participation rent component in these leases, the majority of which will be recognized in the second half of 2025. The remaining nine leases are expected to result in an aggregate decrease in annual net operating income of approximately $441,000, or 15%, from that of the prior leases.\n\n    * **Vacant, Direct-operated, and Non-accrual Properties:** During all or a portion of the quarter, we had 20 farms (5 in California, 13 in Michigan, 1 in Oregon, and 1 in Washington) that were either vacant, direct-operated (via management agreements with unrelated third parties), or on which lease revenues were recognized on a cash basis. The year-over-year impact on our operations (Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023) as a result of these properties was a decrease in net operating income of approximately $638,000.\n\n    * **California Water Activity:** Purchased 2,260 gross acre-feet (over 736 million gallons) of water at a cost of approximately $883,000, or approximately $391 per gross acre-foot.\n\n  * **Debt Activity-Loan Repayments:** Repaid approximately $13.3 million of loans that were scheduled to either mature or reprice.\n\n  * **Equity Activity:**\n\n    * **Series E Preferred Stock:** Sold 3,595 shares of our 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series E Preferred Stock\") for net proceeds of approximately $81,000.\n\n    * **Repurchase Program:** Repurchased a total of 176,045 shares of our 6.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series B Preferred Stock\") and our 6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the \"Series C Preferred Stock\") at an average repurchase price of $21.22 per share for a total gain on repurchase of approximately $231,000.\n\n  * **Increased and Paid Distributions:** Increased the distribution run rate on our common stock by 0.21% and paid monthly cash distributions totaling $0.1401 per share of common stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results:**\n\nNet income for the quarter was approximately $6,000, compared to net income of approximately $3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Net loss to common stockholders during the quarter was approximately $5.8 million, or $0.16 per share, compared to a net loss to common stockholders of approximately $3.0 million, or $0.08 per share, in the prior-year quarter. AFFO for the quarter was approximately $4.5 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to approximately $5.4 million, or $0.15 per share, in the prior-year quarter. Common stock dividends declared were $0.14 per share for both periods.\n\nTotal cash lease revenues decreased, driven by lower fixed base cash rents on certain properties, partially offset by additional participation rents recorded during the current quarter. Fixed base cash rents decreased by approximately $2.6 million, primarily due to the sale of a large farm in Florida during the first quarter of 2024, as well as a decrease in revenue from certain vacant, direct-operated and non-accrual properties. Fixed base cash rents also decreased primarily due to the execution of certain lease agreements in 2024, pursuant to which we agreed to reduce the fixed base rent amounts and, in some cases, provided certain tenants with cash lease incentives in exchange for increasing the participation rent components in the leases, the majority of which will be recognized in the second half of 2025. Participation rents increased by approximately $1.1 million due to additional information related to prior years' harvest becoming available in the current quarter to allow us to estimate certain amounts. Based on the participation rents recorded thus far, the increase was primarily driven by stronger production (i.e., pounds per acre) on certain pistachio farms, partly due to the alternate-bearing nature of such tree crops.\n\nAggregate related-party fees decreased by approximately $800,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by an incentive fee earned by our investment adviser in the prior-year quarter. Excluding related-party fees, our recurring core operating expenses increased by approximately $666,000 due to higher property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses incurred in the current-year quarter. The increase in property operating expenses was primarily driven by higher costs incurred on properties that were either vacant, direct-operated, or on non-accrual status at some point during the quarter, including additional real estate taxes, third-party property management expenses, and legal fees associated with leasing and rent collection efforts. General and administrative costs increased primarily due to additional stockholder-related expenses incurred and higher professional fees.\n\nCash flows from operations for the current quarter decreased by approximately $1.4 million from the prior-year quarter, largely due to the payment of certain cash allowances provided for in three leases that were executed in the current quarter and an increase in cash payments made towards the acquisition of water assets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash receipts attributable to participation rents. Our estimated NAV per share decreased by $4.76 from the prior-year quarter to $15.57 at September 30, 2024, primarily due to valuation decreases in certain of our farms that were re-appraised over the past year and an increase in the fair value of our fixed, long-term borrowings and certain preferred securities (driven by changes in market interest rates and conditions).\n\n**Subsequent to September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * **Portfolio Activity:**\n\n    * **Disposition Activity:** In October 2024, we entered into agreements to sell 11 blueberry farms located in Allegan and Van Buren, Michigan, for total consideration of approximately $5.0 million, exclusive of closing costs. We currently expect these sales to be completed during the three months ending December 31, 2024.\n\n  * **Equity Activity:**\n\n    * **Common Stock-ATM Program:** Issued and sold 346,216 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $4.6 million under our \"at-the-market\" program (the \"ATM Program\").\n\n  * **Fourth Quarter Distributions:** Declared monthly cash distributions of $0.0467 per share of common stock for each of October, November, and December.\n\n\n\n\n**Comments from David Gladstone, President and CEO of Gladstone Land:** \"Our annual row crop farms, including both those in California and Florida, continue to perform, both in terms of value appreciation and rent growth. The market for many permanent crop farms in the west has been negatively impacted by lower crop prices, higher input costs, and water uncertainty. As such, we've decided to take a different approach with the leases on a few of these farms, whereby we will grant the tenants a cash allowance to cover a portion of their costs in return for receiving a larger portion of the gross crop proceeds on the farms. While we intend for this to be a temporary structure, we believe this arrangement is the most profitable structure for this specific set of farms due to the history of high yields on these farms, which allows for strong crop insurance, and we continue to see prices of these crops trending upwards. Regarding the continuing tenancy issues on certain of our farms, we currently have six properties (encompassing 7 of our 168 farms) that are either vacant or being direct-operated via agreements with third-party management groups, and we have portions of four properties (encompassing 11 farms) that are held for sale. We expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter, and we also continue to be in discussions with various groups to either lease or buy certain other farms in our portfolio. We hope to have these remaining issues resolved by the end of the year, and such solutions may include listing certain farms at auction if not leased or sold beforehand. In the meantime, we continue to acquire more water at below-market prices, providing additional water security to our farms and those growers who lease them. Our balance sheet remains strong, with nearly 100% of our borrowings at fixed rates, and we continue to maintain high levels of liquidity and overall access to capital.\"\n\n**Quarterly Summary Information****(Dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts)**\n\n**For and As of the Quarters Ended** | **Change** | **Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**9/30/2024** | **9/30/2023** | **($/#)** | **(%)**  \n**Operating Data:**  \nTotal operating revenues | $ | 22,571 | $ | 23,534 | $ | (963 | ) | (4.1 | )%  \nTotal operating expenses | (15,699 | ) | (14,136 | ) | (1,563 | ) | 11.1 | %  \nOther (expenses), net | (6,866 | ) | (6,257 | ) | (609 | ) | 9.7 | %  \n**Net income** | **$** | **6** | **$** | **3,141** | **$** | **(3,135** | **)** | **(99.8** | **)%**  \nLess: Aggregate dividends declared on and gain (loss) recognized on extinguishment of cumulative redeemable preferred stock, net(1) | (5,793 | ) | (6,105 | ) | 312 | (5.1 | ) %  \n**Net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders** | **(5,787** | **)** | **(2,964** | **)** | **(2,823** | **)** | **95.2** | **%**  \nPlus: Real estate and intangible depreciation and amortization | 8,805 | 9,244 | (439 | ) | (4.7 | )%  \nPlus: Losses on dispositions of real estate assets, net | 832 | 4 | 828 | 20,700.0 | %  \nPlus: Impairment charges | 2,106 | -

During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we adjusted our definition of AFFO to exclude from this adjustment the removal of lease incentives that were a result of previous cash disbursements made by us to or on behalf of our tenants.

Gladstone Land's farms are predominantly located in regions where its tenants are able to grow fresh produce annual row crops, such as berries and vegetables, which are generally planted and harvested annually. The Company also owns farms growing permanent crops, such as almonds, apples, cherries, figs, lemons, olives, pistachios, and other orchards, as well as blueberry groves and vineyards, which are generally planted every 20-plus years and harvested annually. Approximately 30% of the Company's fresh produce acreage is either organic or in transition to become organic, and nearly 20% of its permanent crop acreage falls into this category. The Company may also acquire property related to farming, such as cooling facilities, processing buildings, packaging facilities, and distribution centers. Gladstone Land pays monthly distributions to its stockholders and has paid 141 consecutive monthly cash distributions on its common stock since its initial public offering in January 2013. The Company has increased its common distributions 35 times over the prior 39 quarters, and the current per-share distribution on its common stock is $0.0467 per month, or $0.5604 per year. Additional information, including detailed information about each of the Company's farms, can be found at [_www.GladstoneLand.com_](https://pr.report/41wz).\n\nOwners or brokers who have farmland for sale in the U.S. should contact:\n\n  * Western U.S. - Bill Reiman at (805) 263-4778 or _Bill.R@GladstoneLand.com_;\n\n  * Midwestern U.S. and Mid-Atlantic U.S. - Joey Van Wingerden at (703) 287-5914 or _Joe.V@GladstoneLand.com_; or\n\n  * Southeastern U.S. - Brett Smith at (904) 687-5284 or _Brett.S@GladstoneLand.com_ _._\n\n\n\n\nLenders who are interested in providing us with long-term financing on farmland should contact Jay Beckhorn at (703) 587-5823 or _Jay.Beckhorn@Gladstone.com_.\n\nFor stockholder information on Gladstone Land, call (703) 287-5893.

FFO, as defined by NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company believes that FFO per share provides investors with an additional context for evaluating its financial performance and as a supplemental measure to compare it to other REITs; however, comparisons of its FFO to the FFO of other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to potential differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such other REITs.\n\n**CFFO:** CFFO is FFO, adjusted for items that are not indicative of the results provided by the Company's operating portfolio and affect the comparability of the Company's period-over-period performance. These items include certain non-recurring items, such as acquisition- and disposition-related expenses, the net incremental impact of operations conducted through our taxable REIT subsidiary, income tax provisions, and property and casualty losses or recoveries. Although the Company's calculation of CFFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs, the Company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its sustainable operating performance. Accordingly, CFFO should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. For a full explanation of the adjustments made to arrive at CFFO, please read the Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC.\n\n**AFFO:** AFFO is CFFO, adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as the straight-lining of rents and amortizations into or against rental income (resulting in cash rent being recognized ratably over the period in which the cash rent is earned). Although the Company's calculation of AFFO differs from NAREIT's definition of FFO and may not be comparable to that of other REITs, the Company believes it is a meaningful supplemental measure of its sustainable operating performance on a cash basis. Accordingly, AFFO should be considered a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance. For a full explanation of the adjustments made to arrive at AFFO, please read the Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC.\n\nA reconciliation of FFO (as defined by NAREIT), CFFO, and AFFO (each as defined above) to net income (loss), which the Company believes is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure for each, and a computation of fully-diluted net income (loss), FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per weighted-average share is set forth in the Quarterly Summary Information table above. The Company's presentation of FFO, CFFO, or AFFO, does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of its performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions.\n\n**NAV:** Pursuant to a valuation policy approved by our board of directors, our valuation team, with oversight from the chief valuation officer, provides recommendations of value for our properties to our board of directors, who then review and approve the fair values of our properties. Per our valuation policy, our valuations are derived based on either the purchase price of the property; values as determined by independent, third-party appraisers; or through an internal valuation process, which process is, in turn, based on values as determined by independent, third-party appraisers. In any case, we intend to have each property valued by an independent, third-party appraiser at least once every three years, or more frequently in some instances. Various methodologies are used, both by the appraisers and in our internal valuations, to determine the fair value of our real estate, including the sales comparison, income capitalization (or a discounted cash flow analysis), and cost approaches of valuation. NAV is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial position of an equity REIT and is calculated as total equity available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders, adjusted for the increase or decrease in fair value of our real estate assets and encumbrances relative to their respective cost bases. Further, we calculate NAV per share by dividing NAV by our total shares outstanding (inclusive of both our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling third parties). A reconciliation of NAV to total equity, to which the Company believes is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per-share amount):\n\n**Total equity per balance sheet** | **$** | **691,204**  \n---|---|---  \n_Fair value adjustment for long-term assets:_  \nLess: net cost basis of real estate holdings and related assets(1) | $ | (1,273,579 | )  \nPlus: estimated fair value of real estate holdings(2) | 1,462,362  \nNet fair value adjustment for real estate holdings | 188,783  \n_Fair value adjustment for long-term liabilities:_  \nPlus: book value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3) | 593,435  \nLess: fair value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3)(4) | (559,136 | )  \nNet fair value adjustment for long-term indebtedness | 34,299  \n**Estimated NAV** | **914,286**  \nLess: aggregate fair value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock(5) | (356,302 | )  \n**Estimated NAV available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders** | **$** | **557,984**  \nTotal common shares and non-controlling OP Units outstanding | 35,838,442  \n**Estimated NAV per common share and non-controlling OP Unit** | **$** | **15.57**  \n(1) | Consists of the initial acquisition price (including the costs allocated to both tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed), plus subsequent improvements and other capitalized costs associated with the properties, and adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization.  \n---|---  \n(2) | As determined by the Company's valuation policy and approved by its board of directors.  \n(3) | Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of notes and bonds payable) and the Series D Term Preferred Stock.  \n(4) | Long-term notes and bonds payable were valued using a discounted cash flow model. The Series D Term Preferred Stock was valued based on its closing stock price as of September 30, 2024.  \n(5) | The Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were each valued based on their respective closing stock prices as of September 30, 2024, while the Series E Preferred Stock was valued at its liquidation value.  \n  \nComparison of our estimated NAV and estimated NAV per share to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the calculation or application of the definition of NAV used by such REITs. In addition, the trading price of our common shares may differ significantly from our most recent estimated NAV per share calculation. The Company's independent auditors have neither audited nor reviewed our calculation of NAV or NAV per share. For a full explanation of our valuation policy, please read the Form 10-Q, filed today with the SEC.\n\n_CAUTION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:_\n\n_Certain statements in this press release, including, but not limited to, the Company's ability to maintain or grow its portfolio and FFO, expected increases in capitalization rates, benefits from increases in farmland values, increases in operating revenues, and the increase in NAV per share, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION\nBusiness and Organization\nGladstone Land Corporation (“we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is an agricultural real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that was re-incorporated in Maryland on March 24, 2011,\nhaving been originally incorporated in California on June 14, 1997. We are primarily in the business of owning and leasing farmland, and we conduct substantially all of our\noperations through a subsidiary, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership. As we currently control the sole general\npartner of the Operating Partnership and own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”), the\nfinancial position and results of operations of the Operating Partnership are consolidated within our financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the\nCompany owned 100.0% of the outstanding OP Units (see Note 8, “Equity,” for additional discussion regarding OP Units).\nGladstone Land Advisers, Inc. (“Land Advisers”), a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of ours, was created to collect any non-qualifying income related to our real estate\nportfolio and to perform certain small-scale farming business operations. We have elected for Land Advisers to be taxed as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) of ours. Since we\ncurrently own 100% of the voting securities of Land Advisers, its financial position and results of operations are consolidated within our financial statements. For the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, and for the tax year ended December 31, 2023, there was no taxable income or loss from Land Advisers, nor did we have any undistributed\nREIT taxable income.\nSubject to certain restrictions and limitations, and pursuant to contractual agreements, our business is managed by Gladstone Management Corporation (the “Adviser”), a\nDelaware corporation, and administrative services are provided to us by Gladstone Administration, LLC (the “Administrator”), a Delaware limited liability company. Our\nAdviser and Administrator are both affiliates of ours (see Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions,” for additional discussion regarding our Adviser and Administrator).\nAll further references herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer, collectively, to Gladstone Land Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where\nindicated otherwise.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nInterim Financial Information\nOur interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and pursuant to the\nrequirements for reporting on Form 10-Q in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, certain disclosures accompanying annual financial statements prepared\nin accordance with GAAP are omitted. The interim financial statements and accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nnotes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on\nFebruary 20, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”). The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may\nbe expected for other interim periods or for the full fiscal year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting\nperiods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form\nthe basis for making certain judgments. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nRecently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting—Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosures. The ASU expands public entities’ segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of\nsignificant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. It also\nrequires disclosure of the amount and description of the composition of other segment items, as well as interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets.\nThe ASU also applies to entities with a single\n8\nTable of Contents\nreportable segment. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 3. REAL ESTATE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAll of our properties are wholly-owned on a fee-simple basis, except where noted.

Total accretion related to below-market lease values was\napproximately $203,000 and $392,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately $42,000 and $131,000 for\n10\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Total net accretion (amortization) related to lease incentives and other deferred revenue, net was\napproximately $456,000 and $(201,000) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately$ (36,000) and $(73,000) for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nAcquisitions\nWe did not acquire any new farms during either of the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nProperty Sale\nOn January 11, 2024, we completed the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Martin County, Florida, for approximately $65.7 million. Including closing costs, we recognized a net gain\non the sale of approximately $10.4 million.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nIn connection with the acquisition of certain farmland located in Fresno County, California, we also acquired an ownership in a related limited liability company (the “Fresno\nLLC”), the sole purpose of which is to own and maintain a pipeline conveying water to our and other neighboring properties. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of\ncertain farmland located in Umatilla County, Oregon, we also acquired an ownership in a related limited liability company (the “Umatilla LLC”), the sole purpose of which is to\nown and maintain an irrigation system providing water to our and other neighboring properties.\nAs of September 30, 2024, our aggregate ownership interest in the Fresno LLC and the Umatilla LLC was5 0.0% and 20.5%, respectively. As our investments in the Fresno\nLLC and Umatilla LLC are both deemed to constitute “significant influence,” we have accounted for these investments under the equity method.\nWe recorded an aggregate gain (loss) of approximately $28,000 and $(143,000) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and an aggregate\nloss of approximately $24,000 and $84,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively (included in Gain (loss) from investments in\nunconsolidated entities on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income), which represents our pro-rata share of the aggregate loss\nrecognized by the Fresno LLC and the Umatilla LLC. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our combined ownership interest in the Fresno LLC and the Umatilla\nLLC had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $5.6 million and $5.8 million, respectively, and is included within Other assets, net on the accompanying Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments in Water Assets\nSemitropic Water Storage District Banked Water\nIn connection with the acquisition of certain farmland located in Kern County, California, in 2021, we also acquiredt hree contracts to purchase an aggregate of 45,000 acre-feet\nof banked water held by Semitropic Water Storage District (“SWSD”), a water storage district located in Kern County, California. Subsequently in 2021, we executed all three\ncontracts to purchase all 45,000 acre-feet of banked water for an aggregate additional cost of approximately $2.8 million.\nIn addition, since the initial acquisition, additional contracts to purchase banked water held by SWSD were conveyed to us by one of our tenants as partial consideration for rent\npayments owed. The following table summarizes the total acre-feet of banked water obtained through exercising these contracts as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nAcre-feet of Banked Water Total Carrying Value of\nAvailable to Purchase per Acre-feet of Banked Water Value Attributed Cost to Exercise Banked Water\nPeriod Acquired Contract Purchased(1) to Contract(2) Contract Purchased\nThree months ended December 31, 2023 1,003 1,003 $ 401 $ 61 $ 463\nThree months ended March 31, 2024 2,306 2,306 923 141 1,064\nTotal 3,309 3,309 $ 1,324 $ 202 $ 1,527\n(1) All contracts to purchase additional banked water were exercised in the same quarter in which the respective contract was conveyed to us.\n(2) Represents noncash income received during the respective periods. The straight-line impact of these receipts is included within Lease revenue, net on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements\nof Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nAll banked water acquired was recognized at cost, including the subsequent cost to execute the contracts and any administrative fees necessary to transfer the water to our\nbanked water account. As of September 30, 2024, the 48,309 acre-feet of banked water held by SWSD was recognized as a long-term water asset and had an aggregate carrying\nvalue of approximately $35.5 million (included within Other assets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets).\nWestlands Water District Groundwater Credits\n11\nIn addition, from May 2023 through March 2024, we elected to participate in a groundwater recharge program established by Westlands Water District (“WWD”), a water\ndistrict located in Fresno County, California. Under the program, WWD paid for surplus surface water to be delivered to individual landowners’ properties with district-\napproved groundwater recharge facilities, also known as “water banks.” The landowner was allowed to keep 50% of the net amount of groundwater credits generated under the\nprogram (after allowing for certain leave-behind and evaporative losses), and the remaining 50% was used to recharge the aquifer and retained by WWD. Delivery of water\nunder this program was subject to surplus water availability at WWD’s discretion. WWD terminated the program for the 2024 water year effective March 5, 2024. Through\nSeptember 30, 2024, we have recognized 2,660 acre-feet of water credits, which represents 50% of the total net water credits generated and confirmed by WWD under the\nprogram as of such date. As of September 30, 2024, these water credits were recognized as a long-term water asset and had an aggregate carrying value of approximately\n$753,000 (included within Other assets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets). In addition, as a result of being granted these water credits in exchange for\ntransferring and storing this surplus water on behalf of WWD, we recognized approximately $0 and $453,000 of non-cash revenue during the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, respectively, which represents the estimated fair value of the water credits obtained during the period. No such revenue was recorded during either of the\nprior-year periods.\nOther Groundwater Credits\nDuring 2023 and 2024, we also entered into various other agreements with certain third parties (including local water districts and private individuals) to either buy water\ndirectly, buy a portion of other water districts’ surface water allocations in future years in which allocations are granted, or to store surface water on others’ behalf in one of our\ngroundwater recharge facilities in exchange for a portion of the net groundwater credits produced and recognized by the respective water district. Through September 30, 2024,\nwe have obtained 2,819 acre-feet of water credits as a result of these agreements, which were recognized as a long-term water asset with an aggregate carrying value of\napproximately $535,000 (included within Other assets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets).\nTotal Long-term Water Assets\nAs of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we owned a total of 53,787 acre-feet and 46,400 acre-feet, respectively, of long-term water assets, and our investments in\nthese assets had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $36.8 million and $34.6 million, respectively, and are included within Other assets, net on our Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe have invested approximately $1.4 million to construct groundwater recharge facilities on two of our farms, which is included within Real estate, at cost on our Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, through September 30, 2024, we have invested an additional $3.3 million in the aggregate in connection with these agreements that\nare expected to result in additional groundwater credits in the future; however, the amount and timing of these credits, if any, is currently unknown and is dependent upon and\nsubject to the recognition of such credits by the respective water districts, in their sole discretion. Such costs are held in a deferred asset account (also included within Other\nassets, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets) until the related net water credits become estimable and are recognized by the respective water district, at which\ntime the costs would be reclassed to investments in long-term water assets.\nPortfolio Concentrations\nCredit Risk\nAs of September 30, 2024, our farms were leased to various different, unrelated third-party tenants, with certain tenants leasing more than one farm. No individual tenant\nrepresented greater than 10% of the total lease revenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nGeographic Risk\nFarms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $43.3 million (68.1%) and $9.1 million (14.3%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024. We seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible. If an unexpected natural disaster (such as\nan earthquake, wildfire, flood, or hurricane) occurs or climate change impacts the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial performance and ability to continue operations. To date, none of our farms have been materially impacted by natural disasters. See “—California Floods” and “—\nSoutheastern U.S. Hurricanes” below for a discussion on damage caused on certain of our farms by the January 2023 floods that occurred in California and by the hurricanes\nthat occurred in the Southeastern U.S. in September and October 2024. Besides California and Florida, no other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of the total lease\nrevenue recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n12\nCalifornia Floods\nIn January 2023, periods of heavy rainfall in California resulted in floods that impacted several areas of the state, including regions where certain of our farms are located. As a\nresult of the flooding, one of our farms in the Central Valley suffered damage to certain structures located on the farm, and we estimated the carrying value of such structures to\nbe approximately $855,000. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we wrote down the carrying value of these structures and also recorded a corresponding\nproperty and casualty loss, included within Property and casualty loss, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Certain of our\nother farms in California suffered minor damage as a result of the floods, but no other farms were materially impacted.\nIn addition, in February 2024, certain parts of California, particularly the southern part of the state, experienced a “one-in-one-thousand year” rainfall event, as atmospheric\nriver storms caused widespread flooding and mudslides in multiple areas. Certain of our farms suffered minor damage as a result of the storms, but no farms were materially\nimpacted.\nSoutheastern U.S. Hurricanes\nIn September and October 2024, Hurricanes Helene and Milton caused widespread destruction across many states in the Southeastern U.S., including areas where several of our\nfarms are located.\nAs a result of Hurricane Helene in September 2024, one of our farms in Georgia suffered damage to certain permanent plantings on the farm, and we estimated the carrying\nvalue of such plantings to be approximately $275,000. As such, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we wrote down the carrying value of these plantings and\nalso recorded a corresponding property and casualty loss, included within Property and casualty loss, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and\nComprehensive Income. Certain of our other farms in the region suffered minor damage as a result of Hurricane Helene, but no other farms were materially impacted.\nAs a result of Hurricane Milton in October 2024, a portion of a cooling facility located on one of our farms in Florida suffered minor water damage. We are unable to estimate\nthe extent of the damage at this time; however, we do not expect the cost of repairs to be material, and we expect the damage to be fully covered by insurance. We are still\nassessing the overall impact of Hurricane Milton. While planting may be slightly delayed, we do not expect any material impact to our farms or our tenants’ operations as a\nresult of Hurricane Milton.\nImpairment\nWe evaluate our entire portfolio each quarter for any impairment indicators and perform an impairment analysis on those select properties and water assets that have an\nindication of impairment. If this analysis indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in earnings equal to the amount by which the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, as a result of shortening our assumed holding periods for certain farms,\nwe recognized an aggregate impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million on portions of four properties (encompassing a total of 11 farms) located in Allegan and Van\nBuren, Michigan, due to the estimated fair values being lower than the respective carrying values. Our estimates of fair value were determined based on expected sales prices per\ncertain agreements entered into subsequent to September 30, 2024 (see Note 11, “Subsequent Events—Portfolio Activity—Dispositions,” for further discussion on the potential\nsale of these farm). We did not record any impairment charges during 2023.\nNOTE 4. BORROWINGS\nOur borrowings as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, are summarized below (dollars in thousands):\n13\nCarrying Value as of As of September 30, 2024\nStated Interest\nRates(1) Maturity Dates\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (Range; Wtd Avg) (Range; Wtd Avg)\nVariable-rate revolving lines of credit $ 200 $ 200 7.33% 12/15/2033\nNotes and bonds payable:\nFixed-rate notes payable $ 500,096 $ 524,199 2.45%-6.97%; 3.71% 2/14/2025 - 7/1/2051; June 2033\n7/24/2025 - 12/30/2030; Jan\nFixed-rate bonds payable 32,964 52,640 3.13%–4.57%; 3.85%\n2028\nTotal notes and bonds payable 533,060 576,839\nDebt issuance costs – notes and bonds payable (2,582) (2,928) N/A N/A\nNotes and bonds payable, net $ 530,478 $ 573,911\nTotal borrowings, net $ 530,678 $ 574,111\n(1) Where applicable, stated interest rates are before interest patronage (as described below).\nAs of September 30, 2024, the above borrowings were collateralized by certain of our farms with an aggregate net book value of approximately $1.1 billion. The weighted-\naverage stated interest rate charged on the above borrowings (excluding the impact of debt issuance costs and before any interest patronage, or refunded interest) was 3.83% and\n3.82% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectfully, as compared to3 .81% and 3.79% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,\nrespectively. In addition, 2023 interest patronage from our Farm Credit Notes Payable (as defined below) resulted in a 22.0% reduction (approximately 101 basis points) to the\nstated interest rates on such borrowings. See below under “—Farm Credit Notes Payable—Interest Patronage” for further discussion on interest patronage.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants applicable to the above borrowings.\nMetLife Facility\nAs amended, our credit facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”) consists of $75.0 million of revolving equity lines of credit (the “MetLife Lines of\nCredit”), a $75.0 million long-term note payable (the “2020 MetLife Term Note”), and a $100.0 million long-term note payable (the “2022 MetLife Term Note,” and together\nwith the MetLife Lines of Credit and the 2020 MetLife Term Note, the “MetLife Facility”).\nThe following table summarizes the pertinent terms of the MetLife Facility as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands, except for footnotes):\nAggregate Maturity Principal Undrawn\nIssuance Commitment Dates Outstanding Interest Rate Terms Commitment(1)\nMetLife Lines of Credit $ 75,000 12/15/2033 $ 200 3M SOFR + 2.00% (2) $ 74,800\n2020 MetLife Term Note 75,000 (3) 1/5/2030 36,900 2.75%, fixed through 1/4/2030 (4) 38,100\n2022 MetLife Term Note 100,000 (3) 1/5/2032 — (4) 100,000\nTotals $ 250,000 $ 37,100 $ 212,900\n(1) Based on the properties that were pledged as collateral under the MetLife Facility, as of September 30, 2024, the maximum additional amount we could draw under the facility was approximately $110.2\nmillion.\n(2) The interest rate on the MetLife Lines of Credit is subject to a minimum annualized rate of 2.50%, plus an unused fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20% on undrawn amounts (based on the balance drawn under\neach line of credit).\n(3) If the aggregate commitments under the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the 2022 MetLife Term Note are not fully utilized by December 31, 2024, MetLife has no obligation to disburse the additional funds\nunder either note.\n(4) Interest rates on future disbursements under each of the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the 2022 MetLife Term Note will be based on prevailing market rates at the time of such disbursements. In addition,\nthrough December 31, 2024, the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the 2022 MetLife Term Note are each subject to an unused fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20% on undrawn amounts (based on the balance\ndrawn under the respective note).\nFarmer Mac Facility\nThrough certain subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, we have entered into a bond purchase agreement (the “Bond Purchase Agreement”) with Federal Agricultural\nMortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation (the “Bond Purchaser”) for a secured note purchase facility (the “Farmer Mac\nFacility”). As amended from time to time, the Farmer Mac Facility currently provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate amount of $225.0 million. Pursuant to the Bond\nPurchase Agreement, as further amended on June 2, 2023, we may issue new bonds under the Farmer Mac Facility through December 31, 2026, and the final maturity date for\nnew bonds issued under the facility will be the date that is ten years from the applicable issuance date. We did not issue any new bonds under the Farmer Mac Facility during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n14\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $33.0 million of bonds issued and outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nFarm Credit Notes Payable\nFrom time to time since September 2014, we, through certain subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, have entered into various loan agreements (collectively, the “Farm\nCredit Notes Payable”) with various different Farm Credit associations (collectively, “Farm Credit”). We did not enter into any new loan agreements with Farm Credit during\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nInterest Patronage\nInterest patronage, or refunded interest, on our borrowings from Farm Credit is generally recorded upon receipt and is included within Other income on our Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Receipt of interest patronage typically occurs in the first half of the calendar year following the calendar\nyear in which the respective interest expense is accrued.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded interest patronage of approximately $1.9 million related to interest accrued on the Farm Credit Notes Payable\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, and during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we received approximately $111,000 of interest patronage, as certain Farm\nCredit associations paid a portion of the 2023 interest patronage (which relates to interest accrued during 2023 but is typically paid during the first half of 2024) early. In total,\n2023 interest patronage resulted in a 22.0% reduction (approximately 101 basis points) to the interest rates on such borrowings. Interest patronage is paid at Farm Credit’s\ndiscretion, and we are therefore unable to estimate the amount of interest patronage to be received, if any, related to interest accrued during 2024 on our Farm Credit Notes\nPayable.\nDebt Service – Aggregate Maturities\nScheduled principal payments of our aggregate notes and bonds payable as of September 30, 2024, for the succeeding years are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nPeriod Scheduled Principal Payments\nFor the remaining three months ending December2 03214: $ 2,677\nFor the fiscal years ending Decembe2r 03215: 38,622\n2026 17,749\n2027 50,933\n2028 77,322\n2029 152,787\nThereafter 192,970\n$ 533,060\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repaid approximately $29.5 million of bonds that were scheduled to either mature or reprice. On a weighted-average\nbasis, these borrowings bore interest at a fixed, stated rate of 3.66% and an effective interest rate (after interest patronage, where applicable) of3 .23%.\nFair Value\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820)” (“ASC 820”), provides a definition of fair value that focuses on the exchange (exit)\nprice of an asset or liability in the principal, or most advantageous market, and prioritizes the use of market-based inputs to the valuation. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-level\nhierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as\nfollows:\n• Level 1 — inputs that are based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n• Level 2 — inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active or inactive markets or model-based valuation techniques, for which all significant\ninputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n• Level 3 — inputs are generally unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. These unobservable inputs are generally supported by little or no market\nactivity and are based upon management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the aggregate fair value of our notes and bonds payable was approximately $500.0 million, as compared to an aggregate carrying value (excluding\nunamortized related debt issuance costs) of approximately $533.1 million.\n15\nThe fair value of our notes and bonds payable is valued using Level 3 inputs under the hierarchy established by ASC 820-10 and is calculated based on a discounted cash flow\nanalysis, using discount rates based on management’s estimates of market interest rates on debt with comparable terms. Further, due to the revolving nature and variable interest\nrates applicable to the MetLife Lines of Credit, their aggregate fair value as of September 30, 2024, is deemed to approximate their aggregate carrying value of $200,000.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nIn order to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates, we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements in connection with certain of our mortgage financings. In\naccordance with these swap agreements, we will pay our counterparty a fixed interest rate on a quarterly basis and receive payments from our counterparty equal to the\nrespective stipulated floating rates. We have adopted the fair value measurement provision for these financial instruments, and the aggregate fair value of our interest rate swap\nagreements is recorded in Other assets, net or Other liabilities, net, as appropriate, on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, in the absence of\nobservable market data, we will estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps using estimates of certain data points, including estimated remaining life, counterparty credit\nrisk, current market yield, and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s fair value\nmeasurement guidance, we have made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting\nagreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, our interest rate swaps were valued using Level 2 inputs.\nIn addition, we have designated our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss\non the derivative is initially recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified\ninto interest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects. During the next 12 months, we estimate that an additional $1.6 million will be\nreclassified as a reduction to interest expense.\nWe had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk as ofS eptember 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023\n(dollars in thousands):\nPeriod Number of Instruments Aggregate Notional Amount\nAs of September 30, 2024 4 $ 68,338\nAs of December 31, 2023 4 70,229\nThe following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps as well as their classification on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as ofS eptember 30, 2024, and\nDecember 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nDerivative Asset (Liability) Fair Value\nDerivative Type Balance Sheet Location September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nInterest rate swaps Other assets, net $ 5,775 $ 7,366\nTotal $ 5,775 $ 7,366\nThe following table presents the amount of (loss) income recognized in comprehensive (loss) income within our condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September For the Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDerivative in cash flow hedging relationship:\nInterest rate swaps $ (2,565) $ 1,557 $ (1,591) $ 1,264\nTotal $ (2,565) $ 1,557 $ (1,591) $ 1,264\nCredit-risk-related Contingent Features\nWe have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if we default on any of our indebtedness, then we could also be declared in default\non our derivative obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any derivatives in a net liability position, nor have we posted any collateral related to these\nagreements.\nNOTE 5. CUMULATIVE TERM PREFERRED STOCK\nIn January 2021, we completed a public offering of 5.00% Series D Cumulative Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series D Term Preferred Stock”), at a\npublic offering price of $25.00 per share. As a result of this offering (including the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments),\nwe issued a total of\n16\n2,415,000 shares of the Series D Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering\nexpenses borne by us, of approximately $58.3 million. The Series D Term Preferred Stock is traded under the ticker symbol “LANDM” on Nasdaq.\nThe shares of the Series D Term Preferred Stock have a mandatory redemption date of January 31, 2026, and are not convertible into our common stock or any other securities.\nWe may redeem the shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nWe incurred approximately $2.1 million in total offering costs related to this issuance, which have been recorded net of the Series D Term Preferred Stock as presented on the\naccompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized over the mandatory redemption period as a component of interest expense on the accompanying\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Series D Term Preferred Stock is recorded as a liability on our accompanying Condensed\nConsolidated Balance Sheets in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,” which states that mandatorily-redeemable financial instruments should be\nclassified as liabilities. In addition, the related dividend payments are treated similarly to interest expense on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and Comprehensive Income.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our Series D Term Preferred Stock was approximately $59.2 million, as compared to the carrying value (exclusive of unamortized\noffering costs) of approximately $60.4 million. The fair value of our Series D Term Preferred Stock uses Level 1 inputs under the hierarchy established by ASC 820-10 and is\ncalculated based on the closing per-share price on September 30, 2024, of $24.50.\nFor information on the dividends declared by our Board of Directors and paid by us on the Series D Term Preferred Stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nsee Note 8, “Equity—Distributions.”\nNOTE 6. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nOur Adviser and Administrator\nWe are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Adviser and our Administrator, which collectively employ all of our personnel and pay their salaries,\nbenefits, and general expenses directly. Both our Adviser and Administrator are affiliates of ours, as their parent company is owned and controlled by David Gladstone, our\nchairman, chief executive officer, and president. In addition, two of our executive officers, Mr. Gladstone and Terry Brubaker (our chief operating officer), serve as directors\nand executive officers of each of our Adviser and Administrator. Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president, general\ncounsel, and secretary) is also executive vice president of administration of our Adviser.\nWe have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Adviser (the “Advisory Agreement”) and an administration agreement with our Administrator (the\n“Administration Agreement”). Both the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement were approved unanimously by our Board of Directors, including our\nindependent directors. A summary of the compensation terms for the Advisory Agreement and a summary of the Administration Agreement is below.\nAdvisory Agreement\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is compensated in the form of a base management fee and, each as applicable, an incentive fee, a capital gains fee, and a\ntermination fee. Our Adviser does not charge acquisition or disposition fees when we acquire or dispose of properties, as is common in other externally-managed REITs. Each of\nthe base management, incentive, capital gains, and termination fees is described below.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, a base management fee is paid quarterly and is calculated at an annual rate of0 .60% (0.15% per quarter) of the prior calendar quarter’s\n“Gross Tangible Real Estate,” defined as the gross cost of tangible real estate owned by us (including land and land improvements, permanent plantings, irrigation and drainage\nsystems, farm-related facilities, and other tangible site improvements), prior to any accumulated depreciation, and as shown on our balance sheet or the notes thereto for the\napplicable quarter.\nIncentive Fee\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, an incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears if the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO (defined below) for a particular quarter exceeds\na hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.0% annualized) of the prior calendar quarter’s Total Adjusted Common Equity.\n17\nFor purposes of this calculation, Pre-Incentive Fee FFO is defined in the Advisory Agreement as FFO (also as defined in the Advisory Agreement) accrued by the Company\nduring the current calendar quarter (prior to any incentive fee calculation for the current calendar quarter), less any dividends declared on preferred stock securities that are not\ntreated as a liability for GAAP purposes. In addition, Total Adjusted Common Equity is defined as common stockholders’ equity plus non-controlling common interests in the\nOperating Partnership, if any (each as reported on our balance sheet), adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses and certain other one-time events and non-cash items.\nOur Adviser receives: (i) no incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO does not exceed the hurdle rate; (ii)1 00% of the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO\nwith respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized); and\n(iii) 20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized).\nCapital Gains Fee\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, a capital gains-based incentive fee is calculated and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Advisory\nAgreement). The capital gains fee shall equal: (i) 15% of the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains minus the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses, minus (ii) any\naggregate capital gains fees paid in prior periods. For purposes of this calculation, realized capital gains and losses will be calculated as (x) the sales price of the property, minus\n(y) any costs to sell the property and the then-current gross value of the property (which includes the property’s original acquisition price plus any subsequent, non-reimbursed\ncapital improvements). At the end of each fiscal year, if this figure is negative, no capital gains fee shall be paid.\nTermination Fee\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, in the event of our termination of the agreement with our Adviser for any reason (with1 20 days’ prior written notice and the vote of at\nleast two-thirds of our independent directors), a termination fee would be payable to the Adviser equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and\nincentive fee earned by the Adviser during the 24-month period prior to such termination.\nAdministration Agreement\nPursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay for our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses incurred while performing its obligations to us, including, but not\nlimited to, rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our Administrator’s employees, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general\ncounsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president, general counsel, and secretary), and their respective staffs.\nAs approved by our Board of Directors, our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses is generally derived by multiplying our Administrator’s total expenses by the\napproximate percentage of time the Administrator’s employees perform services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our\nAdministrator under similar contractual agreements.\nGladstone Securities\nWe have entered into an agreement with Gladstone Securities, LLC (“Gladstone Securities”), for it to act as our non-exclusive agent to assist us with arranging financing for our\nproperties (the “Financing Arrangement Agreement”). Gladstone Securities is a privately-held broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and\nthe Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Gladstone Securities is an affiliate of ours, as its parent company is owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone, who also serves on\nthe board of managers of Gladstone Securities. In addition, Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary, serves in several capacities for Gladstone Securities, including as\nits chief legal officer, secretary, a member of its board of managers, and a managing principal.\nFinancing Arrangement Agreement\nWe pay Gladstone Securities a financing fee in connection with the services it provides to us for securing financing on our properties. Depending on the size of the financing\nobtained, the maximum amount of the financing fee, which will be payable upon closing of the respective financing, will range from 0.5% to 1.0% of the amount of financing\nobtained. The amount of the financing fee may be reduced or eliminated as determined by us and Gladstone Securities after taking into consideration various factors, including,\nbut not limited to, the involvement of any unrelated third-party brokers and general market conditions.\nWe did not pay any financing fees to Gladstone Securities during either of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Through September 30, 2024, the total\namount of financing fees paid to Gladstone Securities represented approximately 0.14% of the total financings secured since the Financing Arrangement Agreement has been in\nplace.\nDealer-Manager Agreement\n18\nWe have entered into a dealer-manager agreement with Gladstone Securities (the “Dealer-Manager Agreement”), pursuant to which Gladstone Securities serves as our exclusive\ndealer-manager in connection with the offering of our Series E Preferred Stock (as defined in Note 8, “Equity—Equity Issuances”).\nPursuant to the Dealer-Manager Agreement, Gladstone Securities provides certain sales, promotional, and marketing services to us in connection with the offering of the Series\nE Preferred Stock, and we generally paid or pay Gladstone Securities the following:\ni selling commissions of up to 7.0% of the gross proceeds from sales in the offering (the “Selling Commissions”), and\nii a dealer-manager fee of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from sales in the offering (the “Dealer-Manager Fees”).\nGladstone Securities may, in its sole discretion, remit all or a portion of the Selling Commissions and also reallow all or a portion of the Dealer-Manager Fees to participating\nbroker-dealers and wholesalers in support of the offerings. The terms of the Dealer-Manager Agreement were approved by our board of directors, including its independent\ndirectors.\nThe following table summarizes the total Selling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees paid to Gladstone Securities during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nSeries E Preferred Stock $ 9 $ 215 39 547\nTotal Selling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees $ 9 $ 215 $ 39 $ 547\nSelling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees paid to Gladstone Securities are netted against the gross proceeds received from sales of the respective securities and are\nincluded within Additional paid-in capital on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRelated-Party Fees\nThe following table summarizes related-party fees paid or accrued for and reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBase management fee(1)(2) $ 2,070 $ 2,150 $ 6,303 $ 6,447\nIncentive fee(1)(2) 109 789 109 789\nIncentive fee waiver(2) (109) — (109) —\nTotal fees to our Adviser $ 2,070 $ 2,939 $ 6,303 $ 7,236\nAdministration fee(1)(2) $ 683 $ 619 $ 1,839 $ 1,708\nSelling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees(1)(3) $ 9 $ 215 $ 39 $ 547\nTotal fees to Gladstone Securities $ 9 $ 215 $ 39 $ 547\n(1) Pursuant to the agreements with the respective related-party entities, as discussed above.\n(2) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(3) Included within Additional paid-in capital on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRelated-Party Fees Due\nAmounts due to related parties on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were as follows (dollars in\nthousands):\n19\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nBase management fee $ 2,070 $ 2,156\nIncentive fee 109 982\nIncentive fee waiver (109) —\nOther, net(1) 52 49\nTotal due to Adviser 2,122 3,187\nAdministration fee 683 546\nCumulative accrued but unpaid portion of prior Administration Fees(2) — 141\nTotal due to Administrator 683 687\nTotal due to related parties(3) $ 2,805 $ 3,874\n(1) Other amounts due to or from our Adviser primarily relate to miscellaneous general and administrative expenses either paid by our Adviser on our behalf or by us on our Adviser’s behalf.\n(2) Represents the cumulative accrued but unpaid portion of prior Administration fees that are scheduled to be paid during the three months ending September 30 of each year, which is the quarter following our\nAdministrator’s fiscal year end.\n(3) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in legal proceedings from time to time. We are not currently subject to any material known or threatened litigation.\nNOTE 8. EQUITY\nRegistration Statement\nOn March 6, 2020, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-236943) with the SEC (the “2020 Registration Statement”). The 2020\nRegistration Statement, which was declared effective by the SEC on April 1, 2020, permitted us to issue up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion in securities, consisting of common\nstock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depository shares, subscription rights, and units, including through separate, concurrent offerings of two or more of such\nsecurities. Under the 2020 Registration Statement, we issued a total of 10,254,072 shares of Series C Preferred Stock (defined below) for gross proceeds of approximately\n$253.9 million, 2,415,000 shares of Series D Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million, 77,841 shares of Series E Preferred Stock for gross\nproceeds of approximately $1.9 million, and 14,367,524 shares of common stock (including common stock issued to redeem OP Units) for gross proceeds of approximately\n$280.9 million.\nOn March 28, 2023, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-270901), with the SEC (the “2023 Registration Statement”) to\nreplace the 2020 Registration Statement. The 2023 Registration Statement, which was declared effective by the SEC on April 13, 2023, permits us to issue up to an aggregate of\n$1.5 billion in securities consisting of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depository shares, subscription rights, and units, including through separate,\nconcurrent offerings of two or more securities. Through September 30, 2024, we have issued a total of 175,335 shares of Series E Preferred Stock (defined below) for gross\nproceeds of approximately $4.4 million and 124,460 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $2.2 million under the 2023 Registration Statement. See Note\n11, “Subsequent Events,” for equity issuances completed subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nEquity Issuances\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nOn April 3, 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for a continuous public offering (the “Series C Offering”) of our6 .00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable\nPreferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). Under the Series C Offering, as amended, we were permitted us to sell up to 10,200,000 shares of\nour Series C Preferred Stock on a “reasonable best efforts” basis through Gladstone Securities at an offering price of $25.00 per share (the “Primary Series C Offering”) and up\nto 200,000 additional shares of our Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) at a price of $22.75 per share. The Primary Series C\nOffering terminated on December 31, 2022, with substantially all of the allotted 10,200,000 shares being sold resulting in total gross proceeds, exclusive of redemptions, of\napproximately $252.6 million and net proceeds, after deducting commissions, dealer-manager fees, and offering expenses payable by us, of approximately $230.5 million. The\nSeries C Preferred Stock DRIP was terminated effective March 22, 2023.\n20\nWe listed the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LANDP,” and trading commenced on June 8, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we issued1 4,069 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to the DRIP, and 48,913 shares of Series C Preferred\nStock were tendered for optional redemption, which we satisfied with an aggregate cash payment of approximately $1.2 million. We did not issue any shares of the Series C\nPreferred Stock pursuant to the DRIP during the three months ended September 30, 2023, nor were any shares of the Series C Preferred Stock tendered for optional redemption.\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn November 9, 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for a continuous public offering (the “Series E Offering”) of up to8 ,000,000 shares of our 5.00% Series\nE Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series E Preferred Stock”), on a “reasonable best efforts” basis through Gladstone Securities at an\noffering price of $25.00 per share. See Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Gladstone Securities—Dealer-Manager Agreement,” for a discussion of the commissions and fees\nto be paid to Gladstone Securities in connection with the Series E Offering.\nThe following table provides information on sales of our Series E Preferred Stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands,\nexcept per-share amounts):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumber of shares sold 3,595 87,672 15,735 223,081\nWeighted-average offering price per share $ 24.89 $ 24.96 $ 24.98 $ 24.95\nGross proceeds $ 89 $ 2,188 $ 393 $ 5,566\nNet proceeds(1) $ 81 $ 1,973 $ 354 $ 5,019\n(1) Net of Selling Commissions, Dealer-Manager Fees, and underwriting discounts.\nThe Series E Offering will terminate on the date (the “Series E Termination Date”) that is the earlier of (i) December 31, 2025 (unless terminated or extended by our Board of\nDirectors) and (ii) the date on which all 8,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock offered in the Series E Offering are sold. There is currently no public market for shares of\nSeries E Preferred Stock. We intend to apply to list the Series E Preferred Stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one calendar year of the Series E\nTermination Date; however, there can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such timeframe, or at all.\nSee Note 11, “Subsequent Events,” for equity issuances completed subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nCommon Stock\nAt-the-Market Program\nWe have entered into equity distribution agreements (commonly referred to as “at-the-market agreements”) with Virtu Americas LLC and Ladenburg & Co. Inc. (each a “Sales\nAgent”), that, as amended, currently permit us to issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price\nof up to $500.0 million (the “ATM Program”). We did not sell any shares of common stock under the ATM Program during either of the three or nine months ended September\n30, 2024. The following table provides information on shares of common stock sold under the ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\n(dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2023\nNumber of shares sold 58,360 788,045\nWeighted-average offering price per share $ 17.34 $ 19.34\nGross proceeds $ 1,012 $ 15,240\nNet proceeds(1) $ 1,002 $ 15,087\n(1) Net of underwriting commissions\nSee Note 11, “Subsequent Events,” for equity issuances completed subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nRepurchase Program\n21\nOn May 17, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our 6.00% Series B Cumulative\nRedeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and up to $35.0 million of our Series C Preferred Stock (collectively, the “Repurchase\nProgram”). The Board’s authorization of the Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of\nsecurities, and expires on May 17, 2025. Under the Repurchase Program, repurchases are intended to be implemented through open market transactions on U.S. exchanges\nand/or in privately-negotiated transactions facilitated by a third-party broker acting as agent for us in accordance with applicable securities laws. Any repurchases will be made\nduring applicable trading window periods or pursuant to applicable Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.\nThe following table summarizes repurchase activity under the Repurchase Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands, except\nper-share amounts):\nThree Months Ended Nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nSeries B Preferred Stock:\nNumber of shares repurchased 60,441 115,176\nGross repurchase price(1) $ 1,296 $ 2,429\nWeighted-average repurchase price per share $ 21.44 $ 21.09\nGain on repurchase(2) $ 49 $ 133\nSeries C Preferred Stock:\nNumber of shares repurchased 115,604 201,646\nGross repurchase price(1) $ 2,440 $ 4,201\nWeighted-average repurchase price per share $ 21.10 $ 20.83\nGain on repurchase(2) $ 182 $ 372\n(1) Inclusive of broker commissions.\n(2) The gain on the repurchase of cumulative redeemable preferred stock is included within Gain (loss) on extinguishment of cumulative redeemable preferred stock, net on our accompanying Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nNon-Controlling Interests in Operating Partnership\nWe consolidate our Operating Partnership, which is a majority-owned partnership. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we owned1 00.0% of the outstanding\nOP Units.\nOn or after 12 months after becoming a holder of OP Units, each limited partner, other than the Company, has the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the\npartnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such units in exchange for cash or, at the Company’s\noption, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis. The cash redemption per OP Unit would be based on the market price of our common stock at the time of\nredemption. A limited partner will not be entitled to exercise redemption rights if the delivery of common stock to the redeeming limited partner would breach restrictions on the\nownership of common stock imposed under our charter and other limitations thereof.\nRegardless of the rights described above, the Operating Partnership will not have an obligation to issue cash to a unitholder upon a redemption request if the Company elects to\nredeem the OP Units for shares of its common stock. When a non-controlling unitholder redeems OP Units and the Company elects to satisfy that redemption through the\nissuance of common stock, non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership is reduced, and stockholders’ equity is increased.\nThe Operating Partnership is required to make distributions on each OP Unit in the same amount as those paid on each share of the Company’s common stock, with the\ndistributions on the OP Units held by the Company being utilized to make distributions to the Company’s common stockholders.\nDistributions\nThe per-share distributions to preferred and common stockholders declared by our Board of Directors during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are\nreflected in the table below.\n22\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\nIssuance 2024 2023 2024 2023\nSeries B Preferred Stock $ 0.375 $ 0.375 $ 1.125 $ 1.125\nSeries C Preferred Stock 0.375 0.375 1.125 1.125\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock(1) 0.312501 0.312501 0.937503 0.937503\nSeries E Term Preferred Stock 0.312501 0.312501 0.937503 0.937503\nCommon Stock(2) 0.1401 0.1386 0.4194 0.4143\n(1) Dividends are treated similar to interest expense on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(2) The same amounts were paid as distributions on each OP Unit held by non-controlling OP Unitholders, if any, as of the applicable date of record.\nNOTE 9. LEASE REVENUES\nThe following table sets forth the components of our lease revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands, except for\nfootnotes):\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFixed lease payments(1) $ 18,913 $ 21,102 $ 58,578 $ 63,180\nVariable lease payments(2) 3,658 2,432 5,089 2,766\nLease revenue, net(3) $ 22,571 $ 23,534 $ 63,667 $ 65,946\n(1) Fixed lease payments include contractual rents under lease agreements with tenants recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms and includes the amortization of above-market lease\nvalues and lease incentives and the accretion of below-market lease values and other deferred revenue.\n(2) Variable lease payments primarily consist of participation rents, which are generally based on a percentage of the gross crop revenues earned on the farm, and reimbursements of certain property operating\nexpenses by tenants. Participation rents are generally recognized when all contingencies have been resolved and when actual results become known or estimable, enabling us to estimate and/or measure our\nshare of such gross revenues. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded participation rents of approximately $3.5 million and $4.6 million, respectively, reimbursements of\ncertain property operating expenses by tenants of approximately $142,000 and $453,000, respectively, and late fees of approximately $4,000 and $11,000, respectively. During the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2023, we recorded participation rents of approximately $2.4 million and $2.6 million, respectively, reimbursements of certain property operating expenses by tenants of approximately\n$47,000 and $140,000, respectively, and late fees of approximately $0 and $46,000, respectively.\n(3) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nNOTE 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, computed\nusing the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the respective periods. Earnings figures are presented net of non-controlling interests in the earnings\nper share calculations. The non-controlling limited partners’ outstanding OP Units (which may be redeemed for shares of common stock) have been excluded from the diluted\nper-share calculation, as there would be no effect on the amounts since the non-controlling OP Unitholders’ share of earnings would also be added back to net income or loss.\n(Dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts): Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (5,787) $ (2,964) $ (4,992) $ (5,557)\nWeighted average shares of common stock outstanding – basic and diluted 35,838,442 35,822,123 35,838,442 35,698,458\nLoss per common share – basic and diluted $ (0.16) $ (0.08) $ (0.14) $ (0.16)\nThere were no OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders during either of the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023.\nNOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nPortfolio Activity—Dispositions\n23\nSubsequent to September 30, 2024, we entered into agreements to sell1 1 blueberry farms located in Allegan and Van Buren, Michigan, for total consideration of approximately\n$5.0 million, exclusive of closing costs. As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate carrying value of these farms was approximately $5.0 million and was included in Total real\nestate, net on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Industry publications and third-party research, surveys, and studies generally indicate that their information has been obtained from sources believed to be\nreliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. We have not independently verified the information contained in such sources\nAll references to “we,” “our,” “us” and the “Company” in this Quarterly Report mean Gladstone Land Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where it is made\nclear that the term refers only to Gladstone Land Corporation.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are an externally-managed, agricultural real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is engaged in the business of owning and leasing farmland. We are not a grower of crops,\nnor do we typically farm the properties we own. We currently own 168 farms comprised of 111,836 acres located across 15 states in the U.S. and 53,787 acre-feet of water\nassets in California. We also own several farm-related facilities, such as cooling facilities, packinghouses, processing facilities, and various storage facilities.\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities through, and all of our properties are held, directly or indirectly, by, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the “Operating\nPartnership”). Gladstone Land Corporation controls the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and currently owns, directly or indirectly, 100.0% of the units of\nlimited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”). In addition, we have elected for Gladstone Land Advisers, Inc. (“Land Advisers”), a wholly-owned\nsubsidiary of ours, to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).\nGladstone Management Corporation (our “Adviser”) manages our real estate portfolio pursuant to an advisory agreement, and Gladstone Administration, LLC (our\n“Administrator”), provides administrative services to us pursuant to an administration agreement. Our Adviser and our Administrator collectively employ all of our personnel\nand directly pay their salaries, benefits, and general expenses.\nPortfolio Diversification\nOur farmland portfolio currently consists of 168 farms leased to 94 different, unrelated third-party tenants who grow over 60 different types of crops on our farmsO. ur\ninvestment focus is in farmland suitable for growing either fresh produce annual row crops (e.g., certain berries and vegetables) or certain permanent crops (e.g., almonds,\nblueberries, pistachios, and wine grapes), with an ancillary focus on farmland growing certain commodity crops (e.g., beans and corn).\nThe following table summarizes the different geographic locations (by state) of our farms owned as of and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars\nin thousands):\n25\nAs of and For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 As of and For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\n% of % of Total % of % of Total\nNo. of Total Total Lease Lease No. of Total Total Lease Lease\nState Farms Acres Acres Revenue Revenue Farms Acres Acres Revenue Revenue\nCalifornia(1) 63 34,844 31.2% $ 43,331 68.1% 63 34,844 30.1% $ 42,945 65.1%\nFlorida 25 18,720 16.7% 9,120 14.3% 26 22,468 19.4% 11,280 17.1%\nWashington 6 2,520 2.2% 3,205 5.0% 6 2,529 2.2% 3,494 5.3%\nColorado 12 32,773 29.3% 1,984 3.1% 12 32,773 28.3% 1,904 2.9%\nArizona 6 6,320 5.6% 1,706 2.7% 6 6,320 5.5% 1,695 2.6%\nOregon 6 898 0.8% 1,650 2.6% 6 898 0.8% 1,625 2.5%\nMichigan 23 1,892 1.7% 746 1.2% 23 1,892 1.6% 727 1.1%\nNebraska 9 7,782 7.0% 603 0.9% 9 7,782 6.7% 1,018 1.5%\nMaryland 6 987 0.9% 345 0.5% 6 987 0.9% 345 0.5%\nTexas 1 3,667 3.3% 344 0.5% 1 3,667 3.2% 337 0.5%\nSouth Carolina 3 597 0.5% 183 0.3% 3 597 0.5% 183 0.3%\nGeorgia 2 230 0.2% 168 0.3% 2 230 0.2% 168 0.3%\nNorth Carolina 2 310 0.3% 126 0.2% 2 310 0.3% 72 0.1%\nNew Jersey 3 116 0.1% 100 0.2% 3 116 0.1% 97 0.1%\nDelaware 1 180 0.2% 56 0.1% 1 180 0.2% 56 0.1%\nTOTALS 168 111,836 100.0% $ 63,667 100.0% 169 115,593 100.0% $ 65,946 100.0%\n(1) According to the California Chapter of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, there are eight distinct growing regions within California; our farms are spread across six of these\ngrowing regions.\nLeases\nGeneral\nMost of our leases are on a triple-net basis, an arrangement under which, in addition to rent, the tenant is required to pay the related taxes, insurance costs, maintenance, and\nother operating costs. Our leases generally have original terms ranging from 3 to 10 years for farms growing row crops and 7 to 15 years for farms growing permanent crops (in\neach case, often with options to extend the lease further). Rent is generally payable to us in advance on either an annual, semi-annual, or quarterly basis, with such rent typically\nsubject to periodic escalation clauses as set forth within the lease. Currently, 103 of our farms are leased on a pure, triple-net basis, 49 farms are leased on a partial-net basis\n(with us, as landlord, responsible for all or a portion of the related property taxes), 3 farms are leased on a single-net basis (with us, as landlord, responsible for the related\nproperty taxes, as well as certain maintenance, repairs, or insurance costs), 1 farm is direct-operated, 1 farm is vacant, and 11 farms are held for sale (see below under “Recent\nDevelopments—Portfolio Activity—Existing Properties—Disposition Activity” for further discussion). Additionally, 29 of our farms are leased under agreements that include a\nvariable rent component, called “participation rents,” that are based on the gross revenues earned on the respective farms (though such leases generally include a guarantee of a\nminimum amount of rental income).\nLease Expirations\nAgricultural leases are often shorter term in nature (relative to leases of other types of real estate assets), so in any given year, we may have multiple leases up for extension or\nrenewal. The following table summarizes the lease expirations by year for the farms owned and with leases in place as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nNumber of Expiring Lease Revenue for the % of Total\nExpiring Leased % of Total Nine Months Ended Lease\nYear Leases(1) Acreage Acreage September 30, 2024 Revenue\n2024 7 4,058 3.6% $ 2,050 3.2%\n2025 17 24,592 22.0% 14,539 22.8%\n2026 8 10,394 9.3% 3,197 5.0%\n2027 9 8,497 7.6% 7,177 11.3%\n2028 13 4,867 4.3% 3,324 5.2%\n2029 8 1,973 1.8% 2,241 3.5%\nThereafter 42 56,101 50.2% 30,477 47.9%\nOther(2) 10 30 —% 369 0.6%\nTerminated/expired leases — 1,324 1.2% 293 0.5%\nTotals 114 111,836 100.0% $ 63,667 100.0%\n26\n(1) Certain lease agreements encompass multiple farms.\n(2) Primarily consists of ancillary leases (e.g., renewable energy leases; oil, gas, and mineral leases; telecommunications leases; etc.) with varying expirations on certain of our farms.\nWe currently have nine agricultural leases scheduled to expire within the next six months. We are currently exploring a variety of options with certain of these properties,\nincluding negotiating lease terms with existing and prospective new tenants (potentially through an adjusted lease structure whereby we would decrease the fixed base rent\namounts in exchange for increasing the participation rent component), discussing sale options with prospective buyers, and considering operating the properties ourselves via\nthird-party management agreements. Regarding all vacancies and upcoming lease expirations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the existing leases or\nexecute new leases at rental rates favorable to us, if at all, or be able to find replacement tenants, if necessary.\nRecent Developments\nPortfolio Activity—Existing Properties\nDisposition Activity\nIn October 2024, we entered into agreements to sell 11 blueberry farms located in Allegan and Van Buren, Michigan, for total consideration of approximately $5.0 million,\nexclusive of closing costs. We currently expect these sales to be completed during the three months ending December 31, 2024.\nLeasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes certain leasing activity that has occurred on our existing properties since July 1, 2024, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands,\nexcept for footnotes):\nPRIOR LEASES NEW LEASES(1)\nTotal # of Leases Lease Total # of Leases Lease\nNumber Total Annualized with Structures Annualized Wtd.

See Note 3,\n“Real Estate and Intangible Assets—Intangible Assets and Liabilities,” within the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements and “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Operating\nCommitments and Obligations—Operating Obligations” below for additional information on these and other commitments.\n(2) Based on the minimum cash rental payments guaranteed under the applicable leases (presented on an annualized basis), as required under GAAP, and excludes contingent rental payments, such as\nparticipation rents. In executing certain lease renewals, particularly those on certain western permanent crop farms, we reduced or eliminated the base rent component in exchange for significantly\nincreasing the participation rent component, the results of which will not be known until the second half of 2025.\n(3) “NNN” refers to leases under triple-net lease arrangements, “NN” refers to leases under partial-net lease arrangements, and “N” refers to leases under single-net lease arrangements, in each case, as\ndescribed above under “Leases—General.”\nVacant, Direct-operated, and Non-accrual Properties\nDuring a portion of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had 20 farms (5 in California, 13 in Michigan, 1 in Oregon, and 1 in Washington) that were either vacant,\ndirect-operated (via management agreements with unrelated third parties), or on which lease revenues were recognized on a cash basis (due to credit issues with two tenants\nleading us to determine that the full collectability of the remaining rental payments under the respective leases was not deemed to be probable). During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we recorded lease revenue related to the aforementioned farms of approximately $778,000 (including no participation rents), as compared to approximately\n$2.1 million (including approximately $195,000 of participation rents) during the prior-year period.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we entered into lease agreements with a new tenant on two farms in Michigan, and subsequent to September 30, 2024, we\nentered into agreements to sell the remaining 11 farms in Michigan, which we anticipate closing during the three months ending December 31, 2024.\nCurrently, 1 farm (in Washington) is vacant, 1 farm (in Oregon) is direct-operated, 5 farms (in California) are on non-accrual status, and 11 farms (in Michigan) are held for\nsale. Regarding vacant and direct-operated farms, we are exploring both leasing and selling options, and we are in discussions with both potential tenants and potential buyers\nfor these farms. We currently expect to enter into lease or sale agreements within the next six months with respect to each of these farms; however, there can be no guarantee that\nwe will be able to reach lease or sale agreements with tenants or buyers at favorable terms, or at all. Regarding the properties currently on non-accrual status, we are continuing\nto work with each of the tenants and will seek to come to an agreement for the remaining rental payments, if possible. Such agreement, if one can be reached, may include\nplacing the tenant on a payment plan, deferring a portion of the rent owed to us, or agreeing to terminate the lease. In the event\n27\nof a termination, we estimate that we would be able to find new tenants to lease each of these properties to at market rental rates within 1 to 12 months.\nWater Asset Acquisitions\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we purchased a total of 2,260 gross acre-feet of water from Byron-Bethany Irrigation District (“BBID”), a multi-county\nwater district located in Contra Costa County, California, for the 2024 water year for a total purchase price (including commissions and other closing costs) of approximately\n$883,000, or approximately $391 per gross acre-foot. This water was purchased pursuant to a water transfer agreement we entered into with BBID in October 2023, whereby we\nmay elect to purchase up to 15,000 acre-feet of water per water year during years in which BBID has a surplus supply of water through February 28, 2031. This water is\nexpected to be recognized in our account with the local water district within the next six months, net of standard losses, as may be applicable.\nWe currently own a total of 53,787 acre-feet of long-term water assets, and our investments in these long-term water assets have an aggregate carrying value of approximately\n$36.8 million.\nSoutheastern U.S. Hurricanes\nIn September and October 2024, Hurricanes Helene and Milton caused widespread destruction across many states in the Southeastern U.S., including areas where several of our\nfarms are located.\nAs a result of Hurricane Helene in September 2024, one of our farms in Georgia suffered damage to certain permanent plantings on the farm, and we estimated the carrying\nvalue of such plantings to be approximately $275,000. As such, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we wrote down the carrying value of these plantings and\nalso recorded a corresponding property and casualty loss, included within Property and casualty loss, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and\nComprehensive Income. Certain of our other farms in the region suffered minor damage as a result of Hurricane Helene, but no other farms were materially impacted.\nAs a result of Hurricane Milton in October 2024, a portion of a cooling facility located on one of our farms in Florida suffered minor water damage. We are unable to estimate\nthe extent of the damage at this time; however, we do not expect the cost of repairs to be material, and we expect the damage to be fully covered by insurance. We are still\nassessing the overall impact of Hurricane Milton. While planting may be slightly delayed, we do not expect any material impact to our farms or our tenants’ operations as a\nresult of Hurricane Milton.\nFinancing Activity\nDebt Activity—Loan Repayments\nFrom July 1, 2024, through the date of this filing, we repaid approximately $13.3 million of loans that were scheduled to either mature or reprice. On a weighted-average basis,\nthese borrowings bore interest at a stated rate of 4.28% and an effective rate (after interest patronage, where applicable) of 3.33%.\nEquity Activity\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn November 9, 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for a continuous public offering (the “Series E\nOffering”) of up to 8,000,000 shares of our newly-designated 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series E Preferred\nStock”), on a “reasonable best efforts” basis through Gladstone Securities at an offering price of $25.00 per share. See Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Gladstone\nSecurities—Dealer-Manager Agreement,” for a discussion of the commissions and fees to be paid to Gladstone Securities in connection with the Series E Offering.\nThe following table summarizes the sales of our Series E Preferred Stock that occurred from July 1, 2024, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands):\nNumber of Weighted-average\nShares Sold Offering Price Per Share Gross Proceeds Net Proceeds(1)\n3,595 $ 24.89 $ 89 $ 81\n(1) Net of underwriting discounts, selling commissions, and dealer-manager fees borne by us. Aggregate selling commissions and dealer-manager fees paid to Gladstone Securities as a result of these sales was\napproximately $9,000.\n28\nThe Series E Offering will terminate on the date (the “Series E Termination Date”) that is the earlier of (i) December 31, 2025 (unless terminated or extended by our Board of\nDirectors), and (ii) the date on which all 8,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock offered in the Series E Offering are sold. There is currently no public market for shares of\nSeries E Preferred Stock. We intend to apply to list the Series E Preferred Stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one calendar year of the Series E\nTermination Date; however, there can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such timeframe, or at all.\nCommon Stock—At-the-Market Program\nOn May 12, 2020, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Virtu Americas, LLC, and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (each a “Sales Agent”), that, as subsequently\namended, permitted us to issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $260.0 million\n(the “ATM Program”). On April 13, 2023, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution agreements with the Sales Agents to allow us to sell shares of our\ncommon stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500.0 million.\nThe following table summarizes the activity under the ATM Program from July 1, 2024, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands):\nWeighted-average\nOffering Price\nNumber of Shares Sold Per Share Gross Proceeds Net Proceeds(1)\n346,216 $ 13.52 $ 4,680 $ 4,633\n(1) Net of underwriting commissions.\nRepurchase Program\nOn May 17, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our 6.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable\nPreferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and up to $35.0 million of our 6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value\n$0.01 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock” and, collectively, the “Repurchase Program”). The Board’s authorization of the Repurchase Program may be suspended or\ndiscontinued at any time, does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and expires on May 17, 2025. Under the Repurchase Program, repurchases are\nintended to be implemented through open market transactions on U.S. exchanges and/or in privately-negotiated transactions facilitated by a third-party broker acting as agent for\nus in accordance with applicable securities laws. Any repurchases will be made during applicable trading window periods or pursuant to applicable Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.\nThe following table summarizes repurchase activity under the Repurchase Program that occurred from July 1, 2024, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands, except\nper-share amounts):\nSeries B Preferred Stock:\nNumber of shares repurchased 60,441\nGross repurchase price(1) $ 1,296\nWeighted-average repurchase price per share $ 21.44\nGain on repurchase(2) $ 49\nSeries C Preferred Stock:\nNumber of shares repurchased 115,604\nGross repurchase price(1) $ 2,440\nWeighted-average repurchase price per share $ 21.10\nGain on repurchase(2) $ 182\n(1) Inclusive of broker commissions.\n(2) The gain on the repurchase of cumulative redeemable preferred stock is included within Gain (loss) on extinguishment of cumulative redeemable preferred stock on our accompanying Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nImpact of Inflation and Interest Rates\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index (“CPI”) grew at an annual rate of 2.4% through September 30, 2024, as overall inflation continued to\nease from the peak levels experienced in the summer of 2022, when it reached the highest rates seen in over 40 years. The increase in food prices has also slowed but has\ngenerally kept pace with the rate of inflation until the past few months, as the overall food segment increased at an annual rate of 2.3% through September 30, 2024. In addition,\naccording to the NCREIF Farmland Index, which, as of September 30, 2024, consisted of approximately $16.5 billion of farms across the U.S., the total return on U.S. farmland\n(including appreciation and income) was 2.6% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2024. Despite the slowdown of increased food prices in recent months, prices remain\nhigh, as the food segment has increased by 18.0% over the past three years, outpacing overall CPI of 14.9% over the\n29\nsame time period. Although our farm operators have experienced increases in input costs, we believe such increases will be somewhat mitigated to the extent that food price\nincreases continue to outpace or keep pace with the rate of inflation.\nAfter holding rates flat since July 2023, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years in September 2024, reducing its benchmark funds rate by 50 basis\npoints and marking what many believe to be the beginning of a new monetary easing policy. This rate cut came on the heels of data indicating a slowing U.S. economy,\nincluding cooling inflation and a weaker labor market. However, since the September meeting, U.S. Treasury yields have spiked amidst stronger-than-expected U.S.\nmacroeconomic data. Despite this, most still expect the Federal Reserve to continue cutting rates throughout the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, though the timing and extent\nof such rate cuts, if any, remains uncertain. As a result of this uncertainty, interest rates remain somewhat volatile. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury Note still remains well\nabove 4.0%, and, as a result, interest rates on long-term financing continue to be high, thus limiting our ability to finance new acquisitions on favorable terms.\nOver 99.9% of our borrowings are currently at fixed rates, and on a weighted-average basis, these rates are fixed at an effective interest rate of 3.40% for another 3.7 years. As\nsuch, with respect to our current borrowings, we have experienced minimal impact from the higher interest rates experienced over the past couple of years, and we believe we\nare well-protected against a prolonged period of elevated interest rates, which remains a possibility.\nOur Adviser and Administrator\nWe are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Adviser and our Administrator (both affiliates of ours), which collectively employ all of our\npersonnel and pay their salaries, benefits, and general expenses directly. The current investment advisory agreement with our Adviser (the “Advisory Agreement”) and the\ncurrent administration agreement with our Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”) were each approved unanimously by our board of directors, including, specifically,\nour independent directors.\nA summary of certain compensation terms within the Advisory Agreement and a summary of the Administration Agreement is below.\nAdvisory Agreement\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is compensated in the form of a base management fee and, each as applicable, an incentive fee, a capital gains fee, and a\ntermination fee. Our Adviser does not charge acquisition or disposition fees when we acquire or dispose of properties, as is common in other externally-managed REITs. The\nbase management and incentive fees are described below. For information on the capital gains and termination fees, refer to Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Our Adviser\nand Administrator—Advisory Agreement,” within the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, a base management fee is paid quarterly and is calculated at an annual rate of 0.60% (0.15% per quarter) of the prior calendar quarter’s\n“Gross Tangible Real Estate,” defined as the gross cost of tangible real estate owned by us (including land and land improvements, permanent plantings, irrigation and drainage\nsystems, farm-related facilities, and other tangible site improvements), prior to any accumulated depreciation, and as shown on our balance sheet or the notes thereto for the\napplicable quarter.\nIncentive Fee\nPursuant to the Advisory Agreement, an incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears if the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO for a particular quarter exceeded a hurdle rate\nof 1.75% (7.0% annualized) of the prior calendar quarter’s Total Adjusted Common Equity.\nFor purposes of this calculation, Pre-Incentive Fee FFO is defined in the Advisory Agreement as FFO (also as defined in the Advisory Agreement) accrued by the Company\nduring the current calendar quarter (prior to any incentive fee calculation for the current calendar quarter), less any dividends declared on preferred stock securities that were not\ntreated as a liability for GAAP purposes. In addition, Total Adjusted Common Equity is defined as common stockholders’ equity plus non-controlling common interests in our\nOperating Partnership, if any (each as reported on our balance sheet), adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses and certain other one-time events and non-cash items.\nOur Adviser would receive: (i) no incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO did not exceed the hurdle rate; (ii) 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee\nFFO with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeded the hurdle rate but was less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized); and\n(iii) 20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized).\nAdministration Agreement\n30\nPursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay for our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses incurred while performing its obligations to us, including, but not\nlimited to, rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our Administrator’s employees, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general\ncounsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president, general counsel, and secretary), and their respective staffs. Our allocable portion of the Administrator’s\nexpenses is generally derived by multiplying our Administrator’s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time the Administrator’s employees perform services for us in\nrelation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our Administrator under similar contractual agreements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make judgments that are\nsubjective in nature to make certain estimates and assumptions. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as\nto future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our\nconsolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the purposes of the following discussions on certain operating revenues and expenses with regard to the comparison between the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023:\n• Same-property basis represents farms owned as of June 30, 2023, which were not vacant or direct-operated at any point during either period presented and full\ncollectability of future rental payments under the respective leases was deemed probable during the entirety of both periods;\n• Properties acquired or disposed of are farms that were either acquired or disposed of at any point subsequent to June 30, 2023. From July 1, 2023, through September 30,\n2024, we did not acquire any new farms and had one farm disposition; and\n• Vacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties are:\n◦ Farms that were vacant (either wholly or partially) at any point during either period presented;\n◦ Farms that were direct-operated at any point during either period presented; and\n◦ Farms with leases where revenue was recognized on a cash basis during either period presented (rather than a straight-line basis) due to full collectability of future\nrental payments under the respective leases deemed not to be probable as a result of tenant credit issues.\nFrom July 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, we had 23 farms which were either vacant, direct-operated, or placed on non-accrual during all or a portion of either\nperiod.\nFor the purposes of the following discussions on certain operating revenues and expenses with regard to the comparison between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023:\n• Same-property basis represents farms owned as of December 31, 2022, which were not vacant or direct-operated at any point during either period presented and full\ncollectability of future rental payments under the respective leases was deemed probable during the entirety of both periods;\n• Properties acquired or disposed of are farms that were either acquired or disposed of at any point subsequent to December 31, 2022. From January 1, 2023, through\nSeptember 30, 2024, we did not acquire any new farms and had one farm disposition; and\n• Vacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties are:\n◦ Farms that were vacant (either wholly or partially) at any point during either period presented;\n◦ Farms that were direct-operated at any point during either period presented; and\n◦ Farms with leases where revenue was recognized on a cash basis during either period presented (rather than a straight-line basis) due to full collectability of future\nrental payments under the respective leases deemed not to be probable as a result of tenant credit issues.\nFrom January 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024, we had 25 farms which were either vacant, direct-operated, or placed on non-accrual during all or a portion of either\nperiod.\nA comparison of results of components comprising our operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is below (dollars in\nthousands):\n31\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nOperating revenues:\nLease revenues:\nFixed lease payments $ 18,913 $ 21,102 $ (2,189) (10.4)%\nVariable lease payments – participation rents 3,512 2,385 1,127 47.3%\nVariable lease payments – tenant reimbursements and other 146 47 99 210.6%\nTotal operating revenues 22,571 23,534 (963) (4.1)%\nOperating expenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 8,805 9,244 (439) (4.7)%\nProperty operating expenses 1,380 729 651 89.3%\nBase management and incentive fees, net of incentive fee waiver 2,070 2,939 (869) (29.6)%\nAdministration fee 683 619 64 10.3%\nGeneral and administrative expenses 655 605 50 8.3%\nImpairment charge 2,106 — 2,106 NM\nTotal operating expenses 15,699 14,136 1,563 11.1%\nOperating income $ 6,872 $ 9,398 $ (2,526) (26.9)%\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nOperating revenues:\nLease revenues:\nFixed lease payments $ 58,578 $ 63,180 $ (4,602) (7.3)%\nVariable lease payments – participation rents 4,625 2,580 2,045 79.3%\nVariable lease payments – tenant reimbursements and other 464 186 278 149.5%\nTotal lease revenues 63,667 65,946 (2,279) (3.5)%\nOther operating revenues 453 — 453 NM\nTotal operating revenues 64,120 65,946 (1,826) (2.8)%\nOperating expenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 26,407 27,407 (1,000) (3.6)%\nProperty operating expenses 3,476 2,744 732 26.7%\nBase management and incentive fees, net of incentive fee waiver 6,303 7,236 (933) (12.9)%\nAdministration fee 1,839 1,708 131 7.7%\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,992 2,181 (189) (8.7)%\nImpairment charge 2,106 — 2,106 NM\nTotal operating expenses 42,123 41,276 847 2.1%\nOperating income $ 21,997 $ 24,670 $ (2,673) (10.8)%\nNM = Not Meaningful\nOperating Revenues\nLease revenue\nThe following table provides a summary of our lease revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n32\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSame-property basis:\nFixed lease payments $ 18,767 $ 19,528 $ (761) (3.9)% $ 57,140 $ 57,514 $ (374) (0.7)%\nParticipation rents 3,512 1,510 2,002 132.6% 4,387 1,511 2,876 190.3%\nTotal – Same-property basis 22,279 21,038 1,241 5.9% 61,527 59,025 2,502 4.2%\nProperties acquired or disposed of:\nFixed lease payments — 732 (732) (100.0)% — 2,195 (2,195) (100.0)%\nTotal – Properties acquired or disposed of — 732 (732) (100.0)% — 2,195 (2,195) (100.0)%\nVacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties:\nFixed lease payments 146 842 (696) (82.7)% 1,438 3,471 (2,033) (58.6)%\nParticipation rents — 875 (875) (100.0)% 238 1,069 (831) (77.7)%\nTotal – Vacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual\nproperties 146 1,717 (1,571) (91.5)% 1,676 4,540 (2,864) (63.1)%\nTenant reimbursements and other(1) 146 47 99 210.6% 464 186 278 149.5%\nTotal Lease revenues $ 22,571 $ 23,534 $ (963) (4.1)% $ 63,667 $ 65,946 $ (2,279) (3.5)%\n(1) Tenant reimbursements generally represent tenant-reimbursed property operating expenses on certain of our farms, including property taxes, insurance premiums, and other property-related expenses.\nSimilar amounts are also recorded as property operating expenses during the respective periods.\nSame-property Basis – 2024 compared to 2023\nLease revenues from fixed lease payments decreased primarily due to the execution of certain lease agreements in 2024, pursuant to which we agreed to reduce the fixed base\nrent amounts in exchange for increasing the participation rent components in the leases, the majority of which will be realized in 2025. This decrease was partially offset by an\nincrease in fixed lease payments attributable to the accelerated recognition of certain deferred rent asset balances attributable to the shortening of the expected lease terms\nassociated with leases on three of our farms, additional rents earned on capital improvements completed on certain of our farms, and recent lease renewals.\nThe amount of lease revenues from participation rents is largely dependent upon when certain information is made available to allow us to determine such amounts to be\nreasonably estimable and thus recorded. Based on the participation rents recorded thus far, the increase was primarily driven by stronger production (i.e., pounds per acre) on\ncertain pistachio farms, partly due to the alternate-bearing nature of such tree crops.\nOther – 2024 compared to 2023\nLease revenue from properties acquired or disposed of decreased due to the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Florida on January 11, 2024.\nLease revenue from vacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties decreased primarily due to revenues from certain of our leases being recognized on a cash basis during a\nportion of the current-year periods (rather than a straight-line basis), due to full collectability of future rental payments under the respective leases deemed not to be probable as\na result of tenant credit issues. In addition, certain of our farms were either direct-operated (on a temporary basis via management agreements with unrelated third-parties) or\nvacant for portions of each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in lease revenue from vacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties was\npartially offset by cash collections (in part or in whole) from tenants occupying certain of these properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nThe fluctuations in tenant reimbursement revenue are primarily driven by payments made by certain tenants on our behalf (pursuant to the lease agreements) to unconsolidated\nentities of ours that convey water to the respective properties. As such, the timing of tenant reimbursement revenue fluctuates as payments are made by our tenants. Amounts\nrecorded during the current-year periods include increased reimbursements from certain tenants for costs to deliver water to their farms via a pipeline owned by an\nunconsolidated entity of ours.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue consists of non-lease revenue generated as a result of activities performed on certain of our properties. During the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, we recognized approximately $0 and $453,000, respectively, of non-cash revenue associated with the transfer and storing of surplus water on behalf of a\ngovernment municipality using a groundwater recharge facility constructed on one of our farms. See Note 3, “Real Estate and Intangible Assets—Investments in Water Assets,”\nwithin the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n33\nOperating Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily due to the disposition of certain assets, including the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Florida in the first quarter of 2024,\nand certain other assets reaching the end of their useful lives. This decrease was partially offset by additional depreciation expense associated with new capital improvements\nmade on certain of our farms.\nProperty operating expenses\nProperty operating expenses consist primarily of real estate taxes, repair and maintenance expenses, insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous operating expenses paid for\ncertain of our properties. The following table provides a summary of the property-operating expenses recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and\n2023 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSame-property basis $ 822 $ 586 $ 236 40.3% $ 2,037 $ 1,967 $ 70 3.6%\nProperties acquired or disposed of — 32 (32) (100.0)% 2 117 (115) (98.3)%\nVacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties 404 53 351 662.3% 955 501 454 90.6%\nTenant-reimbursed property operating expenses(1) 154 58 96 165.5% 482 159 323 203.1%\nTotal Property operating expenses $ 1,380 $ 729 $ 651 89.3% $ 3,476 $ 2,744 $ 732 26.7%\n(1) Represents certain operating expenses (property taxes, insurance premiums, and other property-related expenses) paid by us that, per the respective leases, are required to be reimbursed to us by the tenant.\nSimilar amounts are also recorded as lease revenue when earned in accordance with the lease.\nSame-property Basis – 2024 compared to 2023\nProperty operating expenses increased primarily due to additional property taxes paid by us on behalf of one of our tenants who terminated their lease during the three months\nended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this increase was partially offset by a decrease in legal fees and other costs incurred in connection\nwith protecting water rights on certain farms in California, as well as a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense incurred during the prior-year period as a result of minor\ndamage at certain farms caused by natural disasters.\nOther – 2024 compared to 2023\nProperty operating expenses on properties acquired or disposed of decreased due to the sale of one farm in Florida, as discussed elsewhere.\nProperty operating expenses attributable to vacant, direct-operated, or non-accrual properties increased primarily due to additional property management fees incurred on certain\nfarms that were direct-operated for a portion of the current year-periods (via management agreements with unrelated third-parties) and additional property taxes incurred on\nthose farms. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, this increase was also attributable to an increase in legal fees incurred in connection with rent collection or lease\ntermination efforts on certain farms that were direct-operated or on non-accrual status.\nThe fluctuations in tenant-reimbursed property operating expenses are primarily driven by miscellaneous property operating costs incurred by us in connection with our\nownership interests in certain unconsolidated entities, for which our tenants are contractually obligated to reimburse us under the terms of the respective leases. Such expenses\nwill fluctuate commensurate with the timing and amount of miscellaneous operating costs incurred by the underlying entities. Amounts recorded during the current-year periods\ninclude additional costs to deliver water to certain of our farms via a pipeline owned by an unconsolidated entity of ours, which costs were reimbursed to us by our tenants.\nRelated-Party Fees\nThe following table provides the calculations of the base management and incentive fees due to our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement and credits granted to us by\nour Adviser for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands; for further discussion on certain defined terms used below, refer to Note 6,\n“Related-Party Transactions,” within the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements):\n34\nQuarter Ended\nMarch 31 June 30 September 30 Year to Date\n2024 Fee Calculations:\nBase Management Fee:\nGross Tangible Real Estate(1)(2) $ 1,437,812 $ 1,384,228 $ 1,380,264\nQuarterly rate 0.150 % 0.150 % 0.150 %\nBase management fee(3) $ 2,157 $ 2,076 $ 2,070 $ 6,303\nIncentive Fee:\nTotal Adjusted Common Equity(1)(2) $ 344,128 $ 346,578 $ 334,913\nFirst hurdle quarterly rate 1.750 % 1.750 % 1.750 %\nFirst hurdle threshold $ 6,022 $ 6,065 $ 5,861\nSecond hurdle quarterly rate 2.1875 % 2.1875 % 2.1875 %\nSecond hurdle threshold $ 7,528 $ 7,581 $ 7,326\nPre-Incentive Fee FFO(1) $ 5,988 $ 4,974 $ 5,970\n100% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of first hurdle\nthreshold, up to second hurdle threshold $ — $ — $ 109\n20% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of second hurdle\nthreshold — — —\nTotal Incentive fee(3) $ — $ — $ 109 $ 109\nIncentive fee waiver3) — — (109) (109)\nIncentive fee, net $ — $ — $ — $ —\nTotal fees due to Adviser $ 2,157 $ 2,076 $ 2,070 $ 6,303\n2023 Fee Calculations:\nBase Management Fee:\nGross Tangible Real Estate(1)(2) $ 1,432,394 $ 1,431,761 $ 1,433,713\nQuarterly rate 0.150 % 0.150 % 0.150 %\nBase management fee(3) $ 2,149 $ 2,148 $ 2,150 $ 6,447\nIncentive Fee:\nTotal Adjusted Common Equity(1)(2) $ 358,689 $ 362,411 $ 360,339\nFirst hurdle quarterly rate 1.750 % 1.750 % 1.750 %\nFirst hurdle threshold $ 6,277 $ 6,342 $ 6,306\nSecond hurdle quarterly rate 2.1875 % 2.1875 % 2.1875 %\nSecond hurdle threshold $ 7,846 $ 7,928 $ 7,882\nPre-Incentive Fee FFO(1) $ 5,303 $ 4,400 $ 7,095\n100% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of first hurdle\nthreshold, up to second hurdle threshold $ — $ — $ 789\n20% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of second hurdle\nthreshold — — —\nTotal Incentive fee(3) $ — $ — $ 789 $ 789\nTotal fees due to Adviser $ 2,149 $ 2,148 $ 2,939 $ 7,236\n(1) As defined in the Advisory Agreement.\n(2) As of the end of the respective prior quarters.\n(3) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n35\nThe base management fee decreased due to the disposition of certain assets since December 31, 2022, largely driven by the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Florida in the first\nquarter of 2024.\nOur Adviser earned an incentive fee during each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 due to our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO (as defined in the Advisory\nAgreement) exceeding the required hurdle rate of the applicable equity base during the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. However, during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, our Adviser granted us a non-contractual, unconditional, and irrevocable waiver to be applied against the entire incentive fee earned in the third quarter of\n2024.\nThe administration fee paid to our Administrator increased primarily due to us using a higher overall share of our Administrator’s resources in relation to those used by other\nfunds and affiliated companies serviced by our Administrator.\nOther Operating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees, director fees, stockholder-related expenses, overhead insurance, acquisition-related costs for\ninvestments no longer being pursued, and other miscellaneous expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,\nprimarily due to additional expenses incurred in the prior year related to the listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq and acquisition-related costs for investments no\nlonger being pursued.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an aggregate impairment charge of approximately $2.1 million on portions of 4 properties (encompassing a\ntotal of 11 farms) located in Allegan and Van Buren, Michigan, due to the estimated fair values being lower than the respective carrying values.\nA comparison of results of other components contributing to net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 is below (dollars in thousands):\n36\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nOperating income $ 6,872 $ 9,398 $ (2,526) (26.9)%\nOther expense (income):\nOther income 370 382 (12) (3.1)%\nInterest expense (5,402) (5,856) 454 (7.8)%\nDividends declared on cumulative term preferred stock (755) (755) — —%\nLoss on dispositions of real estate assets, net (832) (4) (828) 20,700.0%\nProperty and casualty loss, net (275) — (275) NM\nGain (loss) from investments in unconsolidated entities 28 (24) 52 (216.7)%\nTotal other expense, net (6,866) (6,257) (609) 9.7%\nNet income 6 3,141 (3,135) (99.8)%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests — — — NM\nNet income attributable to the Company 6 3,141 (3,135) (99.8)%\nAggregate dividends declared on and gain (loss) recognized on extinguishment of\ncumulative redeemable preferred stock, net (5,793) (6,105) 312 (5.1)%\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (5,787) $ (2,964) $ (2,823) 95.2%\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nOperating income $ 21,997 $ 24,670 $ (2,673) (10.8)%\nOther expense (income):\nOther income 3,295 3,365 (70) (2.1)%\nInterest expense (16,492) (17,835) 1,343 (7.5)%\nDividends declared on cumulative term preferred stock (2,264) (2,264) — —%\nGain on dispositions of real estate assets, net 6,641 5,910 731 12.4%\nProperty and casualty loss, net (284) (1,016) 732 (72.0)%\nLoss from investments in unconsolidated entities (143) (84) (59) 70.2%\nTotal other expense, net (9,247) (11,924) 2,677 (22.5)%\nNet income 12,750 12,746 4 —%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests — — — NM\nNet income attributable to the Company 12,750 12,746 4 —%\nAggregate dividends declared on and gain (loss) recognized on extinguishment of\ncumulative redeemable preferred stock, net (17,742) (18,303) 561 (3.1)%\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (4,992) $ (5,557) $ 565 (10.2)%\nNM = Not Meaningful\nOther (Expense) Income\nOther income generally consists of interest patronage received from Farm Credit (as defined in Note 4, “Borrowings,” in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements) and interest earned on short-term investments. Other income decreased primarily due to less interest patronage received from Farm Credit (primarily due to\ndecreased borrowings from Farm Credit), partially offset by an increase in additional interest earned on short-term investments due to higher interest rates.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded approximately $1.9 million of interest patronage from Farm Credit related to interest accrued during 2023, as\ncompared to approximately $2.3 million of interest patronage recorded during the prior-year period that related to interest accrued during 2022. In addition, during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we received approximately $111,000 of interest patronage related to interest accrued during 2023, as certain Farm Credit associations paid a\nportion of 2023 interest patronage (which is typically paid during the first half of 2024) early. In total, 2023 interest patronage resulted in a 22.0% reduction (approximately 101\nbasis points) to the interest rate of such borrowings.\nInterest expense decreased, primarily due to a decrease in overall borrowings. The weighted-average principal balance of our aggregate borrowings (excluding our cumulative\nterm preferred stock) outstanding for the three and nine months ended\n37\nSeptember 30, 2024, was approximately $540.9 million and $550.6 million, respectively, as compared to approximately $589.5 million and $600.5 million for the respective\nprior-year periods. Excluding interest patronage received on certain of our Farm Credit borrowings and the impact of debt issuance costs, the weighted-average interest rate\ncharged on our aggregate borrowings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 3.83% and 3.82%, respectively, as compared to 3.81% and 3.79% for the\nrespective prior-year periods.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a net capital gain, driven by the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Martin County, Florida, for approximately\n$65.7 million, which after accounting for closing costs, resulted in a net gain of approximately $10.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a\nnet capital gain, driven by the sale of a 138-acre parcel of unfarmed land in Florida for $9.6 million, which, after accounting for closing costs, resulted in a net gain of\napproximately $6.4 million. The net losses recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to the removal of some permanent plantings and the\ndisposal of certain irrigation and other improvements on certain of our farms.\nThe net property and casualty loss relates to net expenses incurred and insurance recoveries received for certain improvements that were damaged due to natural disasters. The\nproperty and casualty loss recorded during three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to damage caused by Hurricane Helene to certain permanent\nplants on one of our farms in Georgia. The property and casualty loss recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the heavy rainfall that\noccurred in California in early 2023 and the resulting flooding, which damaged certain structures located on one of our farms in the Central Valley.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur current short- and long-term sources of funds include cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, borrowings (including the undrawn commitments available\nunder our credit facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”)), and issuances of additional equity securities. Our current available liquidity is approximately\n$164.4 million, consisting of approximately $19.8 million in cash on hand and, based on the current level of collateral pledged, approximately $144.6 million of availability\nunder our credit facility with MetLife (subject to compliance with covenants) and other undrawn lines of credit, notes, or bonds. In addition, we currently have certain\nproperties valued at a total of approximately $159.8 million that are unencumbered and eligible to be pledged as collateral.\nOver 99.9% of our borrowings are currently at fixed rates, and on a weighted-average basis, these rates are fixed at an effective interest rate of 3.40% for another 3.7 years. In\naddition, the weighted-average remaining term of our notes and bonds payable is approximately 8.2 years. As such, with respect to our current borrowings, we have experienced\nminimal impact from increased interest rates in recent years, and we believe we are well-protected against a prolonged high rate environment. We are in compliance with all of\nour debt covenants under our respective credit facilities and borrowings, and we believe we currently have adequate liquidity to cover all near- and long-term debt obligations\nand operating expenses.\nFuture Capital Needs\nOur short- and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of making principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings; funding our general operating costs;\nmaking dividend payments on our currently-designated preferred securities; making distributions to common stockholders (including non-controlling OP Unitholders, if any) to\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT; and, as capital is available, funding capital improvements on existing farms, repurchasing shares of preferred stock under our Repurchase\nProgram, and funding new farmland and farm-related acquisitions consistent with our investment strategy.\nIn the near term, we believe that our current and short-term cash resources will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our current level of operating costs, pay dividends on our\ncurrently-designated preferred securities, and fund our distributions to common stockholders (including non-controlling OP Unitholders). We expect to meet our long-term\nliquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including capacity under current lines of credit, long-term mortgage indebtedness and bond issuances, future equity\nissuances (including, but not limited to, shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, OP Units through our Operating Partnership as consideration for future acquisitions, and shares\nof common stock through our ATM Program), and other secured and unsecured borrowings.\nWe intend to use a significant portion of any current and future available liquidity to purchase additional farms and farm-related facilities as opportunities arise. We continue to\nactively seek and evaluate acquisitions of additional farms and farm-related facilities that satisfy our investment criteria, and we have several properties that are in various stages\nof our due diligence process. However, all potential acquisitions will be subject to our due diligence investigation of such properties, and there can be no assurance that we will\nbe successful in identifying or acquiring any properties in the future.\n38\nOperating Commitments and Obligations\nOperating Obligations\nIn connection with the execution of certain lease agreements, we have committed to provide capital improvements on certain of our farms. Below is a summary of certain of\nthose projects for which we have incurred or accrued costs as September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nObligated Amount Expended\nFarm Farm Total Completion or Accrued as of\nLocation(s) Acreage Commitment Date(1) September 30, 2024\nColumbia, OR 157 $ 1,800 (2) Q4 2024 $ 1,146\nSt. Lucie, FL 549 230 Q3 2025 185\nVentura, CA 402 1,000 (2) Q4 2025 448\nFranklin & Grant, WA, & Umatilla, OR 1,126 3,265 (2) Q4 2032 2,474\nWicomico & Caroline, MD, and Sussex,\n155 78\nDE 833 Q3 2034\nCharlotte, FL 975 800 (2) Q3 2034 150\n(1) Our obligation to provide capital to fund these improvements does not extend beyond these respective dates.\n(2) Pursuant to contractual agreements, we will earn additional rent on the cost of these capital improvements as the funds are disbursed by us.\nGround Lease Obligations\nIn connection with certain farms acquired through a leasehold interest, we assumed certain ground lease arrangements under which we are the lessee. Future minimum lease\npayments due under the remaining non-cancelable terms of these leases as of September 30, 2024, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nPeriod Future Lease Payments(1)\nFor the remaining three months ending December 31:2024 $ 40\nFor the fiscal years ending December 31:2025 62\n2026 62\n2027 62\n2028 62\nThereafter 631\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 919\nLess: imputed interest (374)\nPresent value of lease payments $ 545\n(1) Certain annual lease payments are set at the beginning of each year to then-current market rates (as determined by the lessor). The amounts shown above represent estimated amounts based on the lease rates\ncurrently in place.\nAs a result of these ground leases, we recorded lease expense of approximately $27,000 and $79,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively,\nand approximately $26,000 and $77,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nCash Flow Resources\nThe following table summarizes total net cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in\nthousands):\nFor the Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nNet change in cash from:\nOperating activities $ 17,966 $ 22,657 $ (4,691) (20.7)%\nInvesting activities 60,039 (1,086) 61,125 (5,628.5)%\nFinancing activities (83,363) (57,632) (25,731) 44.6 %\nNet change in Cash and cash equivalents $ (5,358) $ (36,061) $ 30,703 (85.1)%\nOperating Activities\nThe majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments we receive from our tenants, which is first used to fund our property-level operating\nexpenses, with any excess cash being primarily used for principal and interest\n39\npayments on our borrowings, management fees to our Adviser, administrative fees to our Administrator, and other corporate-level expenses. Cash provided by operating\nactivities decreased largely due to a decrease in fixed lease cash payments received (primarily due to the disposition of one farm in Florida, as well as reduced fixed lease\npayments attributable to those farms which were vacant, direct-operated, or on non-accrual basis during the current-year period), the payment of certain cash allowances\nprovided for in three leases that were executed during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an increase in cash payments made towards the acquisition of water\nassets. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cash payments received towards participation rent and a decrease in related party fees and interest payments made.\nInvesting Activities\nThe change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Florida for approximately $65.7 million during the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024, which resulted in a net gain of approximately $10.4 million, and a decrease in the amount of cash paid for capital improvements on\nexisting farms during the current-year period.\nFinancing Activities\nThe change in cash from financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in aggregate net cash proceeds received from preferred and common equity offerings of\napproximately $19.9 million, as well as increases in aggregate preferred stock repurchases of approximately $5.4 million and debt repayments of approximately $1.1 million.\nDebt Capital\nMetLife Facility\nAs amended, our credit facility with MetLife currently consists of $75.0 million of revolving equity lines of credit and an aggregate of $175.0 million of term notes (the\n“MetLife Facility”). We currently have $200,000 outstanding under the lines of credit and $36.9 million outstanding on the term notes. While $212.9 million of the full\ncommitment amount under the MetLife Facility remains undrawn, based on the level of collateral pledged, we currently have approximately $110.2 million of availability under\nthe MetLife Facility. The revolving equity lines of credit mature on December 15, 2033, and the draw period for both term notes expires on December 31, 2024, after which\nMetLife has no obligation to disburse any additional undrawn funds under the term notes. We have been in discussions with MetLife to extend the draw periods for the term\nnotes and currently expect to have an agreement finalized by the end of 2024.\nFarmer Mac Facility\nAs amended, our agreement with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) currently provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate amount of $225.0 million\n(the “Farmer Mac Facility”) by December 31, 2026, after which Farmer Mac has no obligation to purchase additional bonds under this facility. To date, we have issued\naggregate bonds of approximately $100.1 million under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nFarm Credit and Other Lenders\nSince September 2014, we have closed on multiple loans with various different Farm Credit associations (for additional information on these associations, see Note 4,\n“Borrowings,” within the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements). We also have borrowing relationships with several other agricultural lenders\nand are continuously reaching out to other lenders to establish prospective new relationships. As such, we expect to enter into additional borrowing agreements with existing and\nnew lenders in connection with certain potential new acquisitions in the future.\nEquity Capital\nThe following table provides information on equity sales that occurred since January 1, 2024 (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nWeighted-average\nNumber of Offering Price\nType of Issuance Shares Sold Per Share Gross Proceeds Net Proceeds(1)\nSeries E Preferred Stock 15,735 $ 24.98 $ 393 $ 354\nCommon Stock – ATM Program 346,216 13.52 4,680 4,633\n(1) Net of selling commissions and dealer-manager fees or underwriting discounts and commissions (in each case, as applicable).\nOur 2023 Registration Statement (as defined in Note 8, “Equity—Registration Statement,” within the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements)\npermits us to issue up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depository shares, subscription rights,\nand units, including through\n40\nseparate, concurrent offerings of two or more of such securities. To date, we have issued approximately $4.4 million of Series E Preferred Stock and $6.8 million of common\nstock under the 2023 Registration Statement.\nIn addition, we have the ability to, and expect to in the future, issue additional OP Units to third parties as consideration in future property acquisitions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of September 30, 2024, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFunds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) developed funds from operations (“FFO”) as a relative non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating\nperformance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the same basis as determined under GAAP. FFO, as defined\nby NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and\namortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We further present core FFO (“CFFO”) and adjusted FFO (“AFFO”)\nas additional non-GAAP financial measures of our operational performance, as we believe both CFFO and AFFO improve comparability on a period-over-period basis and are\nmore useful supplemental metrics for investors to use in assessing our operational performance on a more sustainable basis than FFO. We believe that these additional\nperformance metrics, along with the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, provide investors with helpful insight regarding how management measures our ongoing\nperformance, as each of CFFO and AFFO (and their respective per-share amounts) are used by management and our board of directors, as appropriate, in assessing overall\nperformance, as well as in certain decision-making analysis, including, but not limited to, the timing of acquisitions and potential equity raises (and the type of securities to\noffer in any such equity raises), the determination of any fee credits, and declarations of distributions on our common stock. The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein\nhave limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe\nthat net income is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure to each of FFO, CFFO, and AFFO.\nSpecifically, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors in better understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and\namortization expense on real estate assets, as we believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of\nthose assets, particularly with farmland real estate, the value of which does not diminish in a predictable manner over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Further, we\nbelieve that CFFO and AFFO are helpful in understanding our operating performance in that it removes certain items that, by their nature, are not comparable on a period-over-\nperiod basis and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. In addition, we believe that providing CFFO and AFFO as additional performance metrics allows\ninvestors to gauge our overall performance in a manner that is more similar to how our performance is measured by management (including their respective per-share amounts),\nas well as by analysts and the overall investment community.\nWe calculate CFFO by adjusting FFO for the following items:\n• Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses. Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (including due diligence costs on acquisitions not consummated and certain\nauditing and accounting fees incurred that were directly related to completed acquisitions or dispositions) are incurred for investment purposes and do not correlate with\nthe ongoing operations of our existing portfolio. Further, certain auditing and accounting fees incurred vary depending on the number and complexity of acquisitions or\ndispositions completed during the period. Due to the inconsistency in which these costs are incurred and how they have historically been treated for accounting purposes,\nwe believe the exclusion of these expenses improves comparability of our operating results on a period-to-period basis.\n• Other adjustments. We will adjust for certain non-recurring charges and receipts and will explain such adjustments accordingly. We believe the exclusion of these\namounts improves comparability of our operating results on a period-to-period basis and will apply consistent definitions of CFFO for all prior-year periods presented to\nprovide consistency and better comparability.\nFurther, we calculate AFFO by adjusting CFFO for the following items:\n• Rent adjustments. This adjustment removes the effects of straight-lining rental income, as well as the amortization related to above-market lease values and certain non-\ncash lease incentives and accretion related to below-market lease values, certain other deferred revenue, and tenant improvements, resulting in rental income reflected on\na modified accrual cash basis. In addition to these adjustments, we also modify the calculation of cash rents within our definition of AFFO to provide greater consistency\nand comparability due to the period-to-period volatility in which cash rents are\n41\nreceived. To coincide with our tenants’ harvest seasons, our leases typically provide for cash rents to be paid at various points throughout the lease year, usually annually\nor semi-annually. As a result, cash rents received during a particular period may not necessarily be comparable to other periods or represent the cash rents indicative of a\ngiven lease year. Therefore, we further adjust AFFO to normalize the cash rent received pertaining to a lease year over that respective lease year on a straight-line basis,\nresulting in cash rent being recognized ratably over the period in which the cash rent is earned. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we adjusted our\ndefinition of AFFO to exclude from this adjustment the removal of lease incentives that were a result of previous cash disbursements made by us to or on behalf of our\ntenants. The results of all periods presented, including those of the prior year, have been adjusted in the table below to conform with this new definition.\n• Amortization of debt issuance costs. The amortization of costs incurred to obtain financing is excluded from AFFO, as it is a non-cash expense item that is not directly\nrelated to the operating performance of our properties.\n• Other adjustments. We will adjust for certain non-cash charges and receipts and will explain such adjustments accordingly. We believe the exclusion of such non-cash\namounts improves comparability of our operating results on a period-to-period basis and will apply consistent definitions of AFFO for all prior-year periods presented to\nprovide consistency and better comparability.\nWe believe the foregoing adjustments aid our investors’ understanding of our ongoing operational performance.\nFFO, CFFO and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, which, unlike FFO, CFFO, and AFFO, generally reflects all cash effects\nof transactions and other events in the determination of net income, and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash\nflows from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparisons of FFO, CFFO, and AFFO, using the NAREIT definition for FFO and the\ndefinitions above for CFFO and AFFO, to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the definitions used by\nsuch REITs.\nDiluted funds from operations (“Diluted FFO”), diluted core funds from operations (“Diluted CFFO”), and diluted adjusted funds from operations (“Diluted AFFO”) per share\nare FFO, CFFO, and AFFO, respectively, divided by the weighted-average number of total shares (including shares of our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling\nlimited partners) outstanding on a fully-diluted basis during a period. We believe that diluted earnings per share is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure to each of\nDiluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share. Because many REITs provide Diluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share information to the investment community, we believe these\nare useful supplemental measures when comparing us to other REITs.\nWe believe that FFO, CFFO, and AFFO and Diluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for\nevaluating our FFO, CFFO, and AFFO results in the same manner that investors use net income and EPS in evaluating net income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our FFO, CFFO, and AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 to the most directly-comparable\nGAAP measure, net income, and a computation of diluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share, using the weighted-average number of total shares (including shares of our\ncommon stock and OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders) outstanding during the respective periods (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\n42\nFor the Three Months Ended September For the Nine Months Ended September\n30, 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 6 $ 3,141 $ 12,750 $ 12,746\nLess: Aggregate dividends declared on and gains on or charges related to extinguishment of\ncumulative redeemable preferred stock, net(1) (5,793) (6,105) (17,742) (18,303)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ (5,787) $ (2,964) $ (4,992) $ (5,557)\nPlus: Real estate and intangible depreciation and amortization 8,805 9,244 26,407 27,407\nPlus (less): Losses (gains) on dispositions of real estate assets, net 832 4 (6,641) (5,910)\nPlus: Impairment charges 2,106 — 2,106 —\nAdjustments for unconsolidated entities(2) 14 22 52 69\nFFO available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ 5,970 $ 6,306 $ 16,932 $ 16,009\nPlus (less): Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (credits), net 10 33 (3) 126\nPlus: Other nonrecurring charges, net(3) 288 50 349 1,328\nCFFO available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ 6,268 $ 6,389 $ 17,278 $ 17,463\nNet rent adjustment (1,229) (1,268) (2,703) (3,591)\nPlus: Amortization of debt issuance costs 221 247 687 766\n(Less) plus: Other non-cash (receipts) charges, net(4) (734) 1 (1,903) 279\nAFFO available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ 4,526 $ 5,369 $ 13,359 $ 14,917\nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 35,838,442 35,822,123 35,838,442 35,698,458\nWeighted-average common non-controlling OP Units outstanding — — — —\nWeighted-average shares of common shares outstanding, fully diluted 35,838,442 35,822,123 35,838,442 35,698,458\nDiluted FFO per weighted-average common share $ 0.17 $ 0.18 $ 0.47 $ 0.45\nDiluted CFFO per weighted-average common share $ 0.17 $ 0.18 $ 0.48 $ 0.49\nDiluted AFFO per weighted-average common share $ 0.13 $ 0.15 $ 0.37 $ 0.42\nDistributions declared per common share $ 0.14 $ 0.14 $ 0.42 $ 0.41\n(1) Includes (i) cash dividends paid on our cumulative redeemable preferred stock, (ii) the value of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plant (the “DRIP”),\nand (iii) the net (gain) loss recognized as a result of shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock that were redeemed during the respective periods.\n(2) Represents our pro-rata share of depreciation expense recorded in unconsolidated entities during the respective periods.\n(3) Consists primarily of (i) net property and casualty losses (recoveries) recorded and the cost of related repairs expensed as a result of the damage caused to certain improvements by natural disasters on\ncertain of our farms, (ii) costs related to the amendment, termination, and listing of shares from the Series C Offering that were expensed, (iii) the write-off of certain unallocated costs related to a prior\nuniversal shelf registration statement, and (iv) costs incurred to implement our share repurchase program.\n(4) Consists of (i) the amount of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock paid via issuing new shares (pursuant to the DRIP), (ii) the net (gain) loss recognized as a result of shares of cumulative redeemable\npreferred stock that were redeemed, which were non-cash (gains) charges, (iii) our remaining pro-rata share of (income) loss recorded from investments in unconsolidated entities, and (iv) less non-cash\nincome recorded as a result of additional water assets received as consideration in certain transactions.\nNet Asset Value\nReal estate companies are required to record real estate using the historical cost basis of the real estate, adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization, and, as a result,\nthe carrying value of the real estate does not typically change as the fair value of the assets change. Thus, one challenge is determining the fair value of the real estate in order to\nallow stockholders to see the value of the real estate increase or decrease over time, which we believe is useful to our investors.\nDetermination of Fair Value\nOur Board of Directors reviews and approves the valuations of our properties pursuant to a valuation policy approved by our Board of Directors (the “Valuation Policy”). Such\nreview and approval occurs in three phases: (i) prior to its quarterly meetings, the Board of Directors receives written valuation recommendations and supporting materials that\nare provided by professionals of the Adviser and Administrator, with oversight and direction from the chief valuation officer, who is also employed by the Administrator\n(collectively, the “Valuation Team”); (ii) the valuation committee of the Board of Directors (the “Valuation Committee”), which is comprised entirely of independent directors,\nmeets to review the valuation recommendations and supporting materials; and (iii) after the Valuation Committee concludes its meeting, it and the chief valuation officer\n43\npresent the Valuation Committee’s findings to the entire Board of Directors so that the full Board of Directors may review and approve the fair values of our properties in\naccordance with the Valuation Policy. Further, on a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors reviews the Valuation Policy to determine if changes thereto are advisable and also\nreviews whether the Valuation Team has applied the Valuation Policy consistently.\nPer the Valuation Policy, our valuations are generally derived based on the following:\n• For properties acquired within 12 months prior to the date of valuation, the purchase price of the property will generally be used as the current fair value unless overriding\nfactors apply. In situations where OP Units are issued as partial or whole consideration in connection with the acquisition of a property, the fair value of the property will\ngenerally be the lower of: (i) the agreed-upon purchase price between the seller and the buyer (as shown in the purchase and sale agreement or contribution agreement and\nusing the agreed-upon pricing of the OP Units, if applicable), or (ii) the value as determined by an independent, third-party appraiser.\n• For real estate we acquired more than one year prior to the date of valuation, we determine the fair value either by relying on estimates provided by independent, third-\nparty appraisers or through an internal valuation process. In addition, if significant capital improvements take place on a property, we will typically have those properties\nreappraised upon completion of the project by an independent, third-party appraiser. In any case, we intend to have each property valued by an independent, third-party\nappraiser via a full appraisal at least once every three years, with interim values generally being determined by either: (i) a restricted appraisal (a “desk appraisal”)\nperformed by an independent, third-party appraiser, or (ii) our internal valuation process.\nVarious methodologies were used, both by the appraisers and in our internal valuations, to determine the fair value of our real estate, including the sales comparison, income\ncapitalization (or a discounted cash flow analysis), and cost approaches of valuation. In performing their analyses, the appraisers typically (i) conducted site visits to the\nproperties (where full appraisals were performed), (ii) discussed each property with our Adviser and reviewed property-level information, including, but not limited to, property\noperating data, prior appraisals (as available), existing lease agreements, farm acreage, location, access to water and water rights, potential for future development, and other\nproperty-level information, and (iii) reviewed information from a variety of sources about regional market conditions applicable to each of our properties, including, but not\nlimited to, recent sale prices of comparable farmland, market rents for similar farmland, estimated marketing and exposure time, market capitalization rates, and the current\neconomic environment, among others. In performing our internal valuations, we will consider the most recent appraisal available and use similar methodologies in determining\nan updated fair value. We will also obtain updated market data related to the property, such as updated sales and market rent comparisons and market capitalization rates, and\nperform an updated assessment of the tenants’ credit risk profiles, among others. Sources of this data may come from market inputs from recent acquisitions of our own\nportfolio of real estate, recent appraisals of properties we own that are similar in nature and in the same region (as applicable) as the property being valued, market conditions\nand trends we observe in our due diligence process, and conversations with appraisers, brokers, and farmers.\nA breakdown of the methodologies used to value our properties and the aggregate value as of September 30, 2024, determined by each method is shown in the table below\n(dollars in thousands, except in footnotes):\nNumber Total Farm Acre-feet Net Cost Current % of Total\nValuation Method of Farms Acres Acres of Water Basis(1) Fair Value Fair Value\nPurchase Price — — — 5,478 $ 1,288 $ 1,288 0.1%\nInternal Valuation 3 6,189 4,730 — 19,819 36,000 2.5%\nThird-party Appraisal(2) 165 105,647 87,667 48,309 1,252,472 1,425,074 97.4%\nTotal 168 111,836 92,397 53,787 $ 1,273,579 $ 1,462,362 100.0%\n(1) Consists of the initial acquisition price (including the costs allocated to both tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed), plus subsequent improvements and other capitalized costs paid\nfor by us that were associated with the properties, and adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization.\n(2) Appraisals performed between September 2023 and September 2024.\nSome of the significant assumptions used by appraisers and the Valuation Team in valuing our portfolio as of September 30, 2024, include land values per farmable acre, market\nrental rates per farmable acre and the resulting net operating income (“NOI”) at the property level, and capitalization rates, among others. These assumptions were applied on a\nfarm-by-farm basis and were selected based on several factors, including comparable land sales, surveys of both existing and current market rates, discussions with other brokers\nand farmers, soil quality, size, location, and other factors deemed appropriate. A summary of these significant assumptions as of September 30, 2024, is provided in the\nfollowing table:\n44\nAppraisal Assumptions Internal Valuation Assumptions\nRange Weighted Range Weighted\n(Low - High) Average (Low - High) Average\nLand Value (per farmable acre) $708 – $128,519 $ 33,964 $5,918 – $5,918 $ 5,918\nMarket NOI (per farmable acre) $150 – $3,979 $ 1,786 N/A N/A\nMarket Capitalization Rate 2.20% – 6.20% 4.44% N/A N/A\nNote: Figures in the table above apply only to the farmland portion of our portfolio and exclude assumptions made relating to farm-related facilities (e.g., cooling facilities), and other structures on our properties\n(e.g., residential housing), as their aggregate value was considered to be insignificant in relation to that of the farmland.\nOur Valuation Team reviews the appraisals, including the significant assumptions and inputs used in determining the appraised values, and considers any developments that may\nhave occurred since the time the appraisals were performed. Developments considered that may have an impact on the fair value of our real estate include, but are not limited\nto, changes in tenant credit profiles, changes in lease terms (such as expirations and notices of non-renewals or to vacate), and potential asset sales (particularly those at prices\ndifferent from the appraised values of our properties).\nManagement believes that the purchase prices of the farms acquired during the previous 12 months and the most recent appraisals available for the farms acquired prior to the\nprevious 12 months fairly represent the current market values of the properties as of September 30, 2024, and, accordingly, did not make any adjustment to these values.\nA quarterly roll-forward of the change in our portfolio value for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the prior value basis as of June 30, 2024, is provided in the\ntable below (dollars in thousands):\nTotal portfolio fair value as of June 30, 2024 $ 1,485,653\nLess: Cumulative adjustment to cost basis of water assets acquired in prior periods. (29)\nChange in value of farms during the three months ended September 30, 2024\nFarms valued via third-party appraisals $ (23,262)\nNet change in value of farms during the three months ended September 30, 2024 (23,262)\nTotal portfolio fair value as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,462,362\nManagement also determined fair values of all of its long-term borrowings and preferred stock. Using a discounted cash flow analysis, management determined that the fair\nvalue of all long-term encumbrances on our properties as of September 30, 2024, was approximately $500.0 million, as compared to a carrying value (excluding unamortized\nrelated debt issuance costs) of approximately $533.1 million. The fair values of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Term Preferred Stock were\ndetermined using the closing stock prices as of September 30, 2024, of $22.77 per share, $21.80 per share, and $24.50 per share, respectively. Finally, pursuant to Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority Rule 2310(b)(5), with the assistance of a third-party valuation expert, we determined the estimated value of our Series E Preferred Stock to be\n$25.00 per share as of September 30, 2024 (see Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-Q).\nCalculation of Estimated Net Asset Value\nTo provide our stockholders with an estimate of the fair value of our real estate assets, we intend to estimate the fair value of our farms and farm-related properties and provide\nan estimated net asset value (“NAV”) on a quarterly basis. NAV is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial position of an equity REIT and is calculated as total equity,\nadjusted for the increase or decrease in fair value of our real estate assets and long-term borrowings (including any preferred stock required to be treated as debt for GAAP\npurposes) relative to their respective cost bases. Further, we calculate NAV per common share by dividing NAV by our total common shares outstanding (consisting of our\ncommon stock and OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners).\nThe fair values presented above and their usage in the calculation of net asset value per share presented below have been prepared by and are the responsibility of management.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has neither examined, compiled, nor performed any procedures with respect to the fair values or the calculation of net asset value per common\nshare, which utilizes information that is not disclosed within the financial statements, and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we estimate the NAV per common share to be $15.57. A reconciliation of NAV to total equity, which we believe is the most directly-comparable\nGAAP measure, is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per-share data):\n45\nTotal equity per balance sheet $ 691,204\nFair value adjustment for long-term assets:\nLess: net cost basis of real estate holdings and related assets(1) $ (1,273,579)\nPlus: estimated fair value of real estate holdings(2) 1,462,362\nNet fair value adjustment for real estate holdings 188,783\nFair value adjustment for long-term liabilities:\nPlus: book value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3) 593,435\nLess: fair value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3)(4) (559,136)\nNet fair value adjustment for long-term indebtedness 34,299\nEstimated NAV 914,286\nLess: aggregate fair value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock(5) (356,302)\nEstimated NAV available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ 557,984\nTotal common shares and non-controlling OP Units outstanding 35,838,442\nEstimated NAV per common share and OP Unit $ 15.57\n(1) Per Net Cost Basis as presented in the table above.\n(2) Per Current Fair Value as presented in the table above.\n(3) Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of notes and bonds payable) and the Series D Term Preferred Stock.\n(4) Long-term notes and bonds payable were valued using a discounted cash flow model. The Series D Term Preferred Stock was valued based on its closing stock price as of September 30, 2024.\n(5) The Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were valued based on their respective closing stock prices as of September 30, 2024, while the Series E Preferred Stock was valued at its\nliquidation value, as discussed above.\nA quarterly roll-forward in the estimated NAV per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is provided below:\nEstimated NAV per common share and non-controlling OP Unit as of June 30, 2024 $ 17.59\nLess net loss attributable to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders (0.16)\nAdjustments for net change in valuations:\nNet change in unrealized fair value of farmland portfolio(1) $ (0.70)\nNet change in unrealized fair value of long-term indebtedness (0.46)\nNet change in unrealized fair value of preferred equity securities (0.48)\nNet change in valuations (1.64)\nLess distributions on common stock and non-controlling OP Units (0.14)\nPlus (less) net accretive (dilutive) effect of equity issuances and redemptions, net (0.08)\nEstimated NAV per common share and non-controlling OP Unit as of September 30, 2024 $ 15.57\n(1) The net change in unrealized fair value of our farmland portfolio consists of three components: (i) a decrease of $0.65 per share due to the net depreciation in value of the farms that were valued during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024, (ii) an increase of $0.25 per share due to the decrease in net book value of our real estate holdings as a result of the aggregate depreciation and amortization\nexpense recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and (iii) a decrease of $0.30 per share due to capital improvements made on certain farms that have not yet been considered in the\ndetermination of the respective farms’ estimated fair values.\nComparison of estimated NAV and estimated NAV per common share, using the definitions above, to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be\nmeaningful due to possible differences in the calculation or application of the definition of NAV used by such REITs. In addition, the trading price of our common shares may\ndiffer significantly from our most recent estimated NAV per common share calculation. For example, while we estimated our NAV per common share to be $15.57 as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, based on the calculation above, the closing price of our common stock on September 30, 2024, was $13.90 per share.\nThe determination of estimated NAV is subjective and involves a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, and minor adjustments to these assumptions, judgments, or\nestimates may have a material impact on our overall portfolio valuation. In addition, many of the assumptions used are sensitive to market conditions and can change frequently.\nChanges in the market environment and other events that may occur during our ownership of these properties may cause the values reported above to vary from the actual fair\nvalue that may be obtained in the open market. Further, while management believes the values presented reflect current market conditions, the ultimate amount realized on any\nasset will be based on the timing of such dispositions and the then-current market conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate realized value upon disposition of an\nasset will approximate the estimated fair value above.\n46\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect\nmarket-sensitive instruments. The primary market risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk. Certain of our existing leases contain escalations based\non market indices, such as the consumer price index (“CPI”), and while very little of our existing borrowings are subject to variable interest rates, the interest rates on the\nmajority of our fixed-rate borrowings are fixed for a finite period before converting to variable rate. Although we seek to mitigate this risk by including certain provisions in\nmany of our leases, such as escalation clauses or adjusting the rent to prevailing market rents at various intervals, these features do not eliminate this risk.\nCurrently, over 99.9% of our borrowings are at fixed rates, and on a weighted-average basis, these rates are fixed at an effective interest rate (after interest patronage) of 3.40%\nfor another 3.7 years. As such, with respect to our current borrowings, we believe fluctuations in interest rates would have a minimal impact on our net income. However,\ninterest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings outstanding (excluding our\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock) was approximately $500.0 million.\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical change in fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings at September 30, 2024, if market interest rates had been one or two\npercentage points lower or higher than those rates in place as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\nChange in Market Interest Rates Carrying Value(1) Fair Value Difference\n2% decrease $ 533,060 $ 526,362 $ (6,698)\n1% decrease 533,060 512,867 (20,193)\nNo change 533,060 499,968 (33,092)\n1% increase 533,060 487,640 (45,420)\n2% increase 533,060 475,844 (57,216)\n(1) Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of notes and bonds payable), excluding unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIn the future, we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes, primarily as a result of additional borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of\nour farmland investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to\nlower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or, in limited cases, at variable rates with the lowest margins available and,\nwhere available, with the ability to convert to fixed rates in the future. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, to mitigate\nthe interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nIn addition to changes in interest rates, the fair value of our farmland portfolio is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes\nin the creditworthiness of our tenants. Materially adverse changes in the fair value of our real estate may affect our ability to refinance our debt, if necessary.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of September 30, 2024, our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of September 30, 2024, in providing a reasonable level of assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange\nAct is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in applicable SEC rules and forms, including providing a reasonable level of assurance\nthat information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized\nthat any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of necessarily achieving the desired control objectives, and\nmanagement was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n47\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter endedS eptember 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n48\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business incidental to our business, we may be involved in various legal proceedings from time to time which we may not consider material. We are\nnot currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any such material legal proceedings threatened against us.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to certain risks and events that, if they occur, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our\nsecurities. For a discussion of these risks, please refer to the section captioned, “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2023. There have been no material changes to risks associated with our business or investment in our securities from those previously set forth in the report described above.\nThe risks in our Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results in the future.\nItem 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nOn May 17, 2024, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $20.0 million of our 6.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable\nPreferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and up to $35.0 million of our 6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value\n$0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock” and, collectively, the “Repurchase Program”). The Board’s authorization of the Repurchase Program may be suspended or\ndiscontinued at any time, does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of securities, and expires on May 17, 2025. Under the Repurchase Program, repurchases are\nintended to be implemented through open market transactions on U.S. exchanges and/or in privately-negotiated transactions facilitated by a third-party broker acting as agent for\nus in accordance with applicable securities laws. Any repurchases will be made during applicable trading window periods or pursuant to applicable Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our purchases of our Series B Preferred Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Maximum Dollar Value of Shares\nPart of Publicly Announced Plans or That May Yet Be Purchased\nPeriod Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share(1) Program Under the Plans or Programs\nJuly 2024 33,334 $ 21.36 33,334 $ 18,155,882\nAugust 2024 20,962 21.54 20,962 17,704,316\nSeptember 2024 6,145 21.35 6,145 17,573,097\nTotal 60,441 $ 21.42 60,441 $ 17,573,097\n(1) Excludes commissions and transaction costs.\nThe following table provides information with respect to our purchases of our Series C Preferred Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nTotal Number of Shares Purchased as Maximum Dollar Value of Shares\nPart of Publicly Announced Plans or That May Yet Be Purchased\nPeriod Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share(1) Program Under the Plans or Programs\nJuly 2024 47,788 $ 21.09 47,788 $ 32,232,501\nAugust 2024 55,770 21.06 55,770 31,057,706\nSeptember 2024 12,046 21.16 12,046 30,802,763\nTotal 115,604 $ 21.08 115,604 $ 30,802,763\n(1) Excludes commissions and transaction costs.\nSee Note 8, “Equity—Repurchase Program,” within the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our\nRepurchase Program.\n49\nItem 3.

In particular, the\nthird-party valuation service reviewed the amount resulting from the consolidated total equity of the Company (as reflected on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance\nSheet within its Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles), adjusted for the fair value of its long-term assets (i.e., its real estate holdings) and long-term liabilities (each as disclosed within the Form 10-K (to\nwhich this exhibit is attached) under “Non-GAAP Financial Information—Net Asset Value”), divided by the number of shares of the Company's Series E Preferred Stock\noutstanding. Based on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the $25.00 per share stated value of the Company's Series E Preferred\nStock, the Company has determined that the estimated value of its Series E Preferred Stock as of September 30, 2024, is $25.00 per share."

BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are an externally-managed, agricultural REIT that is engaged in the business of owning and leasing farmland. We are not a grower of crops, nor do we typically farm the\nproperties we own. We currently own 168 farms comprised of 111,836 acres across 15 states in the U.S. We also own several farm-related facilities that are necessary to the\nfarming operations on the underlying farmland.\nOur farmland is predominantly concentrated in locations where farmers are able to grow either fresh produce annual row crops (e.g., certain berries and vegetables), which are\ntypically planted and harvested annually, or certain permanent crops (e.g., almonds, blueberries, pistachios, and wine grapes). To a much lesser extent, we also own farms that\ngrow certain commodity crops (e.g., corn and beans). In addition, we own several farm-related facilities, such as cooling facilities, packinghouses, processing facilities, and\nvarious storage facilities. While our focus will continue to be on farmland growing either fresh produce annual row crops or certain permanent crops, in the future, we expect to\nacquire more farmland that grows commodity crops on a selective basis, as well as more farm-related facilities.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business activities through an Umbrella Partnership Real Estate Investment Trust (“UPREIT”) structure, by which all of our properties are\nheld, directly or indirectly, by Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). We control the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and currently\nown, directly or indirectly, 100.0% of the common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”). We have in the past, and may in the future,\noffer equity ownership in our Operating Partnership by issuing additional OP Units to farmland owners as consideration for acquiring their farms. See “Our Investment Process\n—Types of Investments” below for additional information regarding OP Units.\nWe are managed by our external adviser, Gladstone Management Corporation (the “Adviser”), and Gladstone Administration, LLC (the “Administrator”), provides\nadministrative services to us. Both our Adviser and our Administrator are affiliates of ours and each other.\nUpon the pricing of our initial public offering (the “IPO”), on January 29, 2013, our shares of common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the\nsymbol “LAND.” Our shares of 6.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) are traded on Nasdaq\nunder the symbol “LANDO,” our shares of 6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) are traded on\nNasdaq under the symbol “LANDP,” and our shares of 5.00% Series D Cumulative Term Preferred Stock (the “Series D Term Preferred Stock”) are traded on Nasdaq under\nthe symbol “LANDM.” In addition, we have registered our 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series E Preferred\nStock”). The Series E Preferred Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, and there is currently no public market for shares of this security.\nOur Investment Objectives and Our Strategy\nOur principal business objective is to maximize stockholder returns through a combination of: (i) monthly cash distributions to our stockholders, which we hope to sustain and\nincrease through long-term growth in cash flows from increased rents; (ii) appreciation of our land; and (iii) capital gains derived from the sale of our properties. Our primary\nstrategy to achieve our business objective is to invest in and further diversify our current portfolio of primarily triple-net-leased farmland and farm related properties. In\naddition, we may also acquire certain commercial properties used by businesses that support agricultural communities. This strategy includes the following components:\n• Owning Farms, Farm-Related Real Estate, and Real Estate used by Businesses that Support Farming Communities for Income . We own and intend to primarily acquire\nadditional farms and farm-related properties and lease them to independent and corporate farming operations, including sellers who desire to continue farming the land\nafter we acquire the property from them. We may also acquire commercial properties used by businesses that support farming communities. Such businesses may\ninclude, but are not limited to, farmer-owned cooperatives, rural infrastructure providers, and other agribusinesses. We intend to hold most acquired properties for many\nyears and to generate stable and increasing rental income from leasing these properties.\n• Owning Farms, Farm-Related Real Estate, and Real Estate used by Businesses that Support Farming Communities for Appreciation . We intend to lease acquired\nproperties over the long term. However, from time to time, we may sell one or more properties if we believe it to be in the best interests of our stockholders and best to\nmaintain the overall\n5\nTable of Content\nvalue of our portfolio. Potential purchasers may include real estate developers desiring to develop the property, financial purchasers seeking to acquire property for\ninvestment purposes, or farmers who have operated or seek to operate the land. Accordingly, we will seek to acquire properties that we believe have potential for long-\nterm appreciation in value.\n• Continue Expanding our Operations Geographically. Our properties are currently located in 15 states across the U.S., and we expect that we will acquire properties in\nother farming regions of the U.S. in the future. While our primary regions of focus are the West and the Southeast regions of the U.S., we believe other regions of the\nU.S., such as the Pacific Northwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, offer attractive locations for expansion, and, to a lesser extent, we also expect to seek farmland acquisitions\nin certain regions of the Midwest on a select, opportunistic basis, as well as other areas in the U.S.\n• Continue Expanding our Crop Varieties. Currently, the majority of tenants who farm our properties grow either annual row crops dedicated to fresh produce, such as\nberries (e.g., strawberries and raspberries) and fresh vegetables (e.g., tomatoes, lettuce, and bell peppers), or certain permanent crops (e.g., pistachios, almonds,\nblueberries, and wine grapes). To a lesser extent, we also own farms growing certain commodity crops (e.g., corn and beans). We will seek to continue our recent\nexpansion into other permanent crops and, to a lesser extent, commodity crops, while maintaining our focus on annual row-crop farms growing fresh produce and farms\ngrowing certain permanent crops.\n• Using Leverage. To maximize our number of investments, we intend to borrow through loans secured by long-term mortgages on our properties, and we may also\nborrow funds on a short-term basis or incur other indebtedness.\n• Owning Mortgages on Farms and Farm-Related Real Estate. In certain circumstances, we may make senior secured first lien mortgage loans (secured by farms or farm-\nrelated real estate) to farmers for the purchase of farmland, properties related to farming and for other farm related needs. We do not expect that, over time, our\nmortgages held will exceed 5.0% of the fair value of our total assets.\nWe intend to acquire more farmland and farm-related properties in our regions of focus that is already or will be leased to farmers, and we expect that most of our future tenants\nwill be independent or corporate farming and business operations that are all unrelated to us. We intend to continue to lease the majority of our farms and farm-related facilities\non a triple-net lease basis to tenants who sell their products through national corporate marketers-distributors. We may also acquire and lease commercial properties used by\nbusinesses that support farming communities. We expect to continue to earn rental income from our real estate assets.\nOur Investment Process\nTypes of Investments\nWe expect that substantially all of our investments will continue to be comprised of income-producing agricultural real property, and we expect that the majority of our leases\nwill continue to be structured as triple-net leases. We may also acquire properties used by businesses that support farming communities. Investments will not be restricted as to\ngeographical areas, but we expect that most of our investments in farmland real estate will continue to be made within the U.S. Currently, our properties are located across 15\nstates in the U.S.\nWe anticipate that we will make substantially all of our investments through our Operating Partnership. Our Operating Partnership may acquire interests in real property in\nexchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock, OP Units, cash, or through a combination of the three. OP Units issued by our Operating Partnership will be\nredeemable at the option of the holder for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis at any time after holding the OP Units for one year. We\ncurrently, and may in the future, hold some or all of our interests in real properties through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, each classified as a qualified REIT\nsubsidiary.\nProperty Acquisitions and Leasing\nWe anticipate that many of the farms and farm-related facilities we purchase will be acquired from independent farmers or agricultural companies and that they will\nsimultaneously lease the properties back from us. These transactions will provide the tenants with an alternative to other financing sources, such as borrowing, mortgaging real\nproperty, or selling securities. We anticipate that some of our transactions will be in conjunction with acquisitions, recapitalizations, or other corporate transactions affecting our\ntenants. We also expect that many of the farms and farm-related facilities we acquire will be purchased from owners who do not farm the property but rather lease the property\nto other tenant-farmers. In situations such as these, we intend to have a lease in place prior to or simultaneously with acquiring the property. For a discussion of the risks\nassociated with leasing property to leveraged tenants, see Part I, Item 1A,“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations—Some of our tenants may be unable to\npay rent, which could adversely affect our cash available to make distributions to our stockholders or otherwise impair the value of your investment.”\n6\nTable of Content\nWe intend to own and lease primarily single-tenant, agricultural real property, and we may acquire and lease properties used by businesses that support farming communities.\nGenerally, we will lease properties to tenants that our Adviser deems creditworthy under triple-net leases that will be full-recourse obligations of our tenants or their affiliates.\nMost of our agricultural leases have original terms ranging from 3 to 10 years for farms growing annual row crops and 7 to 15 years for properties growing permanent crops,\noften with options to extend the lease further. Rent is generally payable to us in advance on either an annual or semi-annual basis, with such rent typically subject to periodic\nescalation clauses provided for within the lease. The escalation clauses may specify fixed dollar amounts or percentage increases each year, or they may be variable, based on\nstandard cost of living or inflation indices. In addition, some leases that are longer-term in nature may require a regular survey of comparable land rents, with the rent owed per\nthe lease being adjusted to reflect then-current market rents. We also have leases that include a variable rent component based on the gross revenues earned on the respective\nfarm. In these types of agreements, we will generally require the lease to include the guarantee of a minimum amount of rental income that satisfies our investment return\ncriteria.\nWe believe that we can acquire farmland that we will be able to lease at annual rental rates providing net capitalization rates generally ranging from 4% to 7% or more of the\nproperties’ market values. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve this level of rental rates. Since rental contracts in the farming business for annual\nrow crops are customarily short-term agreements, rental rates are typically renegotiated regularly to then-current market rates.\nUnderwriting Criteria and Due Diligence Process\nSelecting the Property\nWe consider selecting the right properties to purchase or finance as one of the most important aspects of our business. Buying quality farmland that can be used to grow a\nvariety of different crops and that is located in desirable locations is essential to our success.\nOur Adviser works with real estate contacts in agricultural markets throughout the U.S. to assess available properties and farming areas. We believe that our Adviser is\nexperienced in selecting valuable farmland and will use this expertise to identify promising properties. The following is a list of important factors in our selection of farmland:\n• Water availability. Availability of water is essential to farming. We seek to purchase properties with ample access to water through an operating well on site or rights to\nuse a well or other source that is located nearby. Additionally, we may, in the future, consider acquiring properties that rely on rainfall for water if the tenant on that\nproperty mitigates the drought risk by purchasing drought insurance. Typically, leases on properties that would rely on rainfall would be longer term in nature.\n• Soil composition. In addition to water, for farming efforts to be successful, the soil must be suitable for growing crops. We will not buy or finance any real property that\ndoes not have soil conditions that we believe are favorable for growing the crops farmed on the property, except to the extent that a portion of an otherwise suitable\nproperty, while not favorable for growing the crops farmed on the property, may be utilized to build structures used in the farming business, such as cooling facilities,\npackinghouses, distribution centers, greenhouses, and storage facilities.\n• Location. Farming also requires optimal climate and growing seasons. We typically seek to purchase properties in locations that take advantage of climate conditions that\nare needed to grow fresh produce row crops. We intend to continue to expand throughout the U.S. in locations with productive farmland and financially sound tenant-\nfarmers.\n• Price. We intend to purchase and finance properties that we believe are a good value and that we will be able to rent profitably for farming over the long term. Generally,\nthe closer a property is located to urban developments, the higher the value of the property. As a result, properties that are currently located in close proximity to urban\ndevelopments are likely to be too expensive to justify farming over an extended period of time, and, therefore, we are unlikely to invest in such properties.\nOur Adviser will perform a due diligence review with respect to each potential property acquisition. Such review will include an evaluation of the physical condition of a\nproperty and an environmental site assessment to determine potential environmental liabilities associated with a property prior to its acquisition. One of the criteria that we look\nfor is whether mineral rights to such property, which constitute a separate estate from the surface rights to the property, have been sold to a third party. We generally seek to\ninvest in properties where mineral rights have not been sold to third parties; however, in cases where access to mineral rights would not affect the surface farming operations,\nwe may enter into a lease agreement for the extraction of minerals or other subterranean resources, as we have done in the past on a few of our properties. We may seek to\nacquire mineral rights in connection with the acquisition of future properties to the extent such mineral rights have been sold off and the investment acquisition of such rights is\nconsidered to be favorable after our due diligence review. Despite the conduct of these reviews, there can be no assurance that hazardous substances or waste, as determined\nunder present or future federal or state laws or regulations, will not be discovered on the property after we acquire it.\n7\nTable of Content\nOur Adviser will also physically inspect each property and the real estate surrounding it to estimate its value. Our Adviser’s due diligence will be primarily focused on valuing\neach property independent of its rental value to particular tenants to whom we plan to rent. The real estate valuations our Adviser performs will consider one or more of the\nfollowing items:\n• The comparable value of similar real property in the same general area of the prospective property, to the extent possible.\n• The comparable real estate rental rates for similar properties in the same general area of the prospective property.\n• Alternative uses for the property to determine if there is another use for the property that would give it higher value, including potential future conversion to urban or\nsuburban uses, such as commercial or residential development.\n• The assessed value as determined by the local real estate taxing authority.\nIn addition, our Adviser will generally supplement its valuation estimate with an independent real estate appraisal in connection with each investment that it considers. These\nappraisals may take into consideration, among other things, the terms and conditions of the particular lease transaction, the quality of the tenant’s credit and the conditions of the\ncredit markets at the time the lease transaction is negotiated. However, in certain limited situations, the actual purchase price of a property may be greater or less than its\nappraised value. When appropriate, our Adviser may engage experts to undertake some or all of the due diligence efforts described above.\nUpon completion of a due diligence investigation and a decision to proceed with an investment, the Adviser’s investment professionals who have primary responsibility for the\ninvestment present the investment opportunity to the Adviser’s investment committee. The investment committee then determines whether to pursue the potential investment.\nPrior to the closing of an investment, additional due diligence may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys, independent accountants, and other outside advisers, as\nappropriate.\nUnderwriting the Tenant, Due Diligence Process, and Negotiating Lease Provisions\nIn addition to property selection, underwriting the tenant that will lease the property is also an important aspect of our investment process. Our Adviser will evaluate the\ncreditworthiness of the tenant and assess its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its agricultural operations and other business operations, as applicable, to cover its\npayment obligations to us pursuant to our lease. The following is a list of criteria that our Adviser may consider when evaluating potential tenants for our properties, although\nnot all criteria may be present for each lease:\n• Experience. We believe that experience is the most significant characteristic when determining the creditworthiness of a tenant. Therefore, we seek to rent our properties\nto farmers that have an extensive track record of farming their property and particular crops successfully and, in some cases, to other tenants with meaningful\nmanagement experience and a strong operating history.\n• Financial Strength. We evaluate each potential tenant’s financial stability, considering factors such as its rating by a national credit rating agency, if any, management\nexperience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure, as applicable. We primarily seek to rent to farming operations that have financial\nresources to invest in planting and harvesting their crops. We generally require annual financial statements of new tenants to evaluate the financial capability of the\ntenant and its ability to perform its obligations under the lease.\n• Adherence to Quality Standards. We seek to lease our properties to those farmers that are committed to farming in a manner that will generate high-quality crops. We\nintend to identify such commitment through their track records of selling produce into established distribution chains and outlets.\n• Lease Provisions that Enhance and Protect Value. When appropriate, our Adviser attempts to include lease provisions that require our consent to specified tenant\nactivity or require the tenant to satisfy specific operating tests. These provisions may include, for example, requiring the tenant to meet operational or financial covenants\nor to indemnify us against environmental and other contingent liabilities. We believe that these provisions serve to protect our investments from adverse changes in the\noperating and financial characteristics of a tenant that may impact its ability to satisfy its obligations to us or that could reduce the value of our properties. Our Adviser\ngenerally also seeks covenants requiring tenants to receive our consent prior to any change in control of the tenant.\n• Credit Enhancement. To mitigate risk and enhance the likelihood of tenants satisfying their lease obligations, our Adviser may also seek cross-default provisions if a\ntenant has multiple obligations to us or seek a letter of credit or a guaranty of lease obligations from each tenant’s corporate affiliates, if any. We believe that these types\nof credit enhancements, if obtained, provide us with additional financial security.\n• Diversification. Our Adviser will seek to diversify our portfolio to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant, geographic location, facility type or crop type. By\ndiversifying our portfolio, our Adviser intends to reduce the adverse effect on our portfolio of a single underperforming investment or a downturn in any particular\ngeographic region. Many of the areas in which we purchase or finance properties are likely to have their own microclimates and, although they appear to be in close\nproximity to one another, generally will not be similarly affected by weather or\n8\nTable of Content\nother natural occurrences at the same time. We currently own properties in 15 different states across the U.S., and over time, we expect to expand our geographic focus\nto other areas in the U.S., including the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic. We will also attempt to continue diversifying our portfolio of properties by\nseeking additional farmland that grows a variety of different crop types, while maintaining our current focus of owning and leasing farmland that grows fresh produce\nannual row crops and certain permanent crops. Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—\nOverview—Portfolio Diversification,” for a summary of our portfolio diversification and concentrations.\nWhile our Adviser seeks tenants it believes to be creditworthy, tenants are not required to meet any minimum rating established by an independent credit rating agency. Our\nAdviser’s standards for determining whether a particular tenant is creditworthy will vary in accordance with a variety of factors relating to specific prospective tenants. The\ncreditworthiness of a tenant is determined on a tenant-by-tenant and case-by-case basis. Therefore, general standards for creditworthiness cannot be applied. We monitor our\ntenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by, among other things, periodically conducting site visits to the properties to ensure farming operations are taking place and to assess\nthe general maintenance of the properties. To date, no significant changes to credit quality of our tenants have been identified, and our tenants generally continue to pay pursuant\nto the terms of their respective leases.\nUse of Leverage\nOur strategy is to use borrowings as a financing mechanism in amounts that we believe will maximize the return to our stockholders. We generally expect to enter into borrowing\narrangements directly or indirectly through our Operating Partnership. Our governing documents and policies do not impose a limitation on the amount we may borrow against\nany single investment property, nor do they impose a limitation on our overall level of borrowing.\nWe believe that, by operating on a leveraged basis, we will have more funds available and, therefore, will be able to make more investments than would otherwise be possible.\nWe believe that this will allow us to assemble a more diversified portfolio. Our Adviser and Administrator use their best efforts to obtain financing on the most favorable terms\navailable to us.\nWe anticipate that our prospective lenders may also seek to include loan provisions whereby the termination or replacement of our Adviser would result in an event of default or\nan event requiring the immediate repayment of the full outstanding balance of the loan. The replacement or termination of our Adviser may, however, require the prior consent\nof a lender.\nWe may refinance properties during the term of a loan when, in the opinion of our Adviser, a decline in interest rates makes it advisable to prepay an existing mortgage loan,\nwhen an existing mortgage loan matures, or if an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to make such investment. The\nbenefits of the refinancing may include an increase in cash flow resulting from reduced debt service requirements, an increase in distributions to stockholders from proceeds of\nthe refinancing, if any, or an increase in property ownership if some refinancing proceeds are reinvested in real estate.\nInvestment Limitations\nThere are numerous limitations on the manner in which we may invest our funds. We have adopted a policy that without the permission of our Board of Directors, we will not:\n• invest 50% or more of our total assets in a single property at the time of investment;\n• invest in real property owned by our Adviser, any of its affiliates or any entity in which our Adviser or any of its affiliates have invested;\n• invest in commodities or commodity futures contracts, with this limitation not being applicable to futures contracts when used solely for the purpose of hedging in\nconnection with our ordinary business of investing in properties and making mortgage loans;\n• invest in contracts for the sale of real estate unless the contract is in recordable form and is appropriately recorded in the chain of title;\n• issue equity securities on a deferred payment basis or other similar arrangement;\n• grant warrants or options to purchase shares of our stock to our Adviser or its affiliates;\n• engage in trading, as compared with investment activities, or engage in the business of underwriting, or the agency distribution of, securities issued by other persons;\n• invest more than 5% of the value of our assets in the securities of any one issuer if the investment would cause us to fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT;\n• invest in securities representing more than 10% of the outstanding securities (by vote or value) of any one issuer if the investment would cause us to fail to maintain our\nqualification as a REIT; or\n9\nTable of Content\n• acquire securities in any company holding investments or engaging in activities prohibited in the foregoing clauses.\nConflict of Interest Policy\nWe have adopted policies to reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, our directors are subject to certain provisions of Maryland law that are designed to minimize\nconflicts. However, we cannot provide assurance that these policies or provisions of law will reduce or eliminate the influence of these conflicts.\nWe have adopted a policy that, without the approval of a majority of our independent directors, we will not:\n• acquire from or sell to any of our officers or directors, the employees of our Adviser or Administrator, or any entity in which any of our officers, directors, or such\nemployees has an interest of more than 5%, any assets or other property;\n• borrow from any of our directors or officers, the employees of our Adviser or Administrator, or any entity in which any of our officers, directors, or such employees has\nan interest of more than 5%; or\n• engage in any other transaction with any of our directors or officers, the employees of our Adviser or Administrator, or any entity in which any of our directors, officers,\nor such employees has an interest of more than 5%.\nConsistent with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we will not extend credit, or arrange for the extension of credit, to any of our directors and officers. Under the\nMaryland General Corporation Law, a contract or other transaction between us and one of our directors or officers or any other entity in which one of our directors or officers is\nalso a director or officer or has a material financial interest is not void or voidable solely on the grounds of the common directorship or interest, the fact that the director or\nofficer was present at the meeting at which the contract or transaction was approved or the fact that the director’s vote was counted in favor of the contract or transaction if:\n• the material facts relating to the common directorship or interest and as to the transaction are disclosed to our Board of Directors or a committee of our Board, and our\nBoard or the committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors not interested in the contract or\ntransaction, even if the disinterested directors do not constitute a quorum of the Board or committee;\n• the fact of the common directorship or interest is disclosed to our stockholders entitled to vote on the contract or transaction, and the contract or transaction is approved\nor ratified by a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote on the matter, other than shares owned of record or beneficially by the interested director,\ncorporation or entity; or\n• the contract or transaction is fair and reasonable to us as of the time authorized, approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee or the stockholders.\nOur policy also prohibits us from purchasing any real property from, or co-investing in any real property with, our Adviser, any of its affiliates, or any business in which our\nAdviser or any of its subsidiaries have invested. If we decide to change this policy on co-investments with our Adviser or its affiliates, we will seek approval of our independent\ndirectors.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics and business conduct applicable to all personnel of our Adviser and Administrator that complies with the guidelines set forth in Item 406 of\nRegulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This code establishes procedures for personal investments, restricts certain transactions by such personnel, and\nrequires the reporting of certain transactions and holdings by such personnel. A copy of this code is available for review, free of charge, on the Investors section of our website\nat www.GladstoneLand.com. The information contained on or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part\nof this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC. We intend to provide any required disclosure of any amendments to or waivers of this code of ethics by\nposting information regarding any such amendment or waiver to our website.\nOur Adviser and Administrator\nWe are externally managed by our Adviser. The officers, directors, and employees of our Adviser have significant experience in making investments in and lending to\nbusinesses of all sizes, including investing in real estate and making mortgage loans. We have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Adviser, which was most\nrecently amended and restated effective July 1, 2021 (the “Current Advisory Agreement”), under which our Adviser is responsible for managing our assets and liabilities, for\noperating our business on a day-to-day basis, and for identifying, evaluating, negotiating, and consummating investment transactions consistent with our investment policies as\ndetermined by our Board of Directors from time to time.\nOur Administrator employs our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president,\ngeneral counsel, and secretary), and their respective staffs and provides\n10\nTable of Content\nadministrative services to us under the amended and restated Administration Agreement entered into on February 1, 2013 (the “Administration Agreement”).\nDavid Gladstone, our chairman, chief executive officer, president, and largest stockholder, is also the chairman, chief executive officer, and the controlling stockholder of our\nAdviser and our Administrator. Terry Lee Brubaker, our chief operating officer, also serves as vice chairman, chief operating officer, and a member of the Board of Directors\nfor our Adviser and Administrator.\nOur Adviser has an investment committee that evaluates and approves each of our investments. This investment committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Gladstone,\nBrubaker, and Reiman; Mr. John Sateri, who is a managing director of our Adviser; and Ms. Laura Gladstone, who is a managing director of our Adviser. We believe that the\nreview process of our Adviser’s investment committee gives us a competitive advantage over other agricultural real estate companies because of the substantial experience that\nthe members possess and their unique perspective in evaluating the blend of corporate credit, real estate, and lease terms that collectively combine to provide an acceptable risk\nfor our investments.\nOur Adviser’s board of directors has empowered the investment committee to authorize and approve our investments, subject to the terms of the Current Advisory Agreement.\nBefore we acquire any property, the proposed transaction is be reviewed by the investment committee to ensure that, in its view, the transaction satisfies our investment criteria\nand is within our investment policies. Approval by the investment committee will generally be the final step in the property acquisition approval process, although the separate\napproval of our Board of Directors is required in certain circumstances, which are described below.\nOur Adviser and Administrator are headquartered in McLean, Virginia, a suburb of Washington D.C., and our Adviser also has offices in several other states. Refer to Part II,\nItem 7, “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Our Adviser and Administrator” of this Form 10-K for a detailed\ndiscussion on the fee structure of each of the Adviser and Administrator.\nAdviser Duties and Authority under the Current Advisory Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Current Advisory Agreement, our Adviser is required to present to us investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives as\nadopted by our Board of Directors. In performing its duties, our Adviser, either directly or indirectly by engaging an affiliate:\n• finds, evaluates, presents, and recommends to us a continuing series of real estate investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives;\n• provides advice to us and acts on our behalf with respect to the negotiation, acquisition, financing, refinancing, holding, leasing, and disposition of real estate\ninvestments;\n• enters into contracts to purchase real estate on our behalf in compliance with our investment procedures, objectives, and policies, subject to approval of our Board of\nDirectors, where required;\n• takes the actions and obtains the services necessary to effect the negotiation, acquisition, financing, refinancing holding, leasing, and disposition of real estate\ninvestments; and\n• provides day-to-day management of our real estate activities and other administrative services.\nOur Board of Directors has authorized our Adviser to make investments in any property on our behalf without the prior approval of our Board if the following conditions are\nsatisfied:\n• our Adviser has determined that the total cost of the property does not exceed its determined value; and\n• our Adviser has provided us with a representation that the property, in conjunction with our other investments and proposed investments, is reasonably expected to fulfill\nour investment objectives and policies as established by our Board of Directors then in effect.\nThe actual terms and conditions of transactions involving investments in properties shall be determined in the sole discretion of our Adviser, subject at all times to compliance\nwith the foregoing requirements. Some types of transactions, including the following, require the prior approval of our Board of Directors, including a majority of our\nindependent directors:\n• any acquisition which at the time of investment would have a cost exceeding 50% of our total assets; and\n• transactions that involve conflicts of interest with our Adviser (other than reimbursement of expenses in accordance with the Current Advisory Agreement).\nOur Adviser and Administrator also engage in other business ventures and, as a result, certain (but not all) of their resources are not dedicated exclusively to our business. For\nexample, our Adviser and Administrator also serve as the external adviser and administrator, respectively, to Gladstone Capital Corporation (“Gladstone Capital”) and\nGladstone Investment Corporation (“Gladstone Investment”), both publicly-traded business development companies affiliated with us, and Gladstone Commercial Corporation\n(“Gladstone Commercial”), a publicly-traded REIT affiliated with us. However, under the Current Advisory\n11\nTable of Content\nAgreement, our Adviser is required to devote sufficient resources to the administration of our affairs to discharge its obligations under the agreement. The Current Advisory\nAgreement is not assignable or transferable by either us or our Adviser without the consent of the other party, except that our Adviser may assign the Current Advisory\nAgreement to an affiliate for whom our Adviser agrees to guarantee its obligations to us.\nGladstone Securities\nGladstone Securities, LLC (“Gladstone Securities”) is a privately-held broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and insured by the Securities\nInvestor Protection Corporation. Gladstone Securities is an affiliate of ours, as its parent company is owned and controlled by David Gladstone, our chairman, chief executive\nofficer, and president. Mr. Gladstone also serves on the board of managers of Gladstone Securities. In addition, Michael LiCalsi, our General Counsel and Secretary, serves in\nseveral capacities for Gladstone Securities, serving as Chief Legal Officer, Secretary, and a member of its board of managers since 2010 and a managing principal since 2011.\nFinancing Arrangement Agreement\nOn April 11, 2017, we entered into an agreement with Gladstone Securities for it to act as our non-exclusive agent to assist us with arranging financing for our properties (the\n“Financing Arrangement Agreement”). Pursuant to the agreement, we pay Gladstone Securities a financing fee in connection with the services it provides to us for securing\nfinancing on our properties. Refer to Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Gladstone Securities,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for a\ndiscussion of the fees to be paid to Gladstone Securities pursuant to the Financing Arrangement Agreement.\nDealer-Manager Agreements\nIn connection with the continuous public offering of our Series B Preferred Stock (which was completed in March 2020), our Series C Preferred Stock (which was completed in\nDecember 2022), and our Series E Preferred Stock (which offering is ongoing), we entered into certain dealer-manager agreements with Gladstone Securities, whereby\nGladstone Securities served or serves, as appropriate, as our exclusive dealer-manager. Pursuant to each of these dealer-manager agreements, Gladstone Securities provided or\nprovides certain sales, promotional, and marketing services to us in connection with the offering of the respective stock. Refer to Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—\nGladstone Securities,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fees and commissions paid to Gladstone Securities pursuant to\neach of these dealer-manager agreements.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. Currently, services necessary for our business are provided by\nindividuals who are employees of our Adviser and our Administrator pursuant to the terms of the Current Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, respectively.\nEach of our executive officers is an employee or executive officer, or both, of each our Adviser and our Administrator. We expect that approximately 15 to 25 full-time\nemployees of our Adviser and our Administrator will spend substantial time on our matters during the 2024 calendar year. Our CFO, accounting team, and the employees of our\nAdviser who manage our assets and investments spend all of their time on our matters. To the extent that we acquire more investments, we anticipate that the number of\nemployees of our Adviser and our Administrator who devote time to our matters will increase and the number of our Adviser’s employees working out of local offices, if any,\nwhere we buy land will also increase.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Adviser and Administrator, collectively, had 69 full-time employees. A breakdown thereof is summarized by functional area in the table below:\nNumber of\nIndividuals Functional Area\n13 Executive Management\n35 Investment Management, Portfolio Management, and Due Diligence\n21 Administration, Accounting, Compliance, Human Resources, Legal, and Treasury\nThe Adviser and the Administrator aim to attract and retain capable advisory and administrative personnel, respectively, by offering competitive base salaries, benefits, and\nbonus structure and by providing employees with appropriate opportunities for professional development and growth.\nCompetition\nWe face competition for farmland acreage from many different entities, including, but not limited to, developers, municipalities, individual farmers, agriculture corporations,\ninstitutional investors, and others. Investment firms that we might compete\n12\nTable of Content\ndirectly against could include agricultural investment firms, such as Hancock Agricultural Investment Group, Prudential Agricultural Investments, and UBS AgriVest, LLC.\nThese firms engage in the acquisition, asset management, valuation, and disposition of farmland properties. Further competition may also come from other agricultural REITs,\nboth publicly-traded (e.g., Farmland Partners, Inc.) and privately-held (e.g., Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT, PBC); other agricultural-focused privately-held funds, such as\nAgIS Capital, LLC, and Homestead Capital; and various online farmland crowdfunding platforms (e.g., AcreTrader, FarmTogether).\nGovernment Regulations\nWe own, manage, acquire, and develop our properties in compliance with the laws and regulations of the United States, as well as state and local laws and regulations in the\njurisdictions where our properties are located, which may differ among jurisdictions. Developments related to public health emergencies, including laws and regulations\nimplemented by federal governmental authorities or state and local governmental authorities in jurisdictions where our properties are located in response to such public health\nemergencies, may impact our ability to operate our business, or those of our tenants, in the ordinary course, which may materially affect our results of operations for the year\nending December 31, 2024. Otherwise, we do not expect that compliance with the various laws and regulations we are subject to will have a material effect on our capital\nexpenditures, results of operations, or competitive position for the year ending December 31, 2024, as compared to prior periods.\nAdditionally, as an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, regulations, and ordinances and also could be liable to third\nparties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our properties. Environmental laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or\noperator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants, and the costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial. The\nliability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property’s value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure\nto remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage or adversely affect our ability to lease the real\nproperty or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.\nThese and other risks related to governmental regulation and environmental matters are described in more detail in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of this Form 10-K.\nOther Required Financial Information\nFor other required financial information related to our properties, concentrations, segments, and operations, refer to our consolidated financial statements, including the notes\nthereto, included within this Form 10-K.\nAvailable Information\nCopies of each of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements, and amendments, if any, to those reports\nfiled or furnished with the SEC, pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through our website at www.GladstoneLand.com. A request\nfor any of these reports may also be submitted to us by sending a written request addressed to Investor Relations, Gladstone Land Corporation, 1521 Westbranch Drive, Suite\n100, McLean, VA, 22102, or by calling our toll-free investor relations line at 1-866-366-5745. The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information\nstatements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.SEC.gov.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a number of significant risks and other factors relating to our structure and investment objectives. As a result, we cannot assure you\nthat we will achieve our investment objectives. You should consider carefully the following information as an investor and/or prospective investor in our securities. The risks\ndescribed below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impact our\nbusiness operations. If any of these risks occur, our business prospects, financial condition, or results of operations could suffer, the market price of our capital stock could\ndecline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our capital stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Operations\n13\nTable of Content\nOur real estate portfolio is concentrated across a limited number of states, which subjects us to an increased risk of significant loss if adverse weather, economic, or regulatory\nchanges or developments in the markets in which our properties are located occur.\nSince our current real estate profile is concentrated across a limited number of states, we are subject to adverse changes in the political or regulatory climate in those states or\nspecific counties where our properties are located that could adversely affect our real estate portfolio and our ability to lease properties. The geographic concentration of our\nportfolio could also cause us to be more susceptible to adverse weather, economic or regulatory changes, or developments in the markets in which our properties are located\nthan if we owned a more geographically-diverse portfolio, which could materially and adversely affect the value of our farms and our ability to lease our farms on favorable\nterms or at all.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and consummating additional suitable acquisitions that meet our investment criteria, which may impede our growth and negatively\naffect our results of operations.\nWe continue to actively seek and evaluate other farm properties for potential purchase, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to find and acquire properties\nthat meet our investment criteria. We expect that a significant number of our future tenants will be independent farming operations, about which there is generally little or no\npublicly available operating and financial information. As a result, we rely on our Adviser to perform due diligence investigations of these tenants, their operations, and their\nprospects. We may not learn all of the material information we need to know regarding these businesses through our investigations. As a result, it is possible that we could lease\nproperties to tenants that ultimately are unable to pay rent to us, which could adversely impact the amount available for distributions.\nInvestments in development farmland, or farmland planted with immature permanent crops rather than annual crops or mature permanent crops, may have inherent risks,\nincluding those relating to the longer period between development and commercial productivity for certain permanent crop development farms, the cost of development,\nprofitability of newly-developed farms, higher ongoing costs, and delayed development, all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nOn a limited basis, we have invested in certain properties requiring further development before reaching commercial productivity, such as the development of an almond\norchard, or in properties with immature permanent plantings. Such investments, and any future investments in property developments, involves risks that are different and, in\nmost cases, greater than the risks associated with our acquisition of fully-developed and commercially-productive farms. In addition to the risks associated with real estate\ninvestments in general, as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the risks associated with our development farms include, among other things:\n• significant time lag between commencement of development and commercial productivity for permanent crop development farms subjects us to greater risks due to\nfluctuations in the general economy, crop prices, and adverse weather conditions;\n• expenditure of money and time on development that may not be completed;\n• inability to achieve rental rates per acre at newly-developed farms to make the properties profitable;\n• higher than estimated costs, including labor and planting, irrigation or other related costs; and\n• possible delays in development due to a number of factors, including weather, labor disruptions, regulatory approvals, acts of terror or other acts of violence, or acts of\nGod (such as fires, earthquakes, or floods).\nAll of our properties undergoing development or planted with immature permanent crops are currently leased and earning income. However, with regard to future acquisitions of\nsuch properties, the time frame required for development and for the farms to become commercially productive means that we may not be able to lease the farms and, in turn,\ngenerate revenue with respect to such farms for several years. If any of the above events occur, the development of such farms may hinder our growth and have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow. In addition, new development farms, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately productive, typically require\nsubstantial time and attention from management.\nWe currently lease many of our properties to medium-sized, independent farming operations and agricultural businesses, which may have limited financial and personnel\nresources and, therefore, may be less stable than larger companies, which could impact our ability to generate rental revenue.\nWe expect to lease a significant number of our properties to medium-sized farming operations and related agricultural businesses, which will expose us to a number of risks\nspecifically related to these entities. For example, medium-sized agricultural businesses may be more likely than larger farming operations to have difficulty making lease\npayments when they experience adverse events. They also tend to experience significant fluctuations in their operating results and to be more vulnerable to competitors’ actions\nand market conditions, as well as general economic downturns. In addition, our target tenants may face intense competition, including competition from companies with greater\nfinancial resources, which could lead to price pressure on crops that could lower our tenants’ income.\n14\nTable of Content\nFurthermore, the success of a medium-sized business may also depend on the management talents and efforts of one or a small group of persons. The death, disability or\nresignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our tenant and, in turn, on us.\nOur Adviser has broad authority to make acquisitions and dispositions of properties, and there can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to continue to enter into\ndefinitive agreements to purchase properties, complete acquisitions, or dispose of properties on favorable terms. Our stockholders are unable to evaluate the economic merits of\nour investments or the terms of any dispositions of properties.\nOur Adviser has broad authority to make acquisitions and dispositions of properties. There can be no assurance that our Adviser will be able to continue to identify or negotiate\nacceptable terms for the acquisition or dispositions of properties or that we will be able to continue to acquire or dispose of such properties on favorable terms. We may compete\nwith other purchasers for attractive properties. Further factors that could cause us not to purchase one or more properties that initially meet our investment criteria include our\npotential inability to agree to definitive purchase terms with the prospective sellers and our discovery of problems with the properties in our due diligence investigations. Factors\nthat could cause us to be unable to dispose of a property on favorable terms include market conditions and competition. Any significant impediment to continue to identify and\nmake investments that fit into our investment criteria or dispose of investments during suitable market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue\nto generate cash flow and make distributions to our stockholders.\nOur cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay anticipated distributions, nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future,\nand we may need to borrow to make such distributions or may not be able to make such distributions at all.\nTo remain competitive with alternative investments, our distribution rate may exceed our cash available for distribution, including cash generated from operations. In the event\nthis happens, we intend to fund the difference out of any excess cash on hand or from borrowings under our revolving credit facility. If we do not have sufficient cash available\nfor distribution generated by our assets to pay the distributions set by our Board of Directors, or if cash available for distribution decreases in future periods, the market price of\nour common stock could decrease.\nAll distributions will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition, whether we are able to maintain our\nqualification as a REIT, and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. We may not be able to make distributions in the future. In addition,\nsome of our distributions may include a return of capital. To the extent that our Board of Directors approves distributions in excess of our then current and accumulated earnings\nand profits, these excess distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of your adjusted tax basis in your shares. A\nreturn of capital is not taxable, but it has the effect of reducing your adjusted tax basis in your investment. To the extent that distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of your\nshares, such excess will be treated for tax purposes as a gain from the sale or exchange of your shares. If we borrow to fund distributions, our future interest costs would\nincrease, thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been.\nSome of our tenants may be unable to pay rent, which could adversely affect our cash available to make distributions to our stockholders or otherwise impair the value of your\ninvestment.\nWe expect that single tenants will continue to occupy most of our farms, and, therefore, the success of our investments will continue to be materially dependent on the financial\nstability of these tenants. Some of our tenants may have been recently restructured using leverage acquired in a leveraged transaction, may otherwise be subject to significant\ndebt obligations, or may have been adversely impacted by public health emergencies. Tenants that are subject to significant debt obligations may be unable to make their rent\npayments if there are adverse changes in their businesses or in general economic conditions. Tenants that have been impacted adversely by public health emergencies may not\nbe able to make timely rental payments due to labor shortages, supply chain issues, or due to government-mandated lockdowns or other measures taken to address such public\nhealth emergencies. Tenants that have experienced leveraged restructurings or acquisitions will generally have substantially greater debt and substantially lower net worth than\nthey had prior to the leveraged transaction. In addition, the payment of rent and debt service may reduce the working capital available to leveraged entities and prevent them\nfrom devoting the resources necessary to remain competitive in their industries. In situations where management of the tenant will change after a transaction, it may be difficult\nfor our Adviser to determine with certainty the likelihood of the tenant’s business success and of it being able to pay rent throughout the lease term. These companies are more\nvulnerable to adverse conditions in their businesses or industries and economic conditions generally, as well as to increases in interest rates. In addition, these companies’\nrevenues and expenses may fluctuate according to the growing season, which may impact their ability to make regular lease payments.\n15\nTable of Content\nAny lease payment defaults by a tenant could adversely affect our cash flows and cause us to reduce the amount of distributions to stockholders. In the event of a default by a\ntenant, we may also experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property.\nSome of our tenants could be susceptible to bankruptcy, which would affect our ability to generate rents from them and therefore negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the risk of tenants being unable to make regular rent payments, certain of our tenants who may depend on debt and leverage could be especially susceptible to\nbankruptcy in the event that their cash flows are insufficient to satisfy their debt. Any bankruptcy of one of our tenants would result in a loss of lease payments to us, as well as\nan increase in our costs to carry the property.\nAdditionally, under bankruptcy law, a tenant who is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings has the option of continuing or terminating any unexpired lease. If a bankrupt tenant\nterminates a lease with us, any claim we might have for breach of the lease, excluding a claim against collateral securing the lease, would be treated as a general unsecured\nclaim. Our claim would likely be capped at the amount the tenant owed us for unpaid rent prior to the bankruptcy unrelated to the termination, plus the greater of one year of\nlease payments or 15% of the remaining lease payments payable under the lease, but in no case more than three years of lease payments. In addition, a bankruptcy court could\nre-characterize a net lease transaction as a secured lending transaction. If that were to occur, we would not be treated as the owner of the property, but might have additional\nrights as a secured creditor. This would mean our claim in bankruptcy court would only be for the amount we paid for the property, which could adversely impact our financial\ncondition.\nBecause we expect to continue to enter into some short-term leases, we may continue to be more susceptible to any decreases in prevailing market rental rates than would be the\ncase with long-term leases, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFor our properties that are farmed for annual row crops, we intend to primarily enter into leases with independent and corporate farming operations having terms generally\nranging from 3 to 10 years. As a result, we will be required to frequently re-lease our properties upon the expiration of our leases. This will subject our business to near term\nfluctuations in market rental rates, and we will be more susceptible to declines in market rental rates than we would be if we were to enter into longer-term leases. As a result,\nany decreases in the prevailing market rental rates in the geographic areas in which we own properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash\navailable for distribution to stockholders.\nOur investments in properties with longer-term leases (i.e., five years or more), could expose us to various risks, including interest rate risk and the risk of being unable to take\nadvantage of prevailing market rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nWhen entering into longer-term leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed, we intend to incorporate at least one of a variety of forms of rent escalators into the lease,\nincluding annual rent escalations or market reset periods. Annual rent escalations may be either a fixed amount each year or variable based on standard cost of living or inflation\nindices. In addition, some longer-term leases may require a regular survey of comparable land rents, with the rent owed per the lease being adjusted upward to reflect current\nmarket rents. If, in the future, we receive a significant portion of our revenues under longer-term leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed, subject to rent escalations\ndescribed above, we would be subject to interest rate risk in the event interest rates rise at a greater rate than any potential rent escalations. In addition, by entering into longer-\nterm leases, we would be subject to the risk that we would not be able to increase our rental rates if prevailing land values or rental rates have increased. Any inability to take\nadvantage of increases in prevailing land values or rental rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution to\nstockholders.\nOur investments in farms subject to leases with a participation rent component based on the annual gross revenues earned on the respective farm means that a portion of our\ncash flow is exposed to various risks, including risks related to declining crop prices and lower-than-average crop production, which could have a material adverse effect on\nthe amount of rent we can collect and, consequently, our cash flow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nWe own several farms subject to leases that include a participation rent component based on the annual gross revenues earned on the respective farm; however, the majority of\nthese leases also include a guarantee of a minimum amount of rental income that generally satisfies our investment return criteria. While we do not expect participation rents to\nmake up a significant portion of our overall leased portfolio, we intend to enter into additional leases with participation rent components. We anticipate that the majority of such\nleases will continue to have a floor that guarantees a minimum amount of rental income that generally satisfies our investment return criteria; however, such leases will still be\nimpacted by factors related to the success of the farmer-tenant’s harvest, including, but not limited to, declining crop prices and lower-than-average crop production, that may\nresult in us receiving less rent than anticipated or projected when entering into such leases. A reduction in the rent we receive could have a material adverse effect on our cash\nflow and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\n16\nTable of Content\nOur investments in farmland used for permanent crops have a higher risk profile than farmland used for annual row crops.\nSince our IPO, we have expanded our investment focus to include farms used for permanent crops, and we intend to continue to add to our investments in farmland used for\npermanent crops in the future. Permanent crops have plant structures (such as trees, vines, or bushes) that produce yearly crops without being replanted. Examples include\nalmonds, apples, blueberries, figs, pistachios, oranges, and table and wine grapes. Permanent crops generally involve more risk than annual row crops because permanent crops\nrequire more time and capital to plant and cultivate. As a result, permanent crops are generally more expensive to replace and more susceptible to disease and poor weather. If a\nfarmer loses a permanent crop to any natural disaster, such as drought, flooding, fire, or disease, there would generally be significant time and capital needed to return the land\nto commercial production because a tree, bush, or vine may take years to grow before bearing fruit.\nPermanent crop farmland also prevents the farmer from being able to rotate crop types to keep up with changing market conditions or changes in the weather or soil. If demand\nfor one type of permanent crop decreases, the permanent crop farmer cannot easily convert the farm to another type of crop because permanent crop farmland is dedicated to one\ncrop during the lifespan of the trees, bushes, or vines and therefore cannot easily be rotated to adapt to changing environmental or market conditions.\nIn addition, permanent crops, which can generally endure long periods of time from harvest to consumption, allow for global shipment and trade. As a result, permanent crops\nare usually less insulated from the global produce market volatility than annual row crops. This will generally provide for less price stability of the harvested crop and therefore\nless stability of the underlying land value for cropland producing permanent crops. As a result, permanent crop farms typically have a higher risk profile than annual row crop\nfarms.\nOur real estate investments will consist of agricultural properties that may be difficult to sell or re-lease upon tenant defaults or early lease terminations, either of which would\nadversely affect returns to stockholders.\nWe intend to focus our investments on agricultural properties. These types of properties are relatively illiquid compared to other types of real estate and financial assets. This\nilliquidity could limit our ability to quickly dispose of properties in response to changes in economic or other conditions. With these kinds of properties, if the current lease is\nterminated or not renewed, we may be required to renovate the property to the extent we have buildings on the property, or to make rent concessions to lease the property to\nanother tenant or sell the property. In addition, in the event we are forced to sell the property, we may have difficulty finding qualified purchasers. These and other limitations\nmay affect our ability to sell or re-lease properties without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders.\nIf we sell properties and provide financing to purchasers, defaults by the purchasers would decrease our cash flows and limit our ability to make distributions.\nIn some instances, we may sell our properties by providing financing to purchasers who may then also operate the farm. When we provide financing to purchasers, we may bear\nthe risk that the purchaser may default, which could negatively impact our liquidity and thus our ability to either distribute the proceeds from the sale to our stockholders or\nreinvest the sale proceeds in other property acquisitions.\nIf our properties do not have access to adequate water supplies, it could harm our ability to lease the properties for farming, thereby adversely affecting our ability to generate\nreturns on our properties.\nTo lease the cropland that we intend to acquire, these properties will require access to sufficient water to make them suitable for farming. Additionally, the ability of our current\ntenants to make their rental payments is dependent upon sufficient access to water. Although we expect to acquire properties with sufficient water access, should the need arise\nfor additional wells from which to obtain water, we likely would be required to obtain permits prior to drilling such wells. Permits for drilling water wells are required by state\nand county regulations, and such permits may be difficult to obtain due to the limited supply of water in areas where we expect to acquire properties, such as the farming regions\nof California. Similarly, our properties may be subject to governmental regulations relating to the quality and disposition of rainwater runoff or other water to be used for\nirrigation. In such case, we could incur costs necessary to retain this water. If we are unable to obtain or maintain sufficient water supply for our properties, our ability to lease\nthem for farming would be seriously impaired, which would have a material adverse impact on the value of our assets and our results of operations. If, in the future, we invest in\nfarmland that depends upon rain water rather than local water access, our tenants on that farmland may be susceptible to extended droughts, and any failure on the part of such\ntenants to procure adequate drought insurance would impact the ability of such tenants to make rental payments, which would have a material adverse impact on our ability to\ngenerate returns on our properties.\nOur agricultural properties are subject to adverse weather conditions, seasonal variability, crop disease and other contaminants, which may affect our tenants’ ability to pay\nrent and thereby have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\n17\nTable of Content\nFresh produce, including produce used in canning and other packaged food operations, is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and\ntemperature extremes, which are common but difficult to predict. Because fresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after\nharvest, unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. Seasonal factors, including supply and consumer demand, may also have an effect on the\ncrops grown by our tenants. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Further, certain of our properties are reliant upon groundwater, as they are\nnot located within any state or federal water districts and, thus, are not limited by any government-regulated restrictions.\nFresh produce is also vulnerable to crop disease, pests, and other contaminants. Damages to tenants’ crops from crop disease and pests may vary in severity and effect,\ndepending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and environmental conditions. The costs to control these infestations\nvary depending on the severity of the damage and the extent of the plantings affected. These infestations can increase costs and decrease revenues of our tenants. Tenants may\nalso incur losses from product recalls due to other contaminants that may cause food borne illness. It is difficult to predict the occurrence or severity of such product recalls as\nwell as the impact of these upon our tenants. Although we do not expect that a significant portion of our rental payments will be based on the quality of our tenants’ harvests,\nany of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our tenants’ ability to pay rent to us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make\ndistributions to our stockholders.\nAs permanent crops produce yearly crops without being replanted, they are more expensive to replace and more susceptible to disease and poor weather than annual row crops.\nIf a farmer loses a permanent crop to any natural disaster, such as drought, flooding, fire or disease, there would generally be significant time and capital needed to return the\nland to production because a tree or vine may take years to grow before bearing fruit. Permanent crop farmland also prevents the farmer from being able to rotate crop types to\nkeep up with changing market conditions or changes to the weather or soil. If demand for one type of permanent crop decreases, the permanent crop farmer cannot easily convert\nthe farm to another type of crop because permanent crop farmland is dedicated to one crop during the lifespan of the trees or vines and therefore cannot easily be rotated to adapt\nto changing environmental or market conditions. As a result, the risks associated with weather conditions, seasonal variability, crop disease and other contaminants are\nmagnified in the case of permanent crops.\nOur operating results and the value of our properties may be impacted by future climate changes, adversely impacting the value of our properties and our ability to generate\nrental revenue.\nIn addition to the general risks that adverse weather conditions will pose for the tenants of our properties and their subsequent ability to comply with the terms of their leases, the\nvalue of our properties will potentially be subject to risks associated with long-term effects of climate change. Many climatologists predict increases in average temperatures,\nmore extreme temperatures and increases in volatile weather over time. The effects of climate change may be more significant along coastlines, such as in the California coastal\nareas where we partially focus our acquisition efforts, due to rising sea levels resulting from the melting of polar ice caps, which could result in increased risk of coastal erosion,\nflooding, degradation in the availability and quality of groundwater aquifers, and expanding agricultural weed and pest populations. As a result, the effects of climate change\ncould make our properties less suitable for farming or other alternative uses, which could adversely impact the value of our properties, our ability to generate rental revenue\nfrom leasing our properties and our cash available for distribution to stockholders. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of, or\navailability of, property insurance on terms we find acceptable and increasing the cost of energy at our properties.\nBecause we must distribute a substantial portion of our net income to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will be largely dependent on third-party sources of capital to\nfund our future capital needs.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income each year, excluding net capital gains. Because of\nthis distribution requirement, it is not likely that we will be able to fund a significant portion of our future capital needs, including property acquisitions, from retained earnings.\nTherefore, we may acquire additional capital from the issuance of securities senior to our common shares, including borrowings or other indebtedness, preferred shares (such as\nour Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Term Preferred Stock, or Series E Preferred Stock), or the issuance of other securities. This capital may not be\navailable on favorable terms or at all. Our access to additional capital depends on a number of things, including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current\nand potential future earnings.\nTo the extent we issue debt securities, other instruments of indebtedness, or additional preferred stock or borrow additional money from banks or other financial institutions, we\nwill be additionally exposed to risks associated with leverage, including increased risk of loss. If we issue additional preferred securities that rank senior to our common shares\nin our capital structure, the holders of such preferred securities may have separate voting rights and other rights, preferences, or privileges, economic and otherwise, more\nfavorable than those of our common shares and our currently-designated preferred securities, and the issuance of such preferred securities could have the effect of delaying,\ndeferring, or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for common stockholders.\n18\nTable of Content\nAny inability to access additional financing on terms that are favorable to us may adversely affect our ability to grow and our business generally.\nWe may not be able to raise sufficient capital or borrow money in sufficient amounts or on sufficiently favorable terms necessary to attain the optimal degree of leverage to\noperate our business, which may have an adverse effect on our operations and ability to pay distributions.\nOur ability to raise additional capital in the markets may be limited due to market conditions and applicable SEC regulations. Our business and acquisition strategies rely heavily\non borrowing funds, so that we may make more investments than would otherwise be possible to maximize potential returns to stockholders. We may borrow on a secured or\nunsecured basis. Our charter and bylaws do not impose any limitation on our borrowing. Our ability to achieve our investment objectives will be affected by our ability to\nborrow money in sufficient amounts and on favorable terms, which may result in us becoming highly leveraged. We expect that we will borrow money that will be secured by\nour properties and that these financing arrangements will contain customary covenants such as those that limit our ability, without the prior consent of the lender, to further\nmortgage the applicable property or to discontinue insurance coverage. In addition, any credit facility we might enter into is likely to contain certain customary restrictions,\nrequirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, and will specify debt ratios that we will be required to maintain. Accordingly, we may be unable to\nobtain the degree of leverage that we believe to be optimal, which may cause us to have less cash for distributions to stockholders. Our use of leverage could also make us more\nvulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy generally and a significant increase in the ratio of our indebtedness to our assets may have an adverse effect on the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nOur income from operations may not be enough to cover our debt service obligations, which may affect distributions to stockholders or cause us to incur losses.\nIf the income generated by our properties and other assets fails to cover our debt service, we could be forced to reduce or eliminate distributions to our stockholders and may\nexperience losses. Some of our debt financing arrangements may require us to make lump-sum, or balloon, payments at maturity. If our income from operations does not cover\na balloon payment, our ability to make the balloon payment at maturity could depend upon our ability to obtain additional financing or to sell the financed property. At the time\nthe balloon payment is due, we may not be able to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original loan or sell the property at a price sufficient to make the\nballoon payment, which would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have secured borrowings, which would have a risk of loss of the property securing such loan upon foreclosure.\nWe have multiple borrowing facilities in place, and our total borrowings are secured by the majority of the farms we own. If we are unable to make our debt payments as\nrequired, either under our current credit facilities or any future facilities, a lender could foreclose on certain of the properties securing its loan. This could cause us to lose part or\nall of our investment in the property, which in turn could cause the value of our common stock, any of our currently-designated preferred securities, or the distributions to our\nstockholders to be reduced or delayed.\nAs we consider additional debt financing from third-party lenders, our assets may become highly leveraged, which may result in losses.\nThere is no limitation imposed by our charter or bylaws on our borrowings. An increased amount of leverage may expose us to cash flow problems if rental income decreases.\nUnder those circumstances, in order to pay our debt obligations, including distribution and dividend payments to stockholders, we might be required to sell properties at a loss\nor be unable to make distributions or decrease distributions to our stockholders. A failure to pay amounts due to lenders or redeem shares of our Series D Term Preferred Stock\nunder the mandatory redemption requirement may result in a default on our obligations and result in certain penalties, such as increased interest rates. Additionally, our degree\nof leverage could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing and may have an adverse effect on the public market price of shares of our publicly-traded common\nstock or currently-designated preferred securities.\nWe face a risk from the fact that certain of our properties are cross-collateralized.\nThe mortgages on certain of our properties are cross-collateralized. To the extent that any of the properties in which we have an interest are cross-collateralized, any default by\nthe property owner subsidiary under the mortgage note relating to the one property will result in a default under the financing arrangements relating to any other property that\nalso provides security for that mortgage note or is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with such mortgage note. Such a default may adversely affect our financial condition,\nresults of operations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.\nCompetition for the acquisition of agricultural real estate may impede our ability to make acquisitions, increase the cost of these acquisitions or decrease or prevent increases\nin the occupancy and rental rates of our current properties.\n19\nTable of Content\nWe will compete for the acquisition of properties with many other entities engaged in agricultural and real estate investment activities, including corporate agriculture\ncompanies, financial institutions, institutional pension funds, real estate companies, private equity funds and private real estate investors. These competitors may prevent us\nfrom acquiring desirable properties or may cause an increase in the price we must pay for real estate. Our competitors may have greater resources than we do and may be\nwilling to pay more for certain assets or may have a more compatible operating philosophy with our acquisition targets. In particular, larger institutions may enjoy significant\ncompetitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Our competitors may also adopt transaction structures\nsimilar to, or more favorable than ours, offering rental rates below current market rates or below rates we currently charge our tenants, which would decrease our competitive\nadvantage in offering flexible transaction terms. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase, resulting\nin increased demand and increased prices paid for these properties. If we pay higher prices for properties, our profitability may decrease, and you may experience a lower return\non your investment. Increased competition for properties may also preclude us from acquiring those properties that would generate attractive returns to us, as well as prevent us\nfrom achieving diversification by geography and crop type, having a material adverse effect on our results of operations and available cash for distributions to stockholders.\nWe operate as a holding company dependent upon the assets and operations of our subsidiaries, and because of our structure, we may not be able to generate the funds\nnecessary to make distributions on our common stock.\nWe generally operate as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through our Operating Partnership, which in turn is a holding company conducting its\nbusiness through its subsidiaries. These subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and are our only source of income. Accordingly, we are dependent on cash flows and\npayments of funds to us by our subsidiaries as distributions, loans, advances, leases or other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make\ndistributions on our common stock. Our subsidiaries’ ability to pay such distributions and/or make such loans, advances, leases or other payments may be restricted by, among\nother things, applicable laws and regulations, current and future debt agreements and management agreements into which our subsidiaries may enter, which may impair our\nability to make cash payments on our common stock. In addition, such agreements may prohibit or limit the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer any of their property or assets\nto us, any of our other subsidiaries or to third parties. Our future indebtedness or our subsidiaries’ future indebtedness may also include restrictions with similar effects.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company, stockholders’ claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for\nborrowed money) of our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, claims of our stockholders will be\nsatisfied only after all of our and our operating partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nSome state laws prohibit or restrict the ownership of agricultural land by business entities, which could impede the growth of our portfolio and our ability to diversify\ngeographically.\nCertain states, including Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Kansas have laws that prohibit or restrict to varying degrees the\nownership of agricultural land by corporations or business entities like us. Additional states may, in the future, pass similar or more restrictive laws, and we may not be legally\npermitted, or it may become overly burdensome or expensive, to acquire properties in these states, which could impede the growth of our portfolio and our ability to diversify\ngeographically in states that might otherwise have attractive investment opportunities.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may have adverse consequences.\nAs we expand and diversify our geographic portfolio, we may acquire properties located in new markets, exposing us to risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or\nunderstanding of the local market. This includes the availability and identity of quality tenant farmers, forging new business relationships in the area and unfamiliarity with\nlocal government requirements and procedures. Furthermore, the evaluation and negotiation of a potential expansion into new markets would divert management time and other\nresources. As a result, we may have difficulties executing our business strategy in these new markets, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and\nability to make distributions to stockholders.\nWe may not ultimately be able to sell our agricultural real estate to developers in connection with the conversion of such properties to urban or suburban uses, especially in\nlight of the current uncertain market for real estate development.\nOur business plan in part contemplates purchasing agricultural real property that we believe is located in the path of urban and suburban growth and ultimately will increase in\nvalue over the long term as a result. Pending the sale of such real property to developers for conversion to urban, suburban and other more intensive uses, such as residential or\ncommercial development, we intend to lease the property for agricultural uses, particularly farming. Urban and suburban development is subject to a number of uncertainties,\nincluding land zoning and environmental issues, infrastructure development and demand. These uncertainties are particularly pronounced in light of the current economic\nenvironment, in which the pace of future development is unclear. Although the current development market contains uncertainties, these uncertainties may be more acute over\ntime, since we do\n20\nTable of Content\nnot intend to acquire properties that are expected to be converted to urban or suburban uses in the near term. As a result, there can be no guarantee that increased development\nwill actually occur and that we will be able to sell any of the properties that we own or acquire in the future for such conversion. Our inability to sell these properties in the future\nat an appreciated value for conversion to urban or suburban uses could result in a reduced return on your investment.\nLiability for uninsured or underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition.\nLosses from disaster-type occurrences, such as wars, earthquakes and weather-related disasters, may be either uninsurable or not insurable on economically viable terms. Should\nan uninsured loss occur, we could lose our capital investment or anticipated profits and cash flows from one or more properties. If any such loss is insured, we may be required\nto pay a significant deductible on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to issue reimbursement. Further, the amount of losses may exceed our\ncoverage, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow.\nPotential liability for environmental matters could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe intend to purchase agricultural properties and will be subject to the risk of liabilities under federal, state and local environmental laws. Some of these laws could subject us\nto:\n• responsibility and liability for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released on our properties, which may include herbicides and pesticides,\ngenerally without regard to our knowledge of or responsibility for the presence of the contaminants;\n• liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at disposal facilities for persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of these\nsubstances; and\n• potential liability for claims by third parties for damages resulting from environmental contaminants.\nWe will generally include provisions in our leases making tenants responsible for all environmental liabilities and for compliance with environmental regulations, and we will\nseek to require tenants to reimburse us for damages or costs for which we have been found liable. However, these provisions will not eliminate our statutory liability or preclude\nthird-party claims against us. Even if we were to have a legal claim against a tenant to enable us to recover any amounts we are required to pay, there are no assurances that we\nwould be able to collect any money from the tenant. Our costs of investigation, remediation or removal of hazardous substances may be substantial. In addition, the presence of\nhazardous substances on one of our properties, or the failure to properly remediate a contaminated property, could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease the property or to\nborrow using the property as collateral. Additionally, we could become subject to new, stricter environmental regulations, which could diminish the utility of our properties and\nhave a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf our tenants fail to comply with applicable labor regulations, it could have an adverse effect on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nState, county, and federal governments have also implemented a number of regulations governing labor practices used in connection with farming operations. For example,\nthese regulations seek to provide for minimum wages and minimum and maximum work hours, as well as to restrict the hiring of illegal immigrants. If one of our tenants is\naccused of violating, or found to have violated such regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on the tenant’s operating results, which could adversely affect its ability\nto make its rental payments to us and, in turn, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe presence of endangered or threatened species on or near our acquired farmland could restrict the activities of our agricultural tenants, which could in turn have a material\nadverse impact on the value of our assets and our results of operations.\nFederal, state, and local laws and regulations intended to protect threatened or endangered species could restrict certain activities on our farmland. The size of any area subject to\nrestriction would vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, and there can be no assurance that such federal, state, and local laws will\nnot become more restrictive over time. If portions of our farmland are deemed to be part of or bordering habitats for such endangered or threatened species that could be\ndisturbed by the agricultural activities of our tenants, it could impair the ability of the land to be used for farming, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on the\nvalue of our assets and our results of operations.\nWe may be required to permit the owners of the mineral rights to our properties to enter and occupy parts of the properties for the purposes of drilling and operating oil or gas\nwells, which could adversely impact the rental value of our properties.\nAlthough we will own the surface rights to the properties that we acquire, other persons may own the rights to any minerals, such as oil and natural gas, that may be located\nunder the surfaces of these properties. Under agreements with any such mineral rights owners, we expect that we would be required to permit third parties to enter our properties\nfor the purpose of drilling and operating oil or gas wells on the premises. We will also be required to set aside a reasonable portion of the surface area of our properties to\naccommodate these oil and gas operations. The devotion of a portion of our properties to these oil and gas\n21\nTable of Content\noperations would reduce the amount of the surface available for farming or farm-related uses, which could adversely impact the rents that we receive from leasing these\nproperties.\nInterest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may experience interest rate volatility in connection with mortgage loans on our properties or other variable-rate debt that we may obtain from time to time, such as our\nexisting lines of credit, which are variable. Although we seek to mitigate this risk by structuring such provisions to contain a maximum interest rate or escalation rate, as\napplicable, and obtain interest rate swaps on certain borrowings to limit our exposure to interest rate risk, these features do not eliminate this risk. We are also exposed to the\neffects of interest rate changes as a result of holding cash and cash equivalents in short-term, interest-bearing investments. Additionally, increases in interest rates, or reduced\naccess to credit markets due, among other things, to more stringent lending requirements or a high level of leverage, may make it difficult for us to refinance our mortgage debt\nas it matures or limit the availability of mortgage debt, thereby limiting our acquisition and/or refinancing activities. Even in the event that we are able to secure mortgage debt\non, or otherwise finance our mortgage debt, due to increased costs associated with securing financing and other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to refinance the\nentire mortgage debt as it matures or be subject to unfavorable terms (such as higher loan fees, interest rates, and periodic payments) if we do refinance the mortgage debt. A\nsignificant change in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWhile the U.S. Federal Reserve increased the federal funds rate 11 times from March 2022 through July 2023, they have held the federal funds rate flat since then. Future\ndecisions on the federal funds rate will depend on a variety of key economic indicators, including inflation and the unemployment rate, among others. Any future increases may\ncause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise even further, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. Any prolonged adverse\neconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the impact future actions by regulators or government bodies, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, will have on real estate debt markets, the market value of\nour capital stock or on our business, and any such actions may negatively impact us.\nRegulators and U.S. government bodies have a major impact on our business. The U.S. Federal Reserve is a major participant in, and its actions significantly impact, the real\nestate debt markets. The Federal Reserve has kept the federal funds rate flat since July 2023, and there can be no assurance if or when any reductions will be announced. Partly\ndue to increases in the federal funds rate prior to July 2023 and the uncertainty over future actions of the Federal Reserve, borrowing costs remain high. Should the Federal\nReserve continue to keep the federal funds rate flat for a prolonged period of time, or should it announce further increases, this may cause interest rates and borrowing costs to\nremain high or rise even further, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms and the market value of our capital stock. This may\nresult in future acquisitions by us generating lower overall economic returns and increasing the costs associated with refinancing current debt, which could potentially reduce\nfuture cash flow available for distributions. It is difficult to predict future legislation, regulation, and executive actions, and we cannot predict or control the impact future actions\nby regulators or government bodies, such as the Federal Reserve, will have on our business.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations or the operations of businesses in which we invest, a\ncompromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition,\nand operating results.\nIn the normal course of business, we and our service providers collect and retain certain personal information provided by our tenants, employees of our Administrator and\nAdviser, and vendors. We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business. Despite careful security and controls design,\nimplementation, updating, and independent third-party verification, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to\ncybersecurity incidents. A cybersecurity incident is defined by the SEC as an unauthorized occurrence, or a series of related unauthorized occurrences, on or conducted through\nour information systems that jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources or any information residing therein. A cybersecurity incident\nmay be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems or those of our third-party providers for\npurposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. The result of a cybersecurity incident may include\ndisrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation, and\ndamage to our business relationships. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided to us by\nthird-party service providers. In addition, cybersecurity threats such as those noted above have increased in recent years in part due to increasingly numerous and sophisticated\nmalicious cyber actors. We have implemented processes, procedures, and internal controls to help prevent, detect, and mitigate cybersecurity threats and cyber intrusions, but\nthese measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a threat of a cyber-incident,\n22\nTable of Content\ndo not guarantee that a cyber-incident will not occur, will be timely detected, or that our financial results, operations, or confidential information will not be negatively impacted\nby such an incident. The development and maintenance of these measures are also costly and require ongoing monitoring, testing, and updating as technologies and processes\nchange and efforts to overcome cybersecurity measures become increasingly sophisticated.\nOur business may be adversely affected by public health emergencies.\nAny public health emergency, including any outbreak of COVID-19, SARS, H1N1/09 flu, avian flu, other coronavirus, Ebola or other existing or new epidemic diseases, or the\nthreat thereof, could have a significant adverse impact on us and could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our investment objectives.\nThe extent of the impact of any public health emergency on our operational and financial performance will depend on many factors, including the duration and scope of such\npublic health emergency, the extent of any related travel advisories and restrictions implemented, the impact of such public health emergencies on overall supply and demand,\ngoods and services, investor liquidity, consumer confidence and levels of economic activity, and the extent of its disruption to important global, regional, and local supply\nchains and economic markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The effects of a public health emergency may disrupt the operations of our tenant-\nfarmers and pose the risk that they may be prevented from conducting normal business activities for an unknown period of time, including shutdowns that may be requested or\nmandated by governmental authorities. We cannot accurately estimate the impact that a public health threat could have on our farmland portfolio, but it could disrupt the\nbusinesses of our tenant-farmers and impact their ability to make lease payments to us, including under modified lease terms allowing for deferred rent, thereby decreasing the\noverall value of our leasehold interests in the properties, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFurther, our operations may be significantly impacted, or even temporarily or permanently halted, as a result of government shelter-in-place measures, vaccine mandates,\nvoluntary and precautionary restrictions on travel or meetings, paused or reversed reopening orders, and other factors related to a public health emergency, including its\npotential adverse impact on the health of our Adviser’s and Administrator’s personnel. As a result, there is a risk that this continuing crisis could adversely impact our ability to\nsource, manage, and divest investments and the Company’s ability to achieve its investment objectives, all of which could result in significant losses to us and could impact our\nability to make interest and distribution payments to lenders and stockholders, respectively, including their respective amounts.\nRisks Associated With Our Use of an Adviser to Manage Our Business\nWe are dependent upon our key management personnel for our future success, particularly David Gladstone, Terry Lee Brubaker, Bill Reiman, Lewis Parrish, and Jay\nBeckhorn.\nWe have no employees and are therefore dependent on the senior management and other key management members who are employed by our Adviser or Administrator, as\napplicable, to carry out our business and investment strategies. Our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of our senior\nmanagement team, particularly David Gladstone, our chairman, chief executive officer and president; Terry Lee Brubaker, our chief operating officer; Bill Reiman, our\nExecutive Vice President; and Lewis Parrish, our chief financial officer and assistant treasurer. Mr. Gladstone also serves as the chief executive officer of our Adviser and our\nAdministrator, and Mr. Brubaker is also an executive officer of our Adviser and our Administrator. The departure of any of our executive officers or key personnel of our\nAdviser or Administrator, as applicable, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business strategy and to achieve our investment objectives.\nOur success will continue to depend on the performance of our Adviser and if our Adviser makes inadvisable investment or management decisions, our operations could be\nmaterially adversely impacted.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objectives and to pay distributions to our stockholders is substantially dependent upon the performance of our Adviser in evaluating\npotential investments, selecting and negotiating property purchases and dispositions on our behalf, selecting tenants and borrowers, setting lease terms and determining\nfinancing arrangements. You will have no opportunity to evaluate the terms of transactions or other economic or financial data concerning our investments. You must rely\nentirely on the analytical and management abilities of our Adviser and the oversight of our Board of Directors. If our Adviser or our Board of Directors makes inadvisable\ninvestment or management decisions, our operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe may have conflicts of interest with our Adviser and other affiliates, which could result in investment decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur Adviser manages our real estate portfolio and locates, evaluates, recommends and negotiates the acquisition of our real estate investments and mortgage loans. At the same\ntime, our Advisory Agreement permits our Adviser to conduct other\n23\nTable of Content\ncommercial activities and to provide management and advisory services to other entities, including, but not limited to, Gladstone Commercial, Gladstone Capital, and Gladstone\nInvestment, each of which is affiliated with us. Each of our executive officers, other than Mr. Parrish, is also an executive officer of Gladstone Commercial, which actively\nmakes real estate investments, and Gladstone Capital and Gladstone Investment, which actively make loans to and invest in small- and medium-sized companies. As a result, we\nmay, from time to time, have conflicts of interest with our Adviser in its management of our business and that of Gladstone Commercial, Gladstone Investment, or Gladstone\nCapital, which may arise primarily from the involvement of our Adviser, Gladstone Commercial, Gladstone Capital, Gladstone Investment, and their affiliates in other activities\nthat may conflict with our business. Examples of these potential conflicts include:\n• our Adviser may realize substantial compensation on account of its activities on our behalf and may be motivated to approve acquisitions solely on the basis of\nincreasing its compensation from us;\n• our agreements with our Adviser are not arm’s-length agreements, which could result in terms in those agreements that are less favorable than we could obtain from\nindependent third parties;\n• we may experience competition with our affiliates for potential financing transactions; and\n• our Adviser and other affiliates, such as Gladstone Commercial, Gladstone Capital, and Gladstone Investment could compete for the time and services of our officers and\ndirectors and reduce the amount of time they are able to devote to management of our business.\nThese and other conflicts of interest between us and our Adviser could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business and the selection or management of our\nreal estate investments.\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our Adviser’s ability to effectively manage our future growth.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objectives will depend on our ability to sustain continued growth, which will, in turn, depend on our Adviser’s ability to find, select and\nnegotiate property purchases and net leases that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our Adviser’s marketing\ncapabilities, management of the investment process, ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services and our access to financing sources on acceptable terms. As we\ngrow, our Adviser may be required to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Our Adviser’s failure to effectively manage our future growth could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Adviser is not obligated to provide a waiver of the incentive fee, which could negatively impact our earnings and our ability to maintain our current level of, or increase,\ndistributions to our stockholders.\nThe Advisory Agreement contemplates a quarterly incentive fee based on our funds from operation (“FFO”). Our Adviser has the ability to issue a full or partial waiver of the\nincentive fee for current and future periods; however, our Adviser is not required to issue any waiver. Any waiver issued by our Adviser is an unconditional and irrevocable\nwaiver. If our Adviser does not issue this waiver in future quarters, it could negatively impact our earnings and may compromise our ability to maintain our current level of, or\nincrease, distributions to our stockholders.\nWe may be obligated to pay our Adviser quarterly incentive compensation even if we incur a net loss during a particular quarter.\nThe Advisory Agreement entitles our Adviser to incentive compensation based on our FFO, which rewards our Adviser if our quarterly pre-incentive fee FFO exceeds 1.75%\n(7.0% annualized) of our total adjusted common equity. Our pre-incentive fee FFO for a particular quarter for incentive compensation purposes excludes the effect of any\nunrealized gains, losses, or other items during that quarter that do not affect realized net income, even if these adjustments result in a net loss on our statement of operations for\nthat quarter. Thus, we may be required to pay our Adviser incentive compensation for a fiscal quarter even if we incur a net loss for that quarter as determined in accordance\nwith U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nRisks Associated With Ownership of Our Common Stock and OP Units and Our Tax Status\nCertain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and under Maryland law may prohibit or restrict attempts by our stockholders to change our management and hinder\nefforts to effect a change of control of us, and the market price of our common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to acquire, or attempt to acquire, control of our company, even if a change in control\nwas considered favorable by you and other stockholders. For example:\n• Our articles of incorporation prohibit ownership of more than 3.3% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock by one person, except for certain qualified institutional\ninvestors, which are limited to holding 9.8% of our common stock. As of December 31, 2023, David Gladstone, our chairman, chief executive officer, and president, and\npursuant to an exception approved by our Board of Directors and in compliance with our charter, owned, directly or indirectly,\n24\nTable of Content\nincluding through certain foundations and trusts, approximately 7.0% of our common stock, and the Gladstone Future Trust, for the benefit of Mr. Gladstone’s children,\nowned approximately 1.9% of our common stock. The ownership restriction may discourage a change of control and may deter individuals or entities from making\ntender offers for our capital stock, which offers might otherwise be financially attractive to our stockholders or which might cause a change in our management.\n• Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with the term of the directors in each class expiring every third year. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the\nsuccessors to the class of directors whose term expires at such meeting will be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the\nthird year following the year of their election. After election, a director may only be removed by our stockholders for cause. Election of directors for staggered terms\nwith limited rights to remove directors makes it more difficult for a hostile bidder to acquire control of us. The existence of this provision may negatively impact the price\nof our securities and may discourage third-party bids to acquire our securities. This provision may reduce any premiums paid to stockholders in a change in control\ntransaction.\n• The Control Share Acquisition Act provides that “control shares” of a Maryland corporation acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the\nextent approved by the corporation’s disinterested stockholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares of stock owned by interested\nstockholders, that is, by the acquirer, by officers or by directors who are employees of the corporation, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter. “Control\nshares” are voting shares of stock that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of three increasing ranges of voting power. The\nControl Share Acquisition does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (b) to\nacquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any\nand all acquisitions of our common stock by David Gladstone or any of his affiliates. This statute could have the effect of discouraging offers from third parties to\nacquire us and increasing the difficulty of successfully completing this type of offer by anyone other than Mr. Gladstone or any of his affiliates.\n• Certain provisions of Maryland law applicable to us prohibit business combinations with:\n◦ any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our common stock, referred to as an “interested stockholder;”\n◦ an affiliate of ours who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was an interested stockholder; or\n◦ an affiliate of an interested stockholder.\nThese prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. Thereafter, any business combination with\nthe interested stockholder must be recommended by our Board and approved by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our\noutstanding shares of common stock and two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our common stock other than shares held by the interested stockholder. These\nrequirements could have the effect of inhibiting a change in control even if a change in control were in our stockholders’ interest. These provisions of Maryland law do not\napply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by our Board of Directors prior to the time that someone becomes an interested stockholder.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited.\nMaryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to\nbe advisable and in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. In addition, our charter\n(i) eliminates our directors’ and officers’ liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in\nmoney, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and that is material to the cause of action and (ii) requires us to indemnify\ndirectors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. As a result, our stockholders and\nwe may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs\nincurred by our directors and officers.\nWe may enter into tax protection agreements in the future in connection with the issuance of OP Units to acquire additional properties, which could limit our ability to sell or\notherwise dispose of certain properties.\nOur Operating Partnership may enter into tax protection agreements in connection with issuing OP Units to acquire additional properties which could provide that if we dispose\nof any interest in the protected acquired property prior to a certain time, we will indemnify the other party for its tax liabilities attributable to the built-in gain that exists with\nrespect to such property. Therefore, although it may be in our stockholders’ best interests that we sell one of these properties, it may be economically\n25\nTable of Content\nprohibitive for us to do so if we are a party to such a tax protection agreement. While we do not currently have any of these tax protection agreements in place currently, we may\nenter into such agreements in the future.\nOur redemption of OP Units could result in the issuance of a large number of new shares of our common stock and/or force us to expend significant cash, which may limit our\nfunds necessary to make distributions on our common stock.\nFollowing any contractual lock-up provisions, including the one-year mandatory holding period, a non-controlling limited partner of our Operating Partnership may require us\nto redeem the OP Units it holds. At our election, we may satisfy the redemption through either a cash redemption, the issuance of shares of our common stock on a one-for-one\nbasis, or a combination of the two. However, the limited partners’ redemption right may not be exercised if and to the extent that the delivery of the shares upon such exercise\nwould result in any person violating the ownership and transfer restrictions set forth in our charter. If a large number of OP Units were redeemed, it could result in the issuance\nof a large number of new shares of our common stock, which could dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership. Alternatively, if we were to redeem a large number of OP Units\nfor cash, we may be required to expend significant amounts to pay the redemption price, which may limit our funds necessary to make distributions on our common stock.\nFurther, if we do not have sufficient cash on hand at the time the OP Units are tendered for redemption, we may be forced to sell additional shares of our common stock in order\nto raise cash, which could cause dilution to our existing stockholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter grants our Board of Directors the right to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock, increase or decrease the authorized number of shares and\nestablish the preference and rights of any preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nUnder our charter, we currently have authority to issue shares of both common stock and preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority, without a stockholders’ vote,\nto classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock, including common stock, into preferred stock (or vice versa), to increase or decrease the authorized number of shares of\ncommon stock and preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock or other class or series of shares to be issued. Because our Board of\nDirectors has the power to establish the preferences and rights of additional classes or series of stock without a stockholders’ vote, our Board of Directors may give the holders\nof any class or series of stock preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.\nHolders of our currently-designated preferred securities and future holders of any securities ranking senior to our common stock have dividend and/or liquidation rights that\nare senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock. Additional issuances of securities senior to our common stock may negatively impact the value of our common stock\nand further restrict the ability of holders of our common stock to receive dividends and/or liquidation rights.\nIn addition to our outstanding borrowings and common stock, our capital structure also includes our currently-designated preferred securities. In the future, we may attempt to\nincrease our capital resources by completing additional offerings of these preferred securities or other equity securities or by issuing debt securities. In the event of a liquidation,\nlenders with respect to any outstanding borrowings, holders of any debt securities, and holders of any preferred stock issuances (including our currently-designated preferred\nsecurities and any other preferred stock with parity ranking we may issue in the future) would receive a distribution of our available assets in full prior to the holders of our\ncommon stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or\nestimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protection against dilutions. As\nadditional acquisition opportunities arise, we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, or we may issue OP Units, which are redeemable for cash or, at\nour option, our common stock on a one-to-one basis, to raise the capital necessary to finance these acquisitions, thus potentially further diluting stockholders’ equity. As such,\nour common stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per-share trading price of our common stock and diluting their interest in us. Further, holders of our\ncurrently-designated preferred securities rank senior in priority of dividend payments, which may restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends to our common stockholders at\nthe current rate, or at all.\nWe may not have sufficient earnings and profits to pay distributions on our currently-designated preferred securities or common stock to be treated as dividends.\nThe distributions payable by us on our currently-designated preferred securities or common stock may exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as calculated\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes, at the time of payment. If that were to occur, it would result in the amount of distributions that exceed our current and accumulated\nearnings and profits being treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in the respective security and then, to the extent of any excess over\nsuch adjusted tax basis, as capital gain.\n26\nTable of Content\nWe may not be able to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, which would subject us to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular\ncorporate rates, thereby reducing the amount of funds available for paying distributions to stockholders.\nOur ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to satisfy requirements set forth in the Code, concerning, among other things, the ownership of our\noutstanding common stock, the nature of our assets, the sources of our income and the amount of our distributions to our stockholders. The REIT qualification requirements are\nextremely complex, and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be\nsuccessful in continuing to operate so as to qualify as a REIT. At any time, new laws, interpretations or court decisions may change the federal tax laws relating to, or the federal\nincome tax consequences of, qualification as a REIT. It is possible that future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause our Board of Directors to revoke\nour REIT election, which it may do without stockholder approval.\nIf we lose our REIT status or if it was revoked, we would face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders\nbecause:\n• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n• we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and might need to borrow money or sell assets to pay any such tax;\n• we also could be subject to increased state and local taxes and, for taxable years ended on or before December 31, 2017, the federal alternative minimum tax; and\n• unless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which\nwe ceased to qualify.\nIf we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, domestic stockholders will be subject to tax as “qualified dividends” to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and\nprofits. The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on such “qualified dividends” is 20%. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we would not be required to make\ndistributions to stockholders, and any distributions to stockholders that are U.S. corporations might be eligible for the dividends received deduction.\nAs a result of all these factors, our failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the\nvalue of our capital stock.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy various tests regarding the sources of our income, the nature and\ndiversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forgo investments\nwe might otherwise make.\nIn particular, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified\nREIT real estate assets. The remainder of our investment in securities other than government securities, securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), and qualified real\nestate assets generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of\nany one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets other than government securities, securities of TRSs, and qualified real estate assets can\nconsist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% (or 25% for taxable years ended on or before December 31, 2017) of the value of our total assets can be\nrepresented by securities of one or more TRSs.\nIf we fail to comply with these requirements, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to\navoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to dispose of otherwise attractive investments to satisfy REIT\nrequirements. These actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nFailure to make required distributions, both prior to and following our REIT election, would jeopardize our REIT status, which could require us to pay taxes and negatively\nimpact our cash available for future distribution.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, each year we must distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, other than any net capital gains. To the extent that\nwe satisfy the distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income. In\naddition, we will incur a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of:\n• 85% of our ordinary income for that year;\n• 95% of our capital gain net income for that year; and\n27\nTable of Content\n• 100% of our undistributed taxable income from prior years.\nWe intend to pay out our income to our stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid corporate income tax and the\n4% excise tax. Differences in timing between the recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to\nborrow money or sell assets to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% excise tax in a\nparticular year.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum federal income tax rate applicable to individuals with respect to income from “qualified dividends” is 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are\nnot eligible for the reduced rates. More favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends may cause investors who are taxed at individual rates to perceive\ninvestments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends.\nIf we fail to meet stock ownership diversification requirements, we would fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, which could require us to pay taxes and negatively\nimpact our cash available for future distribution.\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals during the\nlast half of a taxable year, beginning with the second year after our election to be treated as a REIT. To facilitate compliance with this requirement, our charter prohibits any\nindividual from owning more than 3.3% in value of our outstanding stock. Pursuant to an exception from this limit contained in our charter, as of December 31, 2023, David\nGladstone owned, directly or indirectly, including through certain trusts, aggregate beneficial ownership of approximately 8.3% of our outstanding common stock. In addition,\nthe David and Lorna Gladstone Foundation, a private charitable foundation, owned approximately 0.6% of our outstanding common stock. Our Board of Directors may also\nreduce the 3.3% ownership limitation if it determines that doing so is necessary for us to maintain our qualification for REIT treatment. However, such a reduction would not be\neffective for any stockholder who beneficially owns more than the reduced ownership limit. We believe that we have satisfied the ownership diversification requirements,\nincluding with respect to our taxable year ended December 31, 2023. However, if, at any point in time, we are unable to comply with the ownership diversification requirements,\nwe could fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, which could require us to pay taxes and negatively impact our cash available for future distribution.\nWe will not seek to obtain a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) that we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.\nWe have not requested, and do not expect to request, a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT. An IRS determination that we do not qualify as a REIT would deprive our\nstockholders of the tax benefits of our REIT status only if the IRS determination is upheld in court or otherwise becomes final. To the extent that we challenge an IRS\ndetermination that we do not qualify as a REIT, we may incur legal expenses that would reduce our funds available for distribution to stockholders.\nThe IRS may treat sale-leaseback transactions as loans, which could jeopardize our REIT status.\nThe IRS may take the position that transactions in which we acquire a property and lease it back to the seller do not qualify as leases for federal income tax purposes but are,\ninstead, financing arrangements or loans. If a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the asset or income tests required for REIT\nqualification and consequently could lose our REIT status. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which could cause us to fail the\ndistribution test for REIT qualification.\nInvestments in our common stock may not be suitable for pension or profit-sharing trusts, Keogh Plans or individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”).\nIf you are investing the assets of a pension, profit sharing, 401(k), Keogh or other retirement plan, IRA or benefit plan in us, you should consider:\n• whether your investment is consistent with the applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), or the Code;\n• whether your investment will produce unrelated business taxable income to the benefit plan; and\n• your need to value the assets of the benefit plan annually.\nWe do not believe that under current ERISA law and regulations that our assets would be treated as “plan assets” for purposes of ERISA. However, if our assets were\nconsidered to be plan assets, our assets would be subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, and some of the transactions we have entered into with our Adviser and its\naffiliates could be considered “prohibited transactions” which could cause us, our Adviser and its affiliates to be subject to liabilities and excise taxes. In addition, our officers\nand directors, our Adviser and its affiliates could be deemed to be fiduciaries under ERISA and subject to\n28\nTable of Content\nother conditions, restrictions and prohibitions under Part 4 of Title I of ERISA. Even if our assets are not considered to be plan assets, a prohibited transaction could occur if we\nor any of our affiliates is a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA with respect to a purchase by a benefit plan.\nIf our Operating Partnership fails to maintain its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, its income may be subject to taxation.\nWe intend to maintain the status of the Operating Partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. However, if the IRS were to successfully challenge the status of\nthe Operating Partnership as a partnership, it would be taxable as a corporation. In such event, this would reduce the amount of distributions that the Operating Partnership could\nmake to us. This would also result in our losing REIT status and becoming subject to a corporate level tax on our own income. This would substantially reduce our cash\navailable to pay distributions and the return on your investment. In addition, if any of the entities through which the Operating Partnership owns its properties, in whole or in\npart, loses its characterization as a disregarded entity or a partnership for federal income tax purposes, it would be subject to taxation as a corporation, thereby reducing\ndistributions to the Operating Partnership. Such a re-characterization of an underlying property owner could also threaten our ability to maintain REIT status.\nOur ownership of, and relationship with, TRSs will be limited, and our failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our REIT status and could result in the application of\na 100% excise tax.\nWe have elected to treat Gladstone Land Advisers, Inc. (“Land Advisers”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, as a TRS. We may also form other TRSs\nas part of our overall business strategy. A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if earned directly by the parent REIT. Both the subsidiary and the REIT\nmust jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a TRS. A corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will\nautomatically be treated as a TRS. Overall, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs. A TRS will pay federal,\nstate, and local income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. In addition, the TRS rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a TRS to its\nparent REIT to ensure that the TRS is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a TRS and\nits parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm’s-length basis.\nOur TRSs will pay federal, state, and local income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but is not required to be\ndistributed to us. We anticipate that the aggregate value of any TRS stock and securities owned by us will be less than 20% of the value of our total assets, including the TRS\nstock and securities. We will evaluate all of our transactions with TRSs to ensure that they are entered into on arm’s-length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax. There\ncan be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% limitation or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax.\nLegislative or regulatory income tax changes related to REITs could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations governing REITs and their stockholders, as well as the administrative interpretations of those laws and regulations, are\nconstantly under review and may be changed at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form the U.S. federal\nincome tax laws applicable to us and our stockholders may be enacted. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws and interpretations of U.S. federal tax laws could adversely\naffect an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Market for our Common Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Term Preferred Stock, and Series E Preferred\nStock\nFuture issuances and sales of shares of our common stock, our currently-designated preferred securities, future series of preferred securities, or the perception that such\nissuances will occur, may have adverse effects on the trading prices of our shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future issuances and sales of our common stock, our currently-designated preferred securities, possible future series of preferred\nsecurities, or the availability of shares for future sales on the market price of our publicly-traded common stock and preferred securities. Sales of substantial amounts of our\ncommon stock (including shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of OP Units that we may issue from time to time) or our currently-designated preferred\nsecurities, or the perception that these sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our publicly-traded common stock and preferred securities.\nAn increase in market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOne of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our distribution yield, which is our distribution rate as a percentage of our\nshare price, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates\n29\nTable of Content\nincrease, prospective investors may desire a higher distribution yield on our common stock or may seek securities paying higher dividends or interest. The market price of our\ncommon stock likely will be based primarily on the earnings that we derive from rental income with respect to our properties and our related distributions to stockholders, and\nnot from the underlying appraised value of the properties themselves. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and capital market conditions are likely to affect the market price of\nour common stock, and such effects could be significant. For instance, if interest rates rise without an increase in our distribution rate, the market price of our common stock\ncould decrease because potential investors may require a higher distribution yield on our common stock as market rates on interest-bearing securities, such as bonds, rise.\nShares of our currently-designated preferred securities are subordinated to existing and future debt, and your interests could be diluted by the issuance of additional preferred\nstock or by other transactions.\nPayment of accrued dividends on our currently-designated preferred securities will be subordinated to all of our existing and future debt and will be structurally subordinate to\nthe obligations of our subsidiaries. In addition, we may issue additional shares of another class or series of preferred stock ranking on parity with our currently-designated\npreferred securities with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up. None of the provisions relating to our\ncurrently-designated preferred securities relate to or limit our indebtedness or afford the holders of these securities protection in the event of a highly-leveraged or other\ntransaction, including a merger or the sale, lease, or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets or business, that might adversely affect the holders of our currently-\ndesignated preferred securities, other than in connection with a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined by the Certificate of Designations). These factors may affect the\ntrading price of our publicly-traded preferred securities.\nWe operate as a holding company dependent upon the assets and operations of our subsidiaries, and because of our structure, we may not be able to generate the funds\nnecessary to make distributions on our currently-designated preferred securities.\nWe generally operate as a holding company that conducts its businesses primarily through the Operating Partnership, which, in turn, is a holding company conducting its\nbusiness through its subsidiaries. These subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and are our only sources of income. Accordingly, we are dependent on cash flows and\npayments of funds to us by our subsidiaries as distributions, loans, advances, leases, or other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to make\ndistributions or dividends on our securities. Our subsidiaries’ ability to pay such distributions and/or make such loans, advances, leases, or other payments may be restricted by,\namong other things, applicable laws and regulations, current and future debt agreements, and management agreements into which our subsidiaries may enter, which may impair\nour ability to make cash payments on our securities, including our currently-designated preferred securities. In addition, such agreements may prohibit or limit the ability of our\nsubsidiaries to transfer any of their property or assets to us, any of our other subsidiaries, or to third parties. Our future indebtedness or our subsidiaries’ future indebtedness may\nalso include restrictions with similar effects.\nIn addition, because we are a holding company, stockholders’ claims will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations (whether or not for\nborrowed money) of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Therefore, in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization, claims of holders of our currently-\ndesignated preferred securities will be satisfied only after all of our and the Operating Partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and obligations have been paid in full.\nWe intend to apply for quotation on Nasdaq for the Series E Preferred Stock in the future; however, there is currently no public market for this security. Even after listing, if\nachieved, a liquid secondary trading market may not develop, and the features of the Series E Preferred Stock may not provide holders of such shares with favorable liquidity\noptions.\nThere is currently no public market for the Series E Preferred Stock. We intend to apply to list the Series E Preferred Stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange or\nto include these shares for quotation on a national securities market sometime within 12 months following the Series E Preferred Stock offering’s termination date. Until shares\nof the Series E Preferred Stock are listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, if ever, holders of such shares may be unable to sell them at all or, if they are able\nto, only at substantial discounts from the liquidation preference. Even if the Series E Preferred Stock is listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one\ncalendar year of the respective offerings’ termination date, as anticipated, there is a risk that such shares may be thinly traded, and the market for such shares may be relatively\nilliquid compared to the market for other types of securities, with the spread between the bid and asked prices considerably greater than the spreads of other securities with\ncomparable terms and features. Additionally, our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our securities, including the Series E Preferred Stock, and these\nrestrictions may inhibit your ability to sell the Series E Preferred Stock promptly, or at all. Also, since the Series E Preferred Stock has a stated maturity date, holders may be\nforced to hold the Series E Preferred Stock and receive stated dividends on the shares when, as, and if authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us with no\nassurance as to ever receiving the liquidation preference.\n30\nTable of Content\nWe will be required to terminate the Series E Offering (as defined elsewhere in this Form 10-K) if our common stock and our publicly-traded, currently-designated preferred\nsecurities are all no longer listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange.\nThe Series E Preferred Stock is a “covered security” and therefore is not subject to registration under the state securities, or “Blue Sky,” regulations in the various states in\nwhich it may be sold due to its seniority to our common stock, which is listed on Nasdaq. In the event that our common stock and our publicly-traded, currently-designated\npreferred securities are all no longer listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, we will be required to register this offering in any state in which we offer shares of\nthe Series E Preferred Stock. This would require the termination of this offering and could result in our raising an amount of gross proceeds that is substantially less than the\namount of the gross proceeds we expect to raise if the maximum amount of the Series E Offering is sold. This would reduce our ability to make additional investments and limit\nthe further diversification of our portfolio.\nOur currently-designated preferred securities all bear a risk of redemption by us.\nWe may voluntarily redeem some or all of the Series B Preferred Stock at any time, and we may voluntarily redeem some or all of the Series C Preferred Stock on or after June\n1, 2024. In addition, we may voluntarily redeem some or all of the Series E Preferred Stock on or after the first anniversary of the offering’s termination date. Before January\n31, 2026, we may, at our option, redeem the Series D Term Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time. Any such redemptions may occur at a time\nthat is unfavorable to stockholders. We may have an incentive to redeem any of our series of preferred stock voluntarily if market conditions allow us to issue common stock,\nother preferred stock, or debt securities at a dividend or interest rate that is lower than the dividend rate on such series of preferred stock.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have implemented ongoing processes that are designed to continually identify, assess, manage, and mitigate the dynamic and evolving material risks to us from\ncybersecurity threats. Our cybersecurity threat risks are identified, assessed, managed, and monitored by our Adviser’s and Administrator’s resource management and\ncompliance departments, which work in conjunction with an independent third-party information technology service provider (“ISP”) engaged by our Adviser to manage our\ninformation technology strategy. The ISP regularly performs cyber assessments and assists in maintaining our cyber and information security programs. The ISP proposes\nrecommendations to our Adviser’s resource management and compliance departments, which are then considered by other officers and employees of our Adviser and\nAdministrator working on our behalf before improvements are implemented to our information technology strategy, cybersecurity, and incident response policies, processes,\nand procedures.\nIn addition, regular ongoing cybersecurity threat risk assessments are performed throughout the year and reported to our officers and Board of Directors by our Chief\nCompliance Officer (“CCO”) no less than quarterly. Cybersecurity risks are assessed in general as a part of the overall enterprise risk management for us, but also specifically\nbetween the ISP and our Adviser and Administrator in monitoring and determining not only the risks but also assessing corresponding processes and procedures to mitigate\nthose risks appropriately. Third-party business applications are also incorporated into these risk assessments.\nAs an international service provider, our ISP constantly monitors information technology risk and cybersecurity threats globally. When risks are detected, we, through our\nAdviser and Administrator, consult with the ISP to assess if the risk is a cybersecurity threat to our information technology systems or data. If a risk to our information systems\nor data is identified, we then, through our Adviser and Administrator, work in conjunction with the ISP to implement recommended processes, improvements, or safeguards to\nour systems or processes to address the risks as needed. Relevant examples of such efforts include but are not limited to:\n▪ implementation of industry-leading Cloud solutions and business applications which possess integrated cybersecurity safeguards,\n▪ anti-malware, antivirus, and threat detection software,\n▪ ransomware containment and isolation software,\n31\nTable of Content\n▪ enhanced password requirements and multifactor authentication requirements,\n▪ endpoint encryption,\n▪ intrusion detection and response system conduct file integrity monitoring,\n▪ email archiving, firewalls, and quarantine capabilities,\n▪ mobile device management of business applications,\n▪ frequent systems backups with recovery capabilities, and\n▪ regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.\nContractually, we require the ISP to provide us with annually a third-party report on its systems and on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of its controls\nrelevant to information and cyber security. In addition to the ongoing dialogue and technology interaction between our Adviser and Administrator and our ISP, any significant\nfindings in these reports are shared with us, including our Board of Directors and other officers, to enhance ongoing monitoring and assessment of our information technology\nand cybersecurity risk management.\nWhile our ISP works to create a hardened information technology systems environment, our Adviser and Administrator also regularly trains employees working on our behalf\non the evolving threats and educates them on cybersecurity risks. Whether it is communicating information about the latest cybersecurity threats, assessing employees’\nawareness through mock fraud exercises, social engineering and phishing campaigns, or providing access to a library of educational material about past and newly-evolving\ncybersecurity attacks, our Adviser and Administrator work in concert with the ISP on our behalf to keep employees servicing us informed so as to provide an additional\nprotection barrier through end-user knowledge.\nNotwithstanding our risk management and strategy described above, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material\nadverse effect on us. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Operations—Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our\nbusiness by causing a disruption to our operations or the operations of businesses in which we invest, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or\ndamage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.”\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors is actively engaged in overseeing our cybersecurity and information security program. Our Board of Directors receives regular reports during board\nmeetings from our CCO on our and our Adviser’s and Administrator’s efforts concerning information security and addressing information technology and cybersecurity risks\nno less than quarterly. The reports are distributed to our Board of Directors, and our CCO engages in detailed discussions with the independent board members during the\nindependent members’ session. The reports cover all potentially material cybersecurity threats facing us, as well as key risks and mitigation efforts undertaken by us and our\nAdviser and Administrator. As significant threats or events are identified by management or the ISP between regular reporting periods, our CCO will inform our Board of\nDirectors immediately and keep it informed as to the developments of assessing the risks, mitigating efforts, and potential disclosure. Appropriate members of management and\nthird-party providers will be involved as deemed necessary based on the potential impact.\nManagement personnel most involved with assessing and managing the cybersecurity risks and program with our ISP include our Head of Resources Management, who is also\na member of our Board of Directors, and our CCO. Our Head of Resources Management has more than 30 years of overall experience and more than 20 years directly\nassessing and managing our cyber information technology and human resources systems and the associated security concerns. Our CCO has more than 30 years of overall\nexperience as a CPA, with more than 15 years managing information technology systems and databases, and 15-plus years supporting our Adviser’s and Administrator’s\nresource management department. This includes identifying, assessing, mitigating, and monitoring cyber information security risks. These managers, as well as other\nmanagement personnel, attend various professional continuing education programs that include cybersecurity matters. Certain members of our Board of Directors have, or\npreviously held, positions with other companies, including other public companies, that involved managing risks associated with their cyber and information technology\nsystems. Our Board of Directors regularly receives updates from third parties on various business risks, which include cybersecurity matters.\nITEM 2.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS, AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY\nSECURITIES\nMarket Information\nThe principal market for our common stock is the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “LAND.”\nDistribution Information\nSince our IPO on January 29, 2013, we have never missed a payment of a scheduled distribution on our common stock, which are declared quarterly and paid monthly. Our\nBoard of Directors regularly evaluates our per-share distribution payments as it monitors the capital markets and the impact that the economy has on the Company. The decision\nas to whether to authorize and pay distributions on shares of our common stock in the future, as well as the timing, amount, and composition thereof, will be at the sole and\nabsolute discretion of our Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including our earnings, taxable income, FFO, adjusted FFO, financial condition, liquidity,\ncapital requirements, debt maturities, the availability of capital, contractual prohibitions or other restrictions, legal requirements (including applicable requirements that we must\nsatisfy to qualify and to maintain our qualification to be taxed as a REIT), and general overall economic conditions and other factors. While the statements above concerning our\ndistribution policy represent our current expectations, any actual distribution payable will be determined by our Board of Directors based upon the circumstances at the time of\ndeclaration and the actual number of common shares then outstanding, and any common distribution payable may vary from such expected amounts.\nFor federal income tax purposes, distributions to our stockholders generally consist of ordinary income, capital gains, nontaxable return of capital, or a combination of those\nitems. Distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits (calculated for tax purposes) constitute a non-taxable return of capital rather than a dividend\nand will not be taxable to the extent of the stockholder’s basis in its shares of our stock, which basis will be reduced by an amount equal to such non-taxable distribution. To the\nextent a distribution exceeds the stockholder’s share of both our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder’s basis in its shares of our stock, that\ndistribution will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder’s shares of our stock. Every year, we notify stockholders of the taxability of distributions paid\nto stockholders during the preceding year.\nStockholder Information\nAs of February 12, 2024:\n• there were 19 registered holders of record and approximately 53,664 beneficial owners of our common stock; and\n• other than those owned by the Company, there were no holders of record or beneficial owners of our OP Units. After a mandatory one-year holding period, our OP Units\nare redeemable at the option of the holder for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock on a one-for-one basis.\nOP Unit Redemptions\nSince January 1, 2023, through the date of this filing, no OP Units were tendered for redemption. There are currently no OP Units outstanding other than those owned by the\nCompany.\nSale of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not sell any unregistered shares of stock during the three months or year ended December 31, 2023.\nIssuer Purchaser of Equity Securities\nWe did not purchase any class of our equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the three months or year ended December 31, 2023.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative stockholder return (assuming reinvestment of distributions) of our common stock with that of the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index\n(“S&P 500”) and the FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index (“FNAR”), which is a market capitalization-weighted index that includes all REITs that are listed on the New York Stock\nExchange, the American\n34\nTable of Content\nStock Exchange, or the Nasdaq National Market List.

RESERVED\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nITEM 7.\nThe following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nGeneral\nWe are an externally-managed, agricultural real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that is engaged in the business of owning and leasing farmland. We are not a grower of crops,\nnor do we typically farm the properties we own. We currently own 168 farms comprised of 111,836 acres across 15 states in the U.S. We also own several farm-related\nfacilities, such as cooling facilities, packinghouses, processing facilities, and various storage facilities.\nWe conduct substantially all of our activities through, and all of our properties are held, directly or indirectly, by, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the “Operating\nPartnership”). Gladstone Land Corporation controls the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and currently owns, directly or indirectly, 100.0% of the units of\nlimited partnership interest in the\n35\nTable of Content\nOperating Partnership (“OP Units”). In addition, we have elected for Gladstone Land Advisers, Inc. (“Land Advisers”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, to be treated as a\ntaxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”).\nGladstone Management Corporation (our “Adviser”) manages our real estate portfolio pursuant to an advisory agreement, and Gladstone Administration, LLC (our\n“Administrator”), provides administrative services to us pursuant to an administration agreement. Our Adviser and our Administrator collectively employ all of our personnel\nand pay directly their salaries, benefits, and general expenses.\nAs of February 20, 2024:\n• we owned 168 farms comprised of 111,836 total acres across 15 states in the U.S.;\n• our occupancy rate (based on farmable acreage) was 98.9%, and our farms were leased to 93 different, unrelated third-party tenants growing over 60 different types of\ncrops;\n• the weighted-average remaining lease term across our agricultural real estate holdings was 5.9 years; and\n• the weighted-average term to maturity of our notes and bonds payable was 8.8 years, and over 99.9% of our notes and bonds payable bore interest at fixed rates; on a\nweighted-average basis, the remaining fixed-price term of our borrowings was 4.2 years, with an expected weighted-average effective interest rate (after interest\npatronage, as described below) of 3.34% over that term.\nBusiness Environment\nImpact of Inflation and Interest Rates\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index (“CPI”) grew at an annual rate of 3.4% through December 31, 2023, as overall inflation continued to\nease from the peak levels experienced in the summer of 2022, when it reached the highest rates seen in over 40 years. The increase in food prices has also slowed but has\ngenerally kept pace with the rate of inflation until the past couple of months, as the overall food segment increased at an annual rate of 2.7% through December 31, 2023. In\naddition, according to the NCREIF Farmland Index, which, as of December 31, 2023, consisted of approximately $16.6 billion of farms across the U.S., the total return on U.S.\nfarmland (including appreciation and income) was 5.0% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Despite the slowdown in food prices in recent months, prices remain high,\nas the overall food segment increased by 25.2% since from December 2019 to December 2023, outpacing overall inflation of 19.4% over the same time period. If the increases\nin food prices continue to outpace or at least keep pace with inflation, we believe this will help mitigate any increase in input costs experienced by our farm operators.\nTo combat inflation, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark funds rate 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023, resulting in the highest target rate seen since January\n2011. Since that time, it has held rates flat, and many now expect the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates later this year. While we do not currently expect additional rate\nhikes, the timing of rate cuts, if any, remains uncertain. Despite cooling inflation and a strong labor market, the Federal Reserve has indicated its desire to see more evidence of\ninflation being on a sustainable path to its target rate of 2.0%. As a result of this uncertainty, interest rates remain somewhat volatile. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury\nNote has withdrawn from the 16-year high it achieved in October 2023 but still remains above 4.0%. As such, interest rates on long-term financing continue to be high, limiting\nour ability to finance new acquisitions at favorable terms.\nOver 99.9% of our borrowings are currently at fixed rates, and on a weighted-average basis, these rates are fixed at an effective interest rate of 3.34% for another 4.2 years. As\nsuch, with respect to our current borrowings, we have experienced minimal impact from the recent increases in interest rates, and we believe we are well-protected against the\npotential of continued high interest rates or any further interest rate increases.\nCalifornia Water Outlook\nMoving into 2024, we continue to see the impacts of the extremely wet year California experienced starting in early 2023. Due to the extreme rainfall and snowpack over the\npast year, California has come out of drought conditions, and its reservoir levels remain above historical averages. The 2023 water year carry-over should provide stability in\n2024, reducing the dependency on historic rain events to keep the state out of drought conditions. If 2024 proves to be another average or above-average year in terms of\nprecipitation, we expect the continuation of programs developed by certain California water districts for the long-term storage of excess water supplies, which would create\nopportunities to capture and store more water.\nWith the continued implementation of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (“SGMA”), farmland operators continue to experience groundwater restrictions across the\nstate. These restrictions have led to the implementation of supplemental water projects that allow farmland owners and operators to capture or import surplus surface water\nsupplies. Significant investments were made in these projects in 2023, led by farmers and water districts to take advantage of the excess water supplies made available by the\nstate. These water supplies are critical to the long-term water strategy for farmers, allowing them to acquire\n36\nTable of Content\nsupplemental water in wet years and store that water for use in dry years when supplemental water is in short supply or unavailable.\nFactors Impacting Agricultural Land Values in our Regions of Focus\nWestern U.S.\nIn the past year, land values in the western U.S. have been heavily impacted by the higher interest rate environment and depressed crop pricing, particularly in almonds, wine\ngrapes, and apples. The almond and wine grape industries have experienced large amounts of acres being removed, and the increased cost of capital is preventing much of that\nacreage from being replanted at this time. Row crops and pistachios are faring much better and are experiencing stronger profitability, despite an increase in bearing acreage of\npistachios. With water being more abundant, row crop acreage has increased, which could put downward pressure on future pricing of these crops. The cost of most crop inputs\nhave leveled off; however, there continue to be shortages of certain equipment and some petroleum-based inputs.\nLarge amounts of land are becoming available in the Central Valley of California; however, while smaller acreages are transacting rather quickly, larger holdings are sitting on\nthe market longer. Groundwater plans to be in compliance with SGMA are being approved and implemented, which continues to significantly impact land values. Values of\nland that is short on water are decreasing to levels not seen in decades, while land with sufficient water resources is selling for extremely high prices, a trend that we expect to\nsee continue for the next several years. Coastal California land is still in short supply, and values are either stable or increasing. Land values in the Pacific Northwest have been\nrelatively stable despite troubles in the wine grape and apple industries.\nSoutheastern U.S.\nValues of farmland in the Southeast growing fruits and vegetables continue to increase at a steady pace, driven in part by significant and sustained migration to that region. Our\nland holdings in Florida, in particular, have benefited greatly from a substantial amount of residential development and state projects taking place in the surrounding areas, all\nputting upward pressure on the value of our portfolio in the region.\nDespite ongoing pressure from production in Mexico, the strawberry industry has continued to thrive, resulting in upward rent pressure on our farms, and vegetable ground has\nalso seen steady demand. Further, after a decade-long decline in citrus due to falling consumer demand and production declines caused by the plant disease known as “citrus\ngreening,” we are seeing the citrus industry start to stabilize, as acreage has right-sized, and new applications to combat citrus greening and other blights have proven very\neffective.\nPortfolio Diversification\nSince our initial public offering in January 2013 (the “IPO”), we have expanded our portfolio from 12 farms leased to 7 different, unrelated tenants to a current portfolio of 168\nfarms leased to 93 different, unrelated third-party tenants who grow over 60 different types of crops on our farms. Our investment focus is in farmland suitable for growing\neither fresh produce annual row crops (e.g., certain berries and vegetables) or certain permanent crops (e.g., almonds, blueberries, pistachios, and wine grapes), with an\nancillary focus on farmland growing certain commodity crops (e.g., beans and corn).\nThe acquisition of additional farms since our IPO has also allowed us to further diversify our portfolio geographically. The following table summarizes the geographic locations\n(by state) of our farms owned as of and during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n37\nTable of Content\nAs of and For the Year Ended As of and For the Year Ended As of and For the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\n% of % of % of\nNo. % of Total No. % of Total No. % of Total\nof Total Total Lease Lease of Total Total Lease Lease of Total Total Lease Lease\nState Farms Acres Acres Revenue Revenue Farms Acres Acres Revenue Revenue Farms Acres Acres Revenue Revenue\nCalifornia(1) 63 34,844 30.1% $ 59,143 65.5% 63 34,844 30.1% $ 61,118 68.5% 62 33,027 29.3% $ 49,644 65.9%\nFlorida(2) 26 22,468 19.4% 15,076 16.7% 26 22,606 19.5% 14,537 16.3% 26 22,591 20.1% 13,675 18.2%\nWashington 6 2,520 2.2% 4,651 5.1% 6 2,529 2.2% 3,401 3.8% 3 1,384 1.2% 2,384 3.2%\nColorado 12 32,773 28.3% 2,564 2.8% 12 32,773 28.3% 2,153 2.4% 12 32,773 29.1% 2,675 3.6%\nArizona 6 6,320 5.5% 2,263 2.5% 6 6,320 5.5% 2,100 2.4% 6 6,280 5.6% 1,951 2.6%\nOregon 6 898 0.8% 2,181 2.4% 6 898 0.8% 1,710 1.9% 5 726 0.6% 854 1.1%\nNebraska 9 7,782 6.7% 1,778 2.0% 9 7,782 6.7% 1,712 1.9% 9 7,782 6.9% 1,588 2.1%\nMichigan 23 1,892 1.6% 966 1.1% 23 1,892 1.6% 786 0.9% 23 1,892 1.7% 1,040 1.4%\nMaryland 6 987 0.9% 461 0.5% 6 987 0.8% 453 0.5% 6 987 0.9% 476 0.6%\nTexas 1 3,667 3.2% 450 0.5% 1 3,667 3.2% 450 0.5% 1 3,667 3.3% 450 0.6%\nSouth Carolina 3 597 0.5% 244 0.3% 3 597 0.5% 244 0.3% 3 597 0.5% 244 0.3%\nGeorgia 2 230 0.2% 224 0.3% 2 230 0.2% 224 0.3% 2 230 0.2% 31 —%\nNew Jersey 3 116 0.1% 129 0.1% 3 116 0.1% 129 —% 3 116 0.1% 75 0.1%\nNorth Carolina 2 310 0.3% 114 0.1% 2 310 0.3% 145 0.2% 2 310 0.3% 150 0.2%\nDelaware 1 180 0.2% 75 0.1% 1 180 0.2% 74 0.1% 1 180 0.2% 81 0.1%\nTOTALS 169 115,584 100.0% $ 90,319 100.0% 169 115,731 100.0% $ 89,236 100.0% 164 112,542 100.0% $ 75,318 100.0%\n(1) According to the California Chapter of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, there are eight distinct growing regions within California; our farms are spread across six of these\ngrowing regions.\n(2) Includes a 3,748-acre farm that was sold on January 11, 2024.\nLeases\nGeneral\nMost of our leases are on a triple-net basis, an arrangement under which, in addition to rent, the tenant is required to directly pay the related taxes, insurance costs, maintenance,\nand other operating costs. Our leases generally have original terms ranging from 3 to 10 years for farms growing row crops and 7 to 15 years for farms growing permanent crops\n(in each case, often with options to extend the lease further). Rent is generally payable to us in advance on either an annual or semi-annual basis, with such rent typically subject\nto periodic escalation clauses provided for within the lease. Currently, 105 of our farms are leased on a pure, triple-net basis, 45 farms are leased on a partial-net basis (with us,\nas landlord, responsible for all or a portion of the related property taxes), 3 farms are leased on a single-net basis (with us, as landlord, responsible for the related property taxes,\nas well as certain maintenance, repairs, and insurance costs), and 15 farms are vacant. Additionally, 27 of our farms are leased under agreements that include a variable rent\ncomponent, called “participation rents,” that are based on the gross revenues earned on the respective farms (though such leases generally include a guarantee of a minimum\namount of rental income).\nLease Expirations\nAgricultural leases are often shorter term in nature (relative to leases of other types of real estate assets), so in any given year, we may have multiple leases up for extension or\nrenewal. The following table summarizes the lease expirations by year for the farms owned and with leases in place as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nNumber of Lease Revenue for the % of Total\nExpiring Expiring / Expired % of Total Year Ended December Lease\nYear Leases(1) Leased Acreage Acreage 31, 2023 Revenue\n2024 8 9,171 7.9% $ 9,361 10.4%\n2025 11 20,729 17.9% 7,899 8.7%\n2026 11 11,706 10.1% 5,851 6.5%\n2027 6 7,123 6.2% 10,304 11.4%\n2028 13 5,198 4.5% 6,422 7.1%\nThereafter 49 56,349 48.8% 46,608 51.6%\nOther(2) 13 37 —% 485 0.5%\nTerminated/expired leases and sold properties(3) N/A 5,271 4.6% 3,389 3.8%\nTotals 111 115,584 100.0% $ 90,319 100.0%\n(1) Certain lease agreements encompass multiple farms.\n38\nTable of Content\n(2) Primarily consists of ancillary leases (e.g., renewable energy leases; oil, gas, and mineral leases; telecommunications leases; etc.) with varying expirations on certain of our farms.\n(3) Includes approximately $463,000 of lease revenue recorded from 15 farms on which the respective leases expired during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and remain vacant, and approximately\n$2.9 million from one farm that was sold subsequent to December 31, 2023, which expired on December 31, 2023.\nWe currently have one agricultural lease scheduled to expire within the next six months on a farm in California. We are currently in negotiations with the existing tenant on the\nfarm, as well as other potential tenants, and we anticipate being able to renew the lease at its current market rental rate without incurring any downtime on the farm. We may\nchoose to replant a portion of this farm with new plantings, which would likely result in a decrease in cash rent for the first few years while the new plantings are being\nestablished. Regarding all vacancies and upcoming lease expirations, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew the existing leases or execute new leases at rental\nrates favorable to us, if at all, or be able to find replacement tenants, if necessary.\nRecent Developments\nPortfolio Activity—Existing Properties\nProperty Sales\nOn June 23, 2023, we completed the sale of a 138-acre parcel of unfarmed land in Florida for $9.6 million. Including closing costs, we recognized a net gain on the sale of\napproximately $6.4 million.\nOn January 11, 2024, we completed the sale of a 3,748-acre farm in Martin County, Florida, for approximately $65.7 million. Including closing costs, we recognized a net gain\non the sale of approximately $10.4 million.\nLeasing Activity\nThe following table summarizes certain leasing activity that has occurred on our existing properties since January 1, 2023, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands,\nexcept for footnotes):\nPRIOR LEASES NEW LEASES(1)\nTotal # of Leases Lease Total # of Leases Lease\nNumber Total Annualized with Structures Annualized Wtd.

See Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies—Operating Obligations,” within the\naccompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these and other commitments.\n(2) Based on the minimum cash rental payments guaranteed under the applicable leases (presented on an annualized basis), as required under GAAP, and generally excludes contingent rental payments, such as\nparticipation rents.\n(3) “NNN” refers to leases under triple-net lease arrangements, “NN” refers to leases under partial-net lease arrangements, and “N” refers to leases under single-net lease arrangements, in each case, as\ndescribed above under “Leases—General.”\nVacant, Self-operated, and Non-accrual Properties\nDuring a portion of the year ended December 31, 2023, we had 22 farms (7 in California, 14 in Michigan, and 1 in Washington) that were either vacant, self-operated, or on\nwhich lease revenues were recognized on a cash basis (due to credit issues with three tenants causing us to determine that the full collectability of the remaining rental payments\nunder the respective leases were not deemed to be probable).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded lease revenues related to the aforementioned farms of approximately $2.8 million (including approximately $240,000\nof participation rents), as compared to approximately $4.0 million (including approximately $829,000 of participation rents) and approximately $4.3 million (including\napproximately $121,000 of participation rents) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCurrently, 15 farms (14 in Michigan and 1 in Washington) are vacant, and 5 farms in California remain on non-accrual status.\nRegarding the vacant farms, we are exploring both leasing and selling options, and we are in discussions with both potential tenants and potential buyers for these farms. We\ncurrently expect to come to agreements within the next six months on these farms; however, there can be no guarantee that we will be able to reach lease or sale agreements with\ntenants or buyers at favorable terms, or at all.\nRegarding the properties currently on non-accrual status, the tenants on three of the five farms are current with their rental payments to us. We are continuing to work with the\ntenant leasing the other two farms and will seek to come to an agreement\n39\nTable of Content\nfor the remaining rental payments, if possible. Such agreement, if one can be reached, may include placing the tenant on a payment plan, deferring a portion of the rent owed to\nus, or agreeing to terminate the lease. In the event of a termination, we estimate that we would be able to find new tenants to lease each of these properties to at market rental\nrates within 1 to 12 months.\nWater Asset Acquisitions\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, we obtained a contract to purchase 1,003 acre-feet of banked water held by Semitropic Water Storage District (“SWSD”), a\nwater storage district located in Kern County, California, which was received from one of our tenants as partial consideration for a rent payment owed. We subsequently\nexecuted the contract to purchase all 1,003 acre-feet of banked water for an aggregate cost of approximately $61,000. We currently have a total of 46,003 acre-feet of banked\nwater held by SWSD at a total carrying value of approximately $34.5 million.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to participate in a groundwater recharge program established by Westlands Water District (“WWD”), a water\ndistrict located in Fresno County, California. Under the program, WWD will pay for surplus surface water to be delivered to individual landowners’ properties with district-\napproved groundwater recharge facilities, also known as “water banks.” The landowner would be allowed to keep 50% of the net amount of groundwater credits generated\nunder the program (after allowing for certain leave-behind and evaporative losses), and the remaining 50% would be used to recharge the aquifer and retained by WWD.\nDelivery of water under this program is subject to surplus water availability at WWD’s discretion, and WWD has not yet announced a termination date for this program. To\ndate, we have obtained 397 water credits, which represents 50% of the total net water credits generated and confirmed by WWD under the program thus far, at a total carrying\nvalue of approximately $111,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we also entered into various other agreements with certain third parties (including local water districts and private individuals) to\neither buy water directly, buy a portion of other water districts’ surface water allocations in future years in which allocations are granted, or to store surface water on others’\nbehalf in one of our groundwater recharge facilities in exchange for a portion of the net groundwater credits produced and recognized by the respective water district.\nWe currently own a total of 46,400 acre-feet of long-term water assets, and our investments in these long-term water assets have an aggregate carrying value of approximately\n$34.6 million.\nTo date, we have invested approximately $1.8 million to construct groundwater recharge facilities on two of our farms, and we have invested an additional $1.8 million in the\naggregate in connection with these agreements that are expected to result in additional groundwater credits in the future; however, the amount and timing of these credits, if any,\nis currently unknown and is dependent upon and subject to the recognition of such credits by the respective water districts, in their sole discretion.\nCalifornia Floods\nIn January 2023, periods of heavy rainfall in California resulted in floods that impacted several areas of the state, including regions where certain of our farms are located. As a\nresult of the flooding, one of our farms in the Central Valley suffered damage to certain structures located on the farm, and we estimated the carrying value of the structures on\nthis property damaged by the floods to be approximately $855,000. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we wrote down the carrying value of these structures\nand also recorded a corresponding property and casualty loss. Certain of our other farms in California suffered minor damage as a result of the floods, but no other farms were\nmaterially impacted.\nIn addition, in February 2024, certain parts of California, particularly the southern part of the state, experienced a “one-in-one-thousand year” rainfall event, as atmospheric\nriver storms caused widespread flooding and mudslides in multiple areas. Certain of our farms in the state suffered minor damage as a result of the storms, but no farms were\nmaterially impacted.\nFinancing Activity\nDebt Activity\nLoan Repayments\nFrom January 1, 2023, through the date of this filing, we repaid approximately $52.2 million of notes and bonds that were either maturing or scheduled for a price reset. On a\nweighted-average basis, these borrowings bore interest at a stated rate of 3.55% and an effective interest rate (after interest patronage, where applicable) of 3.43%.\nMetLife Facility\nOn December 14, 2023, we amended our facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”), which currently consists of a $75.0 million long-term note payable\n(the “2020 MetLife Term Note”), $75.0 million of revolving equity lines of credit (the “MetLife Lines of Credit”), and a $100.0 million long-term note payable (the “2022\nMetLife Term Note,” and\n40\nTable of Content\ntogether with the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the MetLife Lines of Credit, the “Current MetLife Facility”). Pursuant to the amendment, the maturity dates of the MetLife Lines\nof Credit were extended to December 15, 2033. As part of this amendment, we paid aggregate fees of approximately $188,000 to MetLife.\nFarmer Mac Facility\nOn June 2, 2023, we amended our agreement with Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”), which provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate amount of\n$225.0 million (the “Farmer Mac Facility”). Pursuant to the amendment, the date through which we may issue new bonds under the Farmer Mac Facility was extended to\nDecember 31, 2026, and the final maturity date for new bonds issued under the facility will be the date that is ten years from the applicable issuance date.\nFarm Credit Notes Payable—Interest Patronage\nFrom time to time since September 2014, we, through certain subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, have entered into various loan agreements (collectively, the “Farm\nCredit Notes Payable”) with 13 different Farm Credit associations (collectively, “Farm Credit”). During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded interest patronage\nof approximately $2.3 million related to interest accrued on the Farm Credit Notes Payable during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2022, we received approximately $113,000 of interest patronage, as certain Farm Credit associations paid a portion of the 2022 interest patronage (which relates\nto interest accrued during 2022 but is typically paid during the first half of 2023) early. In total, 2022 interest patronage resulted in a 24.1% reduction (approximately 109 basis\npoints) to the interest rates on such borrowings. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately $111,000 of interest patronage, as\ncertain Farm Credit associations paid a portion of the 2023 interest patronage early. For further discussion on interest patronage, refer to Note 4, “Borrowings—Farm Credit\nNotes Payable—Interest Patronage,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Activity\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nOn April 3, 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for a continuous public offering (the “Series C Offering”) of our 6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable\nPreferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). Under the Series C Offering, as amended, we were permitted to sell up to 10,200,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock on\na “reasonable best efforts” basis through Gladstone Securities at an offering price of $25.00 per share (the “Primary Series C Offering”) and up to 200,000 additional shares of\nour Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan (the “DRIP”) at a price of $22.75 per share. The Primary Series C Offering terminated on December\n31, 2022, and the DRIP was terminated effective March 22, 2023.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, we listed the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LANDP.” Trading of the Series C Preferred Stock on\nNasdaq commenced on June 8, 2023.\nFrom January 1, 2023, through the date we listed the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq, we issued approximately 14,069 shares of the Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to the\nDRIP and redeemed 48,913 shares that were tendered for optional redemption, which we satisfied with an aggregate cash payment of approximately $1.2 million.\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn November 9, 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for a continuous public offering (the “Series E Offering”) of up to 8,000,000 shares of our newly-\ndesignated 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series E Preferred Stock”), on a “reasonable best efforts” basis through\nGladstone Securities at an offering price of $25.00 per share. See Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Gladstone Securities—Dealer-Manager Agreements,” for a discussion\nof the commissions and fees to be paid to Gladstone Securities in connection with the Series E Offering.\nThe following table summarizes the sales of our Series E Preferred Stock that occurred from January 1, 2023, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands):\nNumber of Weighted-average\nShares Sold Offering Price Per Share Gross Proceeds Net Proceeds(1)\n247,781 $ 24.96 $ 6,184 $ 5,575\n(1) Net of underwriting discounts and selling commissions and dealer-manager fees borne by us. Aggregate selling commissions and dealer-manager fees paid to Gladstone Securities as a result of these sales\nwas approximately $609,000.\n41\nTable of Content\nThe Series E Offering will terminate on the date (the “Series E Termination Date”) that is the earlier of (i) December 31, 2025 (unless terminated or extended by our Board of\nDirectors) and (ii) the date on which all 8,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock offering in the Series E Offering are sold. There is currently no public market for shares of\nSeries E Preferred Stock. We intend to apply to list the Series E Preferred Stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one calendar year after the Series E\nTermination Date; however, there can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such timeframe, or at all.\nCommon Stock—At-the-Market Program\nOn May 12, 2020, we entered into equity distribution agreements with Virtu Americas, LLC, and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (each a “Sales Agent”), that, as subsequently\namended, permitted us to issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $260.0 million\n(the “ATM Program”). On April 13, 2023, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution agreements with the Sales Agents to allow us to sell shares of our\ncommon stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500.0 million.\nThe following table summarizes the activity under the ATM Program from January 1, 2023, through the date of this filing (dollars in thousands):\nWeighted-average\nOffering Price\nNumber of Shares Sold Per Share Gross Proceeds Net Proceeds(1)\n788,045 $ 19.34 $ 15,240 $ 15,087\n(1) Net of underwriter commissions.\nLIBOR Transition\nThe majority of our debt is at fixed rates, and we currently have very limited exposure to variable-rate debt. Previously, our variable-rate debt was based upon the London\nInterbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), which was phased out in June 2023. LIBOR has since transitioned to a new standard rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”),\nwhich was formally adopted by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee in July 2021 as a benchmark interest rate that incorporates certain overnight repo market data\ncollected from multiple data sets. The intent was to adjust the SOFR to minimize the differences between the interest that a borrower was paying using LIBOR versus what it\nwill be paying SOFR. Our lines of credit with MetLife and four term loans with Rabo AgriFinance LLC (which are effectively fixed through our entry into interest swap\nagreements) were previously indexed based on LIBOR, and all have since transitioned to SOFR, resulting in a minimal impact to our overall operations.\nOur Adviser and Administrator\nWe are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Adviser and our Administrator (both affiliates of ours), which collectively employ all of our\npersonnel and pay their salaries, benefits, and general expenses directly. The investment advisory agreement with our Adviser that was in effect from January 1, 2020, through\nJune 30, 2021 (the “Prior Advisory Agreement”), was amended and restated effective July 1, 2021 (as amended, the “Current Advisory Agreement,” and together with the Prior\nAdvisory Agreement, the “Advisory Agreements”). The Current Advisory Agreement revised the calculation of the base management fee beginning with the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2021, while all other terms of the Prior Advisory Agreement remained the same. Each of the Advisory Agreements and the current administration agreement\nwith our Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”) were approved unanimously by our Board of Directors, including, specifically, our independent directors.\nA summary of certain compensation terms within the Advisory Agreements and a summary of the Administration Agreement is below.\nAdvisory Agreements\nPursuant to each of the Advisory Agreements, our Adviser is compensated in the form of a base management fee, an incentive fee, a capital gains fee, and a termination fee. Our\nAdviser does not charge acquisition or disposition fees when we acquire or dispose of properties, as is common in other externally-managed REITs. The base management and\nincentive fees are described below. For information on the capital gains and termination fees, refer to Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Our Adviser and Administrator—\nAdvisory Agreements,” within the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Prior Advisory Agreement, through June 30, 2021, a base management fee was paid quarterly and was calculated at an annual rate of 0.50% (0.125% per\nquarter), of the prior calendar quarter’s “Gross Tangible Real Estate,”\n42\nTable of Content\ndefined as the gross cost of tangible real estate owned by us (including land and land improvements, permanent plantings, irrigation and drainage systems, farm-related\nfacilities, and other tangible site improvements), prior to any accumulated depreciation, and as shown on our balance sheet or the notes thereto for the applicable quarter.\nPursuant to the Current Advisory Agreement, beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2021, a base management fee is paid quarterly and is calculated at an\nannual rate of 0.60% (0.15% per quarter) of the prior calendar quarter’s Gross Tangible Real Estate.\nIncentive Fee\nPursuant to each of the Advisory Agreements, an incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears if the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO for a particular quarter exceeds a\nhurdle rate of 1.75% (7.0% annualized) of the prior calendar quarter’s Total Adjusted Common Equity.\nFor purposes of this calculation, Pre-Incentive Fee FFO is defined in each of the Advisory Agreements as FFO (also as defined in each of the Advisory Agreements) accrued by\nthe Company during the current calendar quarter (prior to any incentive fee calculation for the current calendar quarter), less any dividends paid on preferred stock securities\nthat are not treated as a liability for GAAP purposes. In addition, Total Adjusted Common Equity is defined as common stockholders’ equity plus non-controlling common\ninterests in our Operating Partnership, if any (each as reported on our balance sheet), adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses and certain other one-time events and non-\ncash items.\nWe pay our Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO quarterly, as follows:\n• no Incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.0% annualized);\n• 100% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than\n2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized); and\n• 20% of the amount of our Pre-Incentive fee FFO, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized).\nQuarterly Incentive Fee Based on Pre-Incentive Fee FFO\nPre-Incentive Fee FFO\n(expressed as a percentage of Total Adjusted Common Equity)\nPercentage of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO allocated to Incentive Fee\nAdministration Agreement\nPursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay for our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses incurred while performing its obligations to us, including, but not\nlimited to, rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our Administrator’s employees, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general\ncounsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president, general counsel, and secretary), and their respective staffs. Our allocable portion of the Administrator’s\nexpenses is generally derived by multiplying our Administrator’s total expenses by the approximate percentage of time the Administrator’s employees perform services for us in\nrelation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our Administrator under similar contractual agreements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make judgments that are subjective in nature to make certain estimates and\nassumptions. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment regarding the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties, and, as a result, actual results\ncould materially differ from these estimates. A summary of all of our significant accounting policies are provided in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in\nthe accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, located elsewhere in this Form 10-K, and a summary of our critical accounting policies is below. We consider\nthese policies to be critical because they involve estimates and assumptions that require complex, subjective or significant judgments in their application and that materially\naffect our results of operations. There were no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n43\nTable of Content\nPurchase Price Allocation\nWhen we acquire real estate, we allocate the purchase price to: (i) the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, consisting primarily of land, improvements (including\nirrigation and drainage systems), permanent plantings, and farm-related facilities and, if applicable, (ii) any identifiable intangible assets and liabilities, which primarily consist\nof the values of above- and below-market leases, in-place lease values, lease origination costs, and tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values.\nCertain of our acquisitions involve sale-leaseback transactions with newly-originated leases, and other of our acquisitions involve the acquisition of farmland that is already\nbeing operated as rental property, in which case we will typically assume the lease in place at the time of acquisition. We generally consider both types of acquisitions to be\nasset acquisitions under ASC 360, “Property Plant and Equipment,” which requires us to capitalize the transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition. ASC 360\nfurther requires that the purchase price of real estate be allocated to (i) the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and, if applicable, (ii) any identifiable intangible\nassets and liabilities, by valuing the property as if it was vacant, based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of such assets and liabilities as of the date of\nacquisition.\nFor a more detailed discussion on this accounting policy, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Real Estate and Lease Intangibles,” in the accompanying\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nReal Estate Impairment Evaluation\nWe account for the impairment of our real estate assets in accordance with ASC 360, which requires us to periodically review the carrying value of each property to determine\nwhether indicators of impairment exist or if depreciation periods should be modified. If circumstances support the possibility of impairment, we prepare a projection of the total\nundiscounted future cash flows of the specific property and compare them to the net book value of the property to determine whether the carrying value of the property is\nrecoverable. If impairment is indicated, the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property’s discounted\nfuture cash flows using certain market-derived terms. Any material changes to the estimates and assumptions used in this analysis could have a significant impact on our results\nof operations, as the changes would impact our determination of whether impairment is deemed to have occurred and the amount of impairment loss that we would recognize.\nFor a more detailed discussion on this accounting policy, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Real Estate Impairment Evaluation,” in the accompanying\nnotes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Recently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements\nfor a description of recently-issued accounting pronouncements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the purposes of the following discussions on certain operating revenues and expenses:\n▪ With regard to the comparison between the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\n▪ Same-property basis represents farms owned as of December 31, 2021, which were not vacant at any point during either period presented and full collectability of\nfuture rental payments under the respective leases was deemed probable during the entirety of both periods;\n▪ Properties acquired or disposed of are farms that were either acquired or disposed of at any point subsequent to December 31, 2021. From January 1, 2022,\nthrough December 31, 2023, we acquired five new farms and had one partial farm disposition; and\n▪ Vacant, self-operated, or non-accrual properties are:\n▪ Farms that were vacant (either wholly or partially) at any point during either period presented. Five of our farms were vacant during a portion of either of\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022;\n▪ Farms that were self-operated at any point during either period presented. 11 of our farms were self-operated (on a temporary basis via management\nagreements with unrelated third-parties) during a portion of the year ended December 31, 2023; and\n▪ Farms with leases where revenue was recognized on a cash basis during either period presented (rather than a straight-line basis) due to full collectability of\nfuture rental payments under the respective leases deemed not to be probable as a result of tenant credit issues. During a portion of the year ended\n44\nTable of Content\nDecember 31, 2023, we recognized revenue from four different leases with three separate tenants (encompassing six different farms) on a cash basis.\nA comparison of results of components comprising our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nOperating revenues:\nLease revenue:\nFixed lease payments $ 83,695 $ 81,423 $ 2,272 2.8%\nVariable lease payments – participation rents 5,890 7,703 (1,813) (23.5)%\nVariable lease payments – tenant reimbursements 734 110 624 567.3%\nTotal lease revenue 90,319 89,236 1,083 1.2%\nOther operating revenue 79 — 79 NM\nTotal operating revenues 90,398 89,236 1,162 1.3%\nOperating expenses:\nDepreciation and amortization 37,161 35,366 1,795 5.1%\nProperty operating expenses 4,201 2,819 1,382 49.0%\nBase management and incentive fees 10,374 11,532 (1,158) (10.0)%\nAdministration fee 2,255 2,005 250 12.5%\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,924 2,740 184 6.7%\nWrite-off of costs associated with offering of Series C cumulative redeemable preferred\nstock — 853 (853) NM\nTotal operating expenses 56,915 55,315 1,600 2.9%\nOperating income $ 33,483 $ 33,921 $ (438) (1.3)%\nNM = Not Meaningful\nOperating Revenues\nLease Revenue\nThe following table provides a summary of our lease revenue during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nSame-property basis:\nFixed lease payments $ 76,866 $ 76,182 $ 684 0.9%\nParticipation rents 5,650 6,874 (1,224) (17.8)%\nTotal – Same-property basis 82,516 83,056 (540) (0.7)%\nProperties acquired or disposed of:\nFixed lease payments 4,357 2,067 2,290 110.8%\nTotal – Properties acquired or disposed of 4,357 2,067 2,290 110.8%\nVacant, self-operated, or non-accrual properties:\nFixed lease payments 2,472 3,174 (702) (22.1)%\nParticipation rents 240 829 (589) (71.0)%\nTotal – Vacant, self-operated, or non-accrual properties 2,712 4,003 (1,291) (32.3)%\nTenant reimbursements(1) 734 110 624 567.3%\nTotal Lease revenues $ 90,319 $ 89,236 $ 1,083 1.2%\n(1) Tenant reimbursements generally represent tenant-reimbursed property operating expenses on certain of our farms, including property taxes, insurance premiums, and other property-related expenses.\nSimilar amounts were also recorded as property operating expenses during the respective periods.\nSame-property Basis – 2023 compared to 2022\n45\nTable of Content\nLease revenues from fixed lease payments increased primarily due to additional rents earned on capital improvements completed on certain of our farms, partially offset by the\nexecution of one lease agreement in the fourth quarter of 2022, pursuant to which we agreed to reduce the fixed base rent amount in exchange for increasing the participation\nrent component in the lease, the majority of which was realized in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe decrease in participation rents was primarily driven by lower production (i.e., pounds per acre) on certain almond and pistachio farms (partly due to the alternate-bearing\nnature of such tree crops but also due to the harvest of such crops coming at the end of a multi-year drought), coupled with weaker crop prices, particularly in the almond\nmarket, which continued to be hampered with oversupply exacerbated by supply chain disruptions that occurred during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther – 2023 compared to 2022\nLease revenue from properties acquired or disposed of increased primarily due to additional revenues earned on new farms acquired subsequent to December 31, 2021.\nFixed lease payments from vacant, self-operated, or non-accrual properties decreased primarily due to revenue from certain of our leases being recognized on a cash basis\nduring a portion of the year ended December 31, 2023 (rather than a straight-line basis), due to full collectability of future rental payments under the respective leases deemed\nnot to be probable as a result of tenant credit issues. In addition, 11 of our farms were self-operated (on a temporary basis via management agreements with unrelated third-\nparties) and 5 of our farms were vacant during portions of the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in lease revenue from vacant, self-operated, or non-accrual\nproperties was partially offset by cash collections (in part or in whole) from tenants occupying certain of these properties during the year ended December 31, 2023. No revenue\nhas been recognized as a result of operations at farms that were self-operated during any period presented.\nThe fluctuations in tenant reimbursement revenue are primarily driven by payments made by certain tenants on our behalf (pursuant to the lease agreements) to unconsolidated\nentities of ours that convey water to the respective properties. As such, the timing of tenant reimbursement revenue fluctuates as payments are made by our tenants. Amounts\nrecorded during the current year include increased reimbursements from certain tenants for costs to delivery water to their farms via a pipeline owned by an unconsolidated\nentity of ours, as well as late fees received from certain tenants.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue consists of non-lease revenue generated as a result of activities performed on certain of our properties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we\nrecognized approximately $79,000 of non-cash revenue associated with the transfer and storing of surplus water on behalf of a government municipality using a groundwater\nrecharge facility constructed on one of our farms. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Other Operating Revenue,” and Note 3, “Real Estate and\nIntangible Assets—Investments in Water Assets,” within the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOperating Expenses\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization expense incurred on new farms acquired subsequent to December 31,\n2021, as well as additional depreciation expense associated with new capital improvements made on certain of our existing farms. The increase was partially offset by a\ndecrease attributable to certain assets reaching the end of their useful lives.\nProperty Operating Expenses\nProperty operating expenses consist primarily of real estate taxes, repair and maintenance expense, insurance premiums, and other miscellaneous operating expenses paid for\ncertain of our properties. The following table provides a summary of the property operating expenses recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in\nthousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nSame-property basis $ 2,785 $ 2,407 $ 378 15.7%\nProperties acquired or disposed of 6 29 (23) (79.3)%\nVacant, self-operated properties, or non-accrual, properties 723 273 450 164.8%\nTenant-reimbursed property operating expenses(1) 687 110 577 524.5%\nTotal Property operating expenses $ 4,201 $ 2,819 $ 1,382 49.0%\n(1) Represents certain operating expenses (property taxes, insurance premiums, and other property-related expenses) paid by us that, per the respective leases, are required to be reimbursed to us by the tenant.\nSimilar amounts are also recorded as lease revenue when earned in accordance with the lease.\n46\nTable of Content\nSame-property Basis – 2023 compared to 2022\nProperty operating expenses increased primarily due to additional property management and consulting fees incurred across our portfolio, as well as higher legal fees related to\ndrafting new lease agreements. We also recorded additional repairs and maintenance expense as a result of minor damage caused by natural disasters at certain of our farms.\nThis increase was partially offset by a decrease in real estate tax expense.\nOther – 2023 compared to 2022\nProperty operating expenses on properties acquired or disposed of decreased, primarily due to additional legal fees incurred in the prior year periods on certain farms acquired\nsubsequent to December 31, 2021.\nProperty operating expenses attributable to vacant, self-operated, or non-accrual properties increased primarily due to additional legal fees incurred in connection with rent\ncollection, lease termination, or re-leasing efforts on such farms, as well as an increase in real estate tax expense that the prior tenants were previously responsible for.\nThe fluctuations in tenant-reimbursed property operating expenses are primarily driven by miscellaneous property operating costs incurred by us in connection with our\nownership interests in certain unconsolidated entities, for which our tenants are contractually obligated to reimburse us under the terms of the respective leases. Such expenses\nwill fluctuate commensurate with the timing and amount of miscellaneous operating costs incurred by the underlying entities. Amounts recorded during the current year include\nadditional costs to deliver water to certain of our farms via a pipeline owned by an unconsolidated entity of ours, which costs were reimbursed to us by our tenants.\nRelated-Party Fees\nThe following table provides the calculations of the base management and incentive fees due to our Advisor pursuant to the Current Advisory Agreement for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands; for further discussion on certain defined terms used below, refer to Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions,” within the\naccompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements):\n47\nTable of Content\nQuarters Ended\nMarch 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Year to Date\nFY 2023 Fee Calculations:\nBase Management Fee:\nGross Tangible Real Estate(1)(2) $ 1,432,394 $ 1,431,761 $ 1,433,713 $1,437,268\nQuarterly rate 0.150 % 0.150 % 0.150 % 0.150 %\nBase management fee(3) $ 2,149 $ 2,148 $ 2,150 $ 2,156 $ 8,603\nIncentive Fee:\nTotal Adjusted Common Equity(1)(2) $ 358,689 $ 362,411 $ 360,339 $ 353,412\nFirst hurdle quarterly rate 1.750 % 1.750 % 1.750 % 1.750 %\nFirst hurdle threshold $ 6,277 $ 6,342 $ 6,306 $ 6,185\nSecond hurdle quarterly rate 2.1875 % 2.1875 % 2.1875 % 2.1875 %\nSecond hurdle threshold $ 7,846 $ 7,928 $ 7,882 $ 7,731\nPre-Incentive Fee FFO(1) $ 5,303 $ 4,400 $ 7,095 $ 7,167\n100% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of first hurdle threshold, up to\nsecond hurdle threshold $ — $ — $ 789 $ 982\n20% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of second hurdle threshold — — — —\nTotal Incentive fee(3) $ — $ — $ 789 $ 982 $ 1,771\nTotal fees due to Adviser, net $ 2,149 $ 2,148 $ 2,939 $ 3,138 $ 10,374\nFY 2022 Fee Calculations:\nBase Management Fee:\nGross Tangible Real Estate(1)(2) $ 1,357,800 $ 1,361,757 $ 1,390,646 $ 1,427,482\nQuarterly rate 0.150 % 0.150 % 0.150 % 0.150 %\nBase management fee(3) $ 2,037 $ 2,043 $ 2,086 $ 2,141 $ 8,307\nIncentive Fee:\nTotal Adjusted Common Equity(1)(2) $ 378,299 $ 381,201 $ 364,955 $ 361,186\nFirst hurdle quarterly rate 1.750 % 1.750 % 1.750 % 1.750 %\nFirst hurdle threshold $ 6,620 $ 6,671 $ 6,387 $ 6,321\nSecond hurdle quarterly rate 2.1875 % 2.1875 % 2.1875 % 2.1875 %\nSecond hurdle threshold $ 8,275 $ 8,339 $ 7,983 $ 7,901\nPre-Incentive Fee FFO(1) $ 7,751 $ 4,819 $ 6,892 $ 7,944\n100% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of first hurdle threshold, up to\nsecond hurdle threshold $ 1,131 $ — $ 505 $ 1,580\n20% of Pre-Incentive Fee FFO in excess of second hurdle threshold — — — 9\nTotal Incentive fee(3) $ 1,131 $ — $ 505 $ 1,589 $ 3,225\nTotal fees due to Adviser, net $ 3,168 $ 2,043 $ 2,591 $ 3,730 $ 11,532\n(1) As defined in the Current Advisory Agreement.\n(2) As of the end of the respective prior quarters.\n(3) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n48\nTable of Content\nThe base management fee increased primarily due to additional assets acquired and improvements made on certain of our farms since December 31, 2021.\nOur Adviser earned incentive fees during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 due to our Pre-Incentive Fee FFO (as defined in the Advisory Agreements)\nexceeding the required hurdle rate of the applicable equity base during the third and fourth quarters of 2023 and during the first, third, and fourth quarters of 2022.\nThe administration fee paid to our Administrator increased primarily due to hiring additional personnel and us using a higher overall share of our Administrator’s resources in\nrelation to those used by other funds and affiliated companies serviced by our Administrator.\nOther Operating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional fees, director fees, stockholder-related expenses, overhead insurance, acquisition-related costs for\ninvestments no longer being pursued, and other miscellaneous expenses. General and administrative expenses increased during the current year, primarily due to an increase in\nprofessional fees (driven by higher legal and accounting fees), additional costs expensed related to amending our Current MetLife Facility, and an increase in stockholder-\nrelated expenses related to the listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in acquisition-related costs for investments no\nlonger being pursued.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we wrote off approximately $853,000 of costs (including approximately $798,000 of unamortized deferred offering costs) related to\nthe Series C Offering due to an amendment that reduced the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be offered.\nA comparison of results of other components contributing to net loss attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is below\n(dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nOperating income $33,483 $33,921 $ (438.00) (1.3)%\nOther income (expense)\nOther income 3,633 3,441 192 5.6%\nInterest expense (23,665) (25,738) 2,073 (8.1)%\nDividends declared on cumulative term preferred stock (3,019) (3,019) — —%\nGain (loss) on dispositions of real estate assets, net 5,208 (3,760) 8,968 (238.5)%\nProperty and casualty loss, net (1,016) (56) (960) 1,714.3%\nLoss from investments in unconsolidated entities (59) (73) 14 (19.2)%\nTotal other expense, net (18,918) (29,205) 10,287 (35.2)%\nNet income 14,565 4,716 9,849 208.8%\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests — (8) 8 (100.0)%\nNet income attributable to the Company 14,565 4,708 9,857 209.4%\nAggregate dividends declared on and charges related to extinguishment of cumulative\nredeemable preferred stock (24,417) (19,718) (4,699) 23.8%\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders $ (9,852) $ (15,010) $ 5,158 (34.4)%\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income, which generally consists of interest patronage received from Farm Credit (as defined in Note 4, “Borrowings,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated\nfinancial statements) and interest earned on short-term investments, increased primarily due to additional income earned on short-term investments due to higher interest rates,\npartially offset by less interest patronage received from Farm Credit (primarily due to decreased borrowings from Farm Credit).\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded approximately $2.3 million of interest patronage from Farm Credit related to interest accrued during 2022, as\ncompared to approximately $2.8 million of interest patronage recorded during the prior-year period that related to interest accrued during 2021. In addition, during the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2022, we received approximately $113,000 of interest patronage related to interest accrued during 2022, as certain Farm Credit associations paid a\nportion of 2022 interest patronage (which is typically paid during the first half of 2023) early. In total, 2022 interest patronage resulted in a 24.1% reduction (approximately 109\nbasis points) to the interest rate of such borrowings. In\n49\nTable of Content\naddition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately $111,000 of interest patronage, as certain Farm Credit associations paid a portion of\nthe 2023 interest patronage early.\nInterest expense decreased, primarily due to a decrease in overall borrowings. The weighted-average principal balance of our aggregate borrowings (excluding our cumulative\nterm preferred stock) outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2023, was approximately $595.8 million, as compared to approximately $654.7 million for the prior-year\nperiod. Excluding interest patronage received on certain of our Farm Credit borrowings and the impact of debt issuance costs, the weighted average interest rate charged on our\naggregate borrowings was 3.79% and 3.77% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a net capital gain, driven by the sale of a 138-acre parcel of unfarmed land in Florida for $9.6 million, which, after\naccounting for closing costs, resulted in a net gain of approximately $6.4 million. The net losses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022, related to the disposals of\ncertain irrigation and other improvements on certain of our farms.\nThe net property and casualty loss related to net expenses incurred and insurance recoveries received for certain improvements that were damaged due to natural disasters. The\nproperty and casualty loss recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023, was the result of the heavy rainfall that occurred in California in early 2023 and the resulting\nflooding, which damaged certain structures located on one of our farms in the Central Valley.\nThe aggregate dividends paid on our cumulative redeemable preferred stock increased due to additional shares of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock\nissued and outstanding during the current year.\nComparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nA comparison of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,\n2022, beginning on page 45 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on February 21, 2023.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nOur current short- and long-term sources of funds include cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, borrowings (including the undrawn commitments available\nunder the Current MetLife Facility), and issuances of additional equity securities. Our current available liquidity is approximately $209.7 million, consisting of approximately\n$60.1 million in cash on hand and, based on the current level of collateral pledged, approximately $149.6 million of availability under the Current MetLife Facility (subject to\ncompliance with covenants) and other undrawn notes or bonds. In addition, we currently have certain properties valued at a total of approximately $130.5 million that are\nunencumbered and eligible to be pledged as collateral.\nOver 99.9% of our borrowings are currently at fixed rates, and on a weighted-average basis, these rates are fixed at an effective interest rate (after interest patronage) of 3.34%\nfor another 4.2 years. In addition, the weighted-average remaining term of our notes and bonds payable is approximately 8.8 years. As such, with respect to our current\nborrowings, we have experienced minimal impact from increased interest rates over the past year, and we believe we are well-protected against any further interest rate\nincreases. Despite ongoing uncertainty in the markets, based on discussions with our lenders, we do not believe there will be a credit freeze on agricultural lending in the near\nterm. We are in compliance with all of our debt covenants under our respective credit facilities and borrowings, and we believe we currently have adequate liquidity to cover all\nnear- and long-term debt obligations and operating expenses.\nFuture Capital Needs\nOur short- and long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of making principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings; funding our general operating costs;\nmaking dividend payments on our currently-designated preferred securities; making distributions to stockholders (including non-controlling OP Unitholders, if any) to maintain\nour qualification as a REIT; and, as capital is available, funding capital improvements on existing farms and new farmland and farm-related acquisitions consistent with our\ninvestment strategy.\nIn the near term, we believe that our current and short-term cash resources will be sufficient to service our debt; fund our current operating costs; pay dividends on our\ncurrently-designated preferred securities; and fund our distributions to stockholders (including non-controlling OP Unitholders). We expect to meet our long-term liquidity\nrequirements through\n50\nTable of Content\nvarious sources of capital, including long-term mortgage indebtedness and bond issuances, future equity issuances (including, but not limited to, shares of our Series E Preferred\nStock, OP Units through our Operating Partnership as consideration for future acquisitions, and shares of common stock through our ATM Program), and other secured and\nunsecured borrowings.\nWe intend to use a significant portion of any current and future available liquidity to purchase additional farms and farm-related facilities. We continue to actively seek and\nevaluate acquisitions of additional farms and farm-related facilities that satisfy our investment criteria, and we have several properties that are in various stages of our due\ndiligence process. However, all potential acquisitions will be subject to our due diligence investigation of such properties, and there can be no assurance that we will be\nsuccessful in identifying or acquiring any properties in the future.\nOperating Commitments and Obligations\nSee Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion around certain operating and\nground lease obligations.\nCash Flow Resources\nThe following table summarizes total net cash flows for operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\nNet change in cash from:\nOperating activities $ 40,081 $ 43,788 $ (3,707) (8.5)%\nInvesting activities (3,768) (85,484) 81,716 95.6%\nFinancing activities (78,883) 86,129 (165,012) (191.6)%\nNet change in Cash and cash equivalents $ (42,570) $ 44,433 $ (87,003) (195.8)%\nOperating Activities\nThe majority of cash from operating activities is generated from the rental payments we receive from our tenants, which is first used to fund our property-level operating\nexpenses, with any excess cash being primarily used for principal and interest payments on our borrowings, management fees to our Adviser, administrative fees to our\nAdministrator, and other corporate-level expenses. Cash provided by operating activities decreased, primarily due to the acquisition of additional long-term water assets during\n2023 and the timing of certain rental cash payments received and interest payments made during the respective periods. This was partially offset by a decrease in aggregate fees\npaid to our Advisor during the current year.\nInvesting Activities\nThe change in cash from investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in aggregate cash paid for acquisitions of new farms and capital improvements on existing farms\nduring the current year, partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of a 138-acre parcel of unfarmed land in Florida for $9.6 million during the current year, which\nresulted in a net gain of approximately $6.4 million.\nFinancing Activities\nThe change in cash from financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in aggregate net proceeds received from preferred and common equity offerings of approximately\n$153.9 million and a decrease in aggregate net borrowings of approximately $11.2 million.\nDebt Capital\nMetLife Facility\nThe Current MetLife Facility currently consists of an aggregate of $75.0 million of revolving equity lines of credit and an aggregate of $175.0 million of term notes. We\ncurrently have $200,000 outstanding under the lines of credit and $36.9 million outstanding on the term notes. While $212.9 million of the full commitment amount under the\nCurrent MetLife Facility remains undrawn, based on the current level of collateral pledged, we currently have approximately $110.2 million of availability under the Current\nMetLife Facility. As recently amended, the revolving equity lines of credit mature on December 15, 2033, and the draw period for both term notes expires on December 31,\n2024, after which MetLife has no obligation to disburse any additional undrawn funds under the term notes.\n51\nTable of Content\nFarmer Mac Facility\nAs amended in June 2023, the Farmer Mac Facility provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate amount of $225.0 million by December 31, 2026, after which, Farmer Mac\nhas no obligation to purchase additional bonds under this facility. To date, we have issued aggregate bonds of approximately $100.1 million under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nFarm Credit and Other Lenders\nSince September 2014, we have closed on multiple loans with various different Farm Credit associations (for additional information on these associations, see Note 4,\n“Borrowings,” within the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements). We also have borrowing relationships with several other agricultural lenders and are\ncontinuously reaching out to other lenders to establish prospective new relationships. As such, we expect to enter into additional borrowing agreements with existing and new\nlenders in connection with certain potential new acquisitions in the future.\nEquity Capital\nThe following table provides information on equity sales that have occurred since January 1, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nWeighted-average\nNumber of Offering Price\nType of Issuance Shares Sold Per Share Gross Proceeds Net Proceeds(1)\nSeries E Preferred Stock 247,781 24.96 6,184 5,575\nCommon Stock – ATM Program 788,045 19.34 15,240 15,087\n(1) Net of selling commissions and dealer-manager fees or underwriting discounts and commissions (in each case, as applicable).\nOur 2023 Registration Statement (as defined in Note 8, “Equity—Registration Statement,” within the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements) permits us\nto issue up to an aggregate of $1.5 billion in securities, consisting of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depository shares, subscription rights, and units,\nincluding through separate, concurrent offerings of two or more of such securities. To date, we have issued approximately $4.2 million of Series E Preferred Stock, and $2.2\nmillion of common stock under the 2023 Registration Statement.\nIn addition, we have the ability to, and expect to in the future, issue additional OP Units to third parties as consideration in future property acquisitions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFunds from Operations, Core Funds from Operations, and Adjusted Funds from Operations\nThe National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) developed funds from operations (“FFO”) as a relative non-GAAP supplemental measure of operating\nperformance of an equity REIT to recognize that income-producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the same basis as determined under GAAP. FFO, as defined\nby NAREIT, is net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of property and impairment losses on property, plus depreciation and\namortization of real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. We further present core FFO (“CFFO”) and adjusted FFO (“AFFO”)\nas additional non-GAAP financial measures of our operational performance, as we believe both CFFO and AFFO improve comparability on a period-over-period basis and are\nmore useful supplemental metrics for investors to use in assessing our operational performance on a more sustainable basis than FFO. We believe that these additional\nperformance metrics, along with the most directly-comparable GAAP measure, provide investors with helpful insight regarding how management measures our ongoing\nperformance, as each of CFFO and AFFO (and their respective per-share amounts) are used by management and our Board of Directors, as appropriate, in assessing overall\nperformance, as well as in certain decision-making analysis, including, but not limited to, the timing of acquisitions and potential equity raises (and the type of securities to\noffer in any such equity raises), the determination of any fee credits, and declarations of distributions on our common stock. The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein\nhave limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe\nthat net income is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure to each of FFO, CFFO, and AFFO.\nSpecifically, we believe that FFO is helpful to investors in better understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and\namortization expense on real estate assets, as we believe that GAAP historical cost\n52\nTable of Content\ndepreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, particularly with farmland real estate, the value of which does not diminish\nin a predictable manner over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Further, we believe that CFFO and AFFO are helpful in understanding our operating performance in\nthat it removes certain items that, by their nature, are not comparable on a period-over-period basis and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance. In addition, we\nbelieve that providing CFFO and AFFO as additional performance metrics allows investors to gauge our overall performance in a manner that is more similar to how our\nperformance is measured by management (including their respective per-share amounts), as well as by analysts and the overall investment community.\nWe calculate CFFO by adjusting FFO for the following items:\n• Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses. Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses (including due diligence costs on acquisitions not consummated and certain\nauditing and accounting fees incurred that were directly related to completed acquisitions or dispositions) are incurred for investment purposes and do not correlate with\nthe ongoing operations of our existing portfolio. Further, certain auditing and accounting fees incurred vary depending on the number and complexity of acquisitions or\ndispositions completed during the period. Due to the inconsistency in which these costs are incurred and how they have historically been treated for accounting purposes,\nwe believe the exclusion of these expenses improves comparability of our operating results on a period-to-period basis.\n• Other adjustments. We will adjust for certain non-recurring charges and receipts and will explain such adjustments accordingly. We believe the exclusion of these\namounts improves comparability of our operating results on a period-to-period basis and will apply consistent definitions of CFFO for all prior-year periods presented to\nprovide consistency and better comparability.\nFurther, we calculate AFFO by adjusting CFFO for the following items:\n• Rent adjustments. This adjustment removes the effects of straight-lining rental income, as well as the amortization related to above-market lease values and certain\nnoncash lease incentives and accretion related to below-market lease values, certain other deferred revenue, and tenant improvements, resulting in rental income\nreflected on a modified accrual cash basis. In addition to these adjustments, we also modify the calculation of cash rents within our definition of AFFO to provide greater\nconsistency and comparability due to the period-to-period volatility in which cash rents are received. To coincide with our tenants’ harvest seasons, our leases typically\nprovide for cash rents to be paid at various points throughout the lease year, usually annually or semi-annually. As a result, cash rents received during a particular period\nmay not necessarily be comparable to other periods or represent the cash rents indicative of a given lease year. Therefore, we further adjust AFFO to normalize the cash\nrent received pertaining to a lease year over that respective lease year on a straight-line basis, resulting in cash rent being recognized ratably over the period in which the\ncash rent is earned. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we adjusted our definition of AFFO to exclude from this adjustment the removal of lease\nincentives that were a result of previous cash disbursements made by us to or on behalf of our tenants. The results of all years presented, including those of the prior\nyears, have been adjusted in the table below to conform with this new definition.\n• Amortization of debt issuance costs. The amortization of costs incurred to obtain financing is excluded from AFFO, as it is a non-cash expense item that is not directly\nrelated to the operating performance of our properties.\n• Other adjustments. We will adjust for certain non-cash charges and receipts and will explain such adjustments accordingly. We believe the exclusion of such non-cash\namounts improves comparability of our operating results on a period-to-period basis and will apply consistent definitions of AFFO for all prior-year periods presented to\nprovide consistency and better comparability.\nWe believe the foregoing adjustments aid our investors’ understanding of our ongoing operational performance.\nFFO, CFFO, and AFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, which, unlike FFO, CFFO, and AFFO, generally reflects all cash\neffects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income, and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to\ncash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions. Comparisons of FFO, CFFO, and AFFO, using the NAREIT definition for FFO and the\ndefinitions above for CFFO and AFFO, to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the definitions used by\nsuch REITs.\nDiluted funds from operations (“Diluted FFO”), diluted core funds from operations (“Diluted CFFO”), and diluted adjusted funds from operations (“Diluted AFFO”) per share\nare FFO, CFFO, and AFFO, respectively, divided by the weighted-average number of total shares (including shares of our common stock and OP Units held by non-controlling\nlimited partners) outstanding on a fully-diluted basis during a period. We believe that diluted earnings per share is the most directly-comparable GAAP measure to each of\nDiluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share. Because many REITs provide Diluted FFO, CFFO, and\n53\nTable of Content\nAFFO per share information to the investment community, we believe these are useful supplemental measures when comparing us to other REITs.\nWe believe that FFO, CFFO, and AFFO and Diluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share are useful to investors because they provide investors with a further context for\nevaluating our FFO, CFFO, and AFFO results in the same manner that investors use net income and EPS in evaluating net income.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our FFO, CFFO, and AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 to the most directly-comparable GAAP\nmeasure, net income, and a computation of diluted FFO, CFFO, and AFFO per share, using the weighted-average number of total shares (including shares of our common stock\nand OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders) outstanding during the respective periods (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 14,565 $ 4,716 $ 3,514\nLess: Aggregate dividends declared on and charges related to extinguishment of cumulative redeemable preferred stock(1) (24,417) (19,718) (12,258)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders (9,852) (15,002) (8,744)\nPlus: Real estate and intangible depreciation and amortization 37,161 35,366 27,183\n(Less) plus: (Gains) losses on dispositions of real estate assets, net (5,208) 3,760 2,537\nAdjustments for unconsolidated entities(2) 92 57 36\nFFO available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders 22,193 24,181 21,012\nPlus: Acquisition- and disposition-related expenses, net 149 438 355\nPlus (less): Other nonrecurring charges (receipts), net(3) 1,418 1,023 (12)\nCFFO available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders 23,760 25,642 21,355\nNet rent adjustments (4,519) (3,371) (2,414)\nPlus: Amortization of debt issuance costs 1,065 1,085 1,172\n(Less) plus: Other non-cash (receipts) charges, net(4) 17 907 246\nAFFO available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ 20,323 $ 24,263 $ 20,359\nWeighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 35,733,742 34,563,460 30,357,268\nWeighted-average common non-controlling OP Units outstanding — 61,714 166,067\nWeighted-average shares of common shares outstanding, fully diluted 35,733,742 34,625,174 30,523,335\nDiluted FFO per weighted-average total common share $ 0.62 $ 0.70 $ 0.69\nDiluted CFFO per weighted-average total common share $ 0.66 $ 0.74 $ 0.70\nDiluted AFFO per weighted-average total common share $ 0.57 $ 0.70 $ 0.67\nDistributions declared per total common share $ 0.55 $ 0.55 $ 0.54\n(1) Includes (i) cash dividends paid on our cumulative redeemable preferred stock, (ii) the value of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the DRIP, and (iii) the pro-rata write-off of\noffering costs related to shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock that were redeemed during the respective periods.\n(2) Represents our pro-rata share of depreciation expense recorded in unconsolidated entities during the respective periods.\n(3) Consists primarily of (i) net property and casualty losses (recoveries) recorded and the cost of related repairs expensed as a result of the damage caused to certain improvements by natural disasters on\ncertain of our farms, (ii) costs related to the amendment, termination, and listing of shares from the Series C Offering that were expensed, and (iii) the write-off of certain unallocated costs related to a prior\nuniversal registration statement.\n(4) Consists of (i) the amount of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock paid via issuing new shares (pursuant to the DRIP), (ii) the pro-rata write-off of offering costs related to shares of cumulative\nredeemable preferred stock that were redeemed, which were noncash charges, (iii) our remaining pro-rata share of (income) loss recorded from investments in unconsolidated entities during the respective\nperiods, and (iv) less noncash income recorded during 2023 as a result of additional water assets received as consideration in certain transactions.\nNet Asset Value\nReal estate companies are required to record real estate using the historical cost basis of the real estate, adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization, and, as a result,\nthe carrying value of the real estate does not typically change as the fair value of the assets change. Thus, one challenge is determining the fair value of the real estate in order to\nallow stockholders to see the value of the real estate increase or decrease over time, which we believe is useful to our investors.\nDetermination of Fair Value\n54\nTable of Content\nOur Board of Directors reviews and approves the valuations of our properties pursuant to a valuation policy approved by our Board of Directors (the “Valuation Policy”). Such\nreview and approval occurs in three phases: (i) prior to its quarterly meetings, the Board of Directors receives written valuation recommendations and supporting materials that\nare provided by professionals of the Adviser and Administrator, with oversight and direction from the chief valuation officer, who is also employed by the Administrator\n(collectively, the “Valuation Team”); (ii) the valuation committee of the Board of Directors (the “Valuation Committee”), which is comprised entirely of independent directors,\nmeets to review the valuation recommendations and supporting materials; and (iii) after the Valuation Committee concludes its meeting, it and the chief valuation officer\npresent the Valuation Committee’s findings to the entire Board of Directors so that the full Board of Directors may review and approve the fair values of our properties in\naccordance with the Valuation Policy. Further, on a quarterly basis, the Board of Directors reviews the Valuation Policy to determine if changes thereto are advisable and also\nreviews whether the Valuation Team has applied the Valuation Policy consistently.\nPer the Valuation Policy, our valuations are generally derived based on the following:\n• For properties acquired within 12 months prior to the date of valuation, the purchase price of the property will generally be used as the current fair value unless overriding\nfactors apply. In situations where OP Units are issued as partial or whole consideration in connection with the acquisition of a property, the fair value of the property will\ngenerally be the lower of: (i) the agreed-upon purchase price between the seller and the buyer (as shown in the purchase and sale agreement or contribution agreement and\nusing the agreed-upon pricing of the OP Units, if applicable), or (ii) the value as determined by an independent, third-party appraiser.\n• For real estate we acquired more than one year prior to the date of valuation, we determine the fair value either by relying on estimates provided by independent, third-\nparty appraisers or through an internal valuation process. In addition, if significant capital improvements take place on a property, we will typically have those properties\nreappraised upon completion of the project by an independent, third-party appraiser. In any case, we intend to have each property valued by an independent, third-party\nappraiser via a full appraisal at least once every three years, with interim values generally being determined by either: (i) a restricted appraisal (a “desk appraisal”)\nperformed by an independent, third-party appraiser, or (ii) our internal valuation process.\nVarious methodologies were used, both by the appraisers and in our internal valuations, to determine the fair value of our real estate, including the sales comparison, income\ncapitalization (or a discounted cash flow analysis), and cost approaches of valuation. In performing their analyses, the appraisers typically (i) conducted site visits to the\nproperties (where full appraisals were performed), (ii) discussed each property with our Adviser and reviewed property-level information, including, but not limited to, property\noperating data, prior appraisals (as available), existing lease agreements, farm acreage, location, access to water and water rights, potential for future development, and other\nproperty-level information, and (iii) reviewed information from a variety of sources about regional market conditions applicable to each of our properties, including, but not\nlimited to, recent sale prices of comparable farmland, market rents for similar farmland, estimated marketing and exposure time, market capitalization rates, and the current\neconomic environment, among others. In performing our internal valuations, we will consider the most recent appraisal available and use similar methodologies in determining\nan updated fair value. We will also obtain updated market data related to the property, such as updated sales and market rent comparisons and market capitalization rates, and\nperform an updated assessment of the tenants’ credit risk profiles, among others. Sources of this data may come from market inputs from recent acquisitions of our own\nportfolio of real estate, recent appraisals of properties we own that are similar in nature and in the same region (as applicable) as the property being valued, market conditions\nand trends we observe in our due diligence process, and conversations with appraisers, brokers, and farmers.\nA breakdown of the methodologies used to value our properties and the aggregate value as of December 31, 2023, determined by each method is shown in the table below\n(dollars in thousands, except in footnotes):\nNumber of Total Farm Acre-feet Net Cost Current % of Total\nValuation Method Farms Acres Acres of Water Basis(1) Fair Value Fair Value\nPurchase Price — — — 1,400 $ 573 $ 573 0.0%\nSales Price 1 3,748 3,748 — 53,626 65,652 4.2%\nInternal Valuation 3 6,189 4,730 — 20,034 36,000 2.3%\nThird-party Appraisal(2) 165 105,647 87,667 45,000 1,265,859 1,464,249 93.5%\nTotal 169 115,584 96,145 46,400 $ 1,340,092 $ 1,566,474 100.0%\n(1) Consists of the initial acquisition price (including the costs allocated to both tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed), plus subsequent improvements and other capitalized costs paid\nfor by us that were associated with the properties, and adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization.\n(2) Appraisals performed between March 2023 and December 2023.\nSome of the significant assumptions used by appraisers and the Valuation Team in valuing our portfolio as of December 31, 2023, include land values per farmable acre, market\nrental rates per farmable acre and the resulting net operating income\n55\nTable of Content\n(“NOI”) at the property level, and capitalization rates, among others. These assumptions were applied on a farm-by-farm basis and were selected based on several factors,\nincluding comparable land sales, surveys of both existing and current market rates, discussions with other brokers and farmers, soil quality, size, location, and other factors\ndeemed appropriate. A summary of these significant assumptions is provided in the following table:\nAppraisal Assumptions Internal Valuation Assumptions\nRange Weighted Range Weighted\n(Low - High) Average (Low - High) Average\nLand Value (per farmable acre) $708 – $123,280 $35,320 $5,512 – $17,521 $13,268\nMarket NOI (per farmable acre) $230 – $3,536 $1,526 N/A N/A\nMarket Capitalization Rate 3.30% – 5.30% 4.43% N/A N/A\nNote: Figures in the table above apply only to the farmland portion of our portfolio and exclude assumptions made related to water, farm-related facilities (e.g., cooling facilities), and other structures on our\nproperties (e.g., residential housing).\nOur Valuation Team reviews the appraisals, including the significant assumptions and inputs used in determining the appraised values, and considers any developments that may\nhave occurred since the time the appraisals were performed. Developments considered that may have an impact on the fair value of our real estate include, but are not limited\nto, changes in tenant credit profiles, changes in lease terms (such as expirations and notices of non-renewals or to vacate), and potential asset sales (particularly those at prices\ndifferent from the appraised values of our properties).\nManagement believes that the purchase prices of the farms acquired during the previous 12 months and the most recent appraisals available for the farms acquired prior to the\nprevious 12 months fairly represent the current market values of the properties as of December 31, 2023, and, accordingly, did not make any adjustment to these values.\nA quarterly rollforward of the change in our portfolio value for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from the prior value basis as of September 30, 2023, is provided in\nthe table below (dollars in thousands):\nTotal portfolio fair value as of September 30, 2023 $ 1,579,331\nPlus: Acquisition of water assets during the three months ended December 31, 2023 551\nChange in value of farms during the three months ended December 31, 2023\nFarms valued based on sales price $ 1,951\nFarms valued via third-party appraisals (15,359)\nNet change in value of farms during the three months ended December 31, 2023 (13,408)\nTotal portfolio fair value as of December 31, 2023 $ 1,566,474\nManagement also determined fair values of all of its long-term borrowings and preferred stock. Using a discounted cash flow analysis, management determined that the fair\nvalue of all long-term encumbrances on our properties as of December 31, 2023, was approximately $529.4 million, as compared to a carrying value (excluding unamortized\nrelated debt issuance costs) of approximately $576.8 million. The fair values of our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Term Preferred Stock were\ndetermined using the closing stock prices as of December 31, 2023, of $19.25 per share, $19.00 per share, and $23.75 per share, respectively. Finally, pursuant to Financial\nIndustry Regulatory Authority Rule 2310(b)(5), with the assistance of a third-party valuation expert, we determined the estimated value of our Series E Preferred Stock to be\n$25.00 per share as of December 31, 2023 (see Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K).\nCalculation of Estimated Net Asset Value\nTo provide our stockholders with an estimate of the fair value of our real estate assets, we intend to estimate the fair value of our farms and farm-related properties and provide\nan estimated net asset value (“NAV”) on a quarterly basis. NAV is a non-GAAP, supplemental measure of financial position of an equity REIT and is calculated as total equity,\nadjusted for the increase or decrease in fair value of our real estate assets and long-term borrowings (including any preferred stock required to be treated as debt for GAAP\npurposes) relative to their respective cost bases. Further, we calculate NAV per common share by dividing NAV by our total common shares outstanding (consisting of our\ncommon stock and OP Units held by non-controlling limited partners).\nThe fair values presented above and their usage in the calculation of net asset value per share presented below have been prepared by and is the responsibility of management.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has neither examined, compiled, nor performed any procedures with respect to the fair values or the calculation of net asset value per common\nshare, which utilizes information that is not disclosed within the financial statements, and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect\nthereto.\n56\nTable of Content\nAs of December 31, 2023, we estimate the NAV per common share to be $19.06. A reconciliation of NAV to total equity, which we believe is the most directly-comparable\nGAAP measure, is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per-share data):\nTotal equity per balance sheet $ 719,613\nFair value adjustment for long-term assets:\nLess: net cost basis of tangible and intangible real estate holdings(1) $ (1,340,092)\nPlus: estimated fair value of real estate holdings(2) 1,566,474\nNet fair value adjustment for real estate holdings 226,382\nFair value adjustment for long-term liabilities:\nPlus: book value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3) 637,214\nLess: fair value of aggregate long-term indebtedness(3)(4) (586,722)\nNet fair value adjustment for long-term indebtedness 50,492\nEstimated NAV $ 996,487\nLess: aggregate fair value of cumulative redeemable preferred stock(5) (313,524)\nEstimated NAV available to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders $ 682,963\nTotal common shares and non-controlling OP Units outstanding 35,838,442\nEstimated NAV per common share and OP Unit $ 19.06\n(1) Per Net Cost Basis as presented in the table above.\n(2) Per Current Fair Value as presented in the table above.\n(3) Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of notes and bonds payable) and the Series D Term Preferred Stock.\n(4) Long-term notes and bonds payable were valued using a discounted cash flow model. The Series D Term Preferred Stock was valued based on its closing stock price as of December 31, 2023.\n(5) The Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock were valued based on their respective closing stock prices as of December 31, 2023, while the Series E Preferred Stock was valued at its\nliquidation value, as discussed above.\nA quarterly rollforward in the estimated NAV per common share and OP Unit for the three months ended December 31, 2023, is provided below:\nEstimated NAV per common share and non-controlling OP Unit as of September 30, 2023 $ 20.33\nLess net loss attributable to common stockholders and non-controlling OP Unitholders (0.12)\nAdjustments for net change in valuations:\nNet change in unrealized fair value of farmland portfolio(1) $ (0.12)\nNet change in unrealized fair value of long-term indebtedness (0.35)\nNet change in unrealized fair value of preferred equity securities (0.46)\nNet change in valuations (0.93)\nLess distributions on common stock and non-controlling OP Units (0.14)\nLess net dilutive effect of equity issuances and redemptions, net (0.08)\nEstimated NAV per common share and non-controlling OP Unit as of December 31, 2023 $ 19.06\n(1) The net change in unrealized fair value of our farmland portfolio consists of three components: (i) a decrease of $0.43 per share due to the net depreciation in value of the farms that were valued during the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023, (ii) an increase of $0.27 per share due to the aggregate depreciation and amortization expense recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2023, and\n(iii) an increase of $0.04 per share due to net asset dispositions or capital improvements made on certain farms that have not yet been considered in the determination of the respective farms’ estimated fair\nvalues.\nComparison of estimated NAV and estimated NAV per common share, using the definitions above, to similarly-titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be\nmeaningful due to possible differences in the calculation or application of the definition of NAV used by such REITs. In addition, the trading price of our common shares may\ndiffer significantly from our most recent estimated NAV per common share calculation. For example, while we estimated our NAV per common share to be $19.06 as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on the calculation above, the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2023, was $14.45 per share.\nThe determination of estimated NAV is subjective and involves a number of assumptions, judgments, and estimates, and minor adjustments to these assumptions, judgments, or\nestimates may have a material impact on our overall portfolio valuation. In addition, many of the assumptions used are sensitive to market conditions and can change frequently.\nChanges in the market environment and other events that may occur during our ownership of these properties may cause the values reported above to vary from the actual fair\nvalue that may be obtained in the open market. Further, while management believes the values presented reflect current market conditions, the ultimate amount realized on any\nasset will be based on the timing of such\n57\nTable of Content\ndispositions and the then-current market conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate realized value upon disposition of an asset will approximate the estimated fair\nvalue above.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nITEM 7A.\nMarket risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, and other market changes that affect\nmarket-sensitive instruments. The primary market risk that we believe we are and will be exposed to is interest rate risk. Certain of our existing leases contain escalations based\non market indices, such as the consumer price index (“CPI”), and while very little of our existing borrowings are subject to variable interest rates, the interest rates on the\nmajority of our fixed-rate borrowings are fixed for a finite period before converting to variable rate. Although we seek to mitigate this risk by including certain provisions in\nmany of our leases, such as escalation clauses or adjusting the rent to prevailing market rents at various intervals, these features do not eliminate this risk.\nCurrently, over 99.9% of our borrowings are at fixed rates, and on a weighted-average basis, these rates are fixed at an effective interest rate (after interest patronage) of 3.34%\nfor another 4.2 years. As such, with respect to our current borrowings, we believe fluctuations in interest rates would have a minimal impact on our net income. However,\ninterest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings outstanding (excluding our\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock) was approximately $529.4 million.\nThe following table summarizes the hypothetical change in fair value of our fixed-rate borrowings at December 31, 2023, if market interest rates had been one or two percentage\npoints lower or higher than those in place as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nChange in Market Interest Rates Carrying Value(1) Fair Value Difference\n2% decrease $ 576,839 $ 562,496 $ (14,343)\n1% decrease 576,839 545,510 (31,329)\nNo change 576,839 529,366 (47,473)\n1% increase 576,839 514,021 (62,818)\n2% increase 576,839 499,421 (77,418)\n(1) Includes the principal balances outstanding of all long-term borrowings (consisting of notes and bonds payable), excluding unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIn the future, we may be exposed to additional effects of interest rate changes, primarily as a result of additional borrowings used to maintain liquidity and fund expansion of\nour farmland investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to\nlower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or, in limited cases, at variable rates with the lowest margins available and,\nwhere available, with the ability to convert to fixed rates in the future. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps and caps, to mitigate\nthe interest rate risk on a related financial instrument. We will not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.\nIn addition to changes in interest rates, the fair value of our farmland portfolio is subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes\nin the creditworthiness of our tenants. Materially adverse changes in the fair value of our real estate may affect our ability to refinance our debt, if necessary.\n58\nTable of Content\nITEM 8.

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and\nprocedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and the dispositions of our assets, provide reasonable\nassurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our\nreceipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective\ncan provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework\nin Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO). Based on our assessment, management concluded that our\ninternal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public\naccounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nFebruary 20, 2024\n60\nTable of Content\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Gladstone Land Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Gladstone Land Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023,\nincluding the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have\naudited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment\nof the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We\nare a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well\nas evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control\nbased on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;\nand (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\n61\nTable of Content\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken\nas a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nit relates.\nReal Estate Impairment Evaluation – Undiscounted Future Cash Flows\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated total real estate, net balance was $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. As\nof December 31, 2023, management concluded that none of the properties were impaired. Management periodically reviews the carrying value of each property to determine\nwhether indicators of impairment exist. If circumstances support the possibility of impairment, management prepares a projection of the total undiscounted future cash flows of\nthe specific property (without interest charges), including net proceeds from disposition, if any, and compares them to the net book value of the property to determine whether\nthe carrying value of the property is recoverable. In preparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows, management estimates cap rates, rental rates, and property\nvalues, as applicable, using information obtained from market data and other comparable sources, such as recent sales data from comparable properties and broker quotes, and\napplies the undiscounted cash flows to the expected hold period. If impairment is indicated, the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value based on\nmanagement’s best estimate of the property’s discounted future cash flows using market-derived terms, such as cap rates, discount rates, and rental rates applied to the expected\nhold period.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the undiscounted future cash flows used in the real estate impairment evaluation is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the projection of the undiscounted future cash flows and (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the cap rates, rental rates, property values, and\nexpected hold periods.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s real estate impairment evaluation, including controls over the projection of the\nundiscounted future cash flows. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the projection of the undiscounted future cash\nflows; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the undiscounted cash flow model; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the undiscounted cash flow\nmodel; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to cap rates, rental rates, property values, and expected hold periods.\nEvaluating management’s assumptions related to the cap rates, rental rates, property values, and expected hold periods involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by\nmanagement were reasonable considering (i) the consistency with external market and industry data and (ii) whether the rental rates assumption was consistent with evidence\nobtained in other areas of the audit.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nWashington, District of Columbia\nFebruary 20, 2024\nWe have

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReferences to the number of farms/properties, acreage, and primary crop use are unaudited.\nNOTE 1. BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION\nBusiness\nGladstone Land Corporation (“we,” “us,” or the “Company”) is an agricultural real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that was re-incorporated in Maryland on March 24, 2011,\nhaving been originally incorporated in California on June 14, 1997. We are primarily in the business of owning and leasing farmland. Subject to certain restrictions and\nlimitations, and pursuant to contractual agreements, our business is managed by Gladstone Management Corporation (the “Adviser”), a Delaware corporation, and\nadministrative services are provided to us by Gladstone Administration, LLC (the “Administrator”), a Delaware limited liability company. Our Adviser and Administrator are\nboth affiliates of ours (see Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions,” for additional discussion regarding our Adviser and Administrator).\nOrganization\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations through a subsidiary, Gladstone Land Limited Partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership. As we\ncurrently control the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and own, directly or indirectly, a majority of the common units of limited partnership interest in the\nOperating Partnership (“OP Units”), the financial position and results of operations of the Operating Partnership are consolidated within our financial statements. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company owned approximately 100.0%, 100.0%, and 99.4%, respectively, of the outstanding OP Units (see Note 8, “Equity,” for\nadditional discussion regarding OP Units).\nGladstone Land Partners, LLC (“Land Partners”), a Delaware limited liability company and a subsidiary of ours, was organized to engage in any lawful act or activity for which\na limited liability company may be organized in Delaware. Land Partners is the general partner of the Operating Partnership and has the power to make and perform all contracts\nand to engage in all activities necessary in carrying out the purposes of the Company, as well as all other powers available to it as a limited liability company. As we currently\nown all of the membership interests of Land Partners, the financial position and results of operations of Land Partners are consolidated within our financial statements.\nGladstone Land Advisers, Inc. (“Land Advisers”), a Delaware corporation and a subsidiary of ours, was created to collect any non-qualifying income related to our real estate\nportfolio and to perform certain small-scale farming business operations. We have elected for Land Advisers to be taxed as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) of ours. Since we\ncurrently own all of the voting securities of Land Advisers, its financial position and results of operations are consolidated within our financial statements. For the tax years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, there was no taxable income or loss from Land Advisers, nor did we have any undistributed REIT taxable income.\nAll further references herein to “we,” “us,” “our,” and the “Company” refer, collectively, to Gladstone Land Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except where\nindicated otherwise.\nNOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. Actual results may materially differ from these estimates.\nReal Estate and Lease Intangibles\nOur investments in real estate consist of farmland, improvements made to the farmland (consisting primarily of irrigation and drainage systems and buildings), and permanent\nplantings acquired in connection with certain land purchases (consisting primarily of almond and pistachio trees, blueberry bushes, and wine vineyards). We record investments\nin real estate at cost and generally capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. We expense costs of\nroutine repairs and maintenance as such costs are incurred. We generally compute depreciation using the\n68\nTable of Content\nstraight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or 50 years for buildings, improvements, and permanent plantings, and the shorter of the estimated useful life or\n5 to 20 years for equipment and fixtures.\nCertain of our acquisitions involve sale-leaseback transactions with newly-originated leases, and other of our acquisitions involve the acquisition of farmland that was already\nbeing operated as rental property, in which case we will typically assume the lease in place at the time of acquisition. Most of our acquisitions, including those with a prior\nleasing history, are generally treated as asset acquisitions under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”).\nASC 805 requires that the purchase price of real estate be allocated to (i) the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed (typically consisting of land, buildings,\nimprovements, permanent plantings, and long-term debt) and, if applicable, (ii) any identifiable intangible assets and liabilities (typically consisting of in-place lease values,\nlease origination costs, the values of above- and below-market leases, and tenant relationships), based in each case on their fair values. In addition, all acquisition-related costs\n(other than legal costs incurred directly related to either originating new leases we execute upon acquisition or reviewing in-place leases we assumed upon acquisition) are\ncapitalized and included as part of the fair value allocation of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired or liabilities assumed.\nManagement’s estimates of fair value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers, such as a sales comparison approach, a cost approach, and either\nan income capitalization approach or discounted cash flow analysis. Factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical,\nexpected lease-up periods, taking into consideration current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each property as\na result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In\nestimating carrying costs, management also includes lost reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance, and certain other operating expenses, as well as estimates of lost rental\nincome at market rates during the hypothetical, expected lease-up periods, which typically range from 1 to 24 months, depending on specific local market conditions.\nManagement also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, legal fees, and other related expenses, to the extent that such costs are not already\nincurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. While management believes these estimates to be reasonable based on the information available at\nthe time of acquisition, the purchase price allocation may be adjusted if management obtains more information regarding the valuations of the assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed.\nWe allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The “as-if-vacant” value\nis allocated to land, buildings, improvements, and permanent plantings, based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of such assets and liabilities as of the\ndate of acquisition.\nWe record above- and below-market lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases\nacquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease agreements, and (ii) management’s estimate of fair market lease rates for\nthe corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining, non-cancelable term of the lease. When determining the non-cancelable term of the lease, we\nevaluate whether fixed-rate or below-market renewal options, if any, should be included. The fair value of capitalized above-market lease values, included as part of Other assets\nin the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, is amortized as a reduction of rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining, non-cancelable terms of the\nrespective leases. The fair value of capitalized below-market lease values, included as part of Other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, is amortized as\nan increase to rental income on a straight-line basis over the remaining, non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, including that of any fixed-price or below-market renewal\noptions.\nThe value of the remaining intangible assets acquired, which consists of in-place lease values, lease origination costs, and tenant relationship values, are determined based on\nmanagement’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant. Characteristics to be considered by\nmanagement in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, prospects for developing additional business with the\ntenant, the tenant’s credit quality, and our expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the current lease agreement), among other factors.\nThe value of in-place leases and certain lease origination costs (if any) are amortized to amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining, non-cancelable terms of\nthe respective leases. The value of tenant relationship intangibles, which is the benefit to us resulting from the likelihood of an existing tenant renewing its lease at the existing\nproperty or entering into a lease at a different property we own, is amortized to amortization expense over the remaining lease term and any anticipated renewal periods in the\nrespective leases.\nShould a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the above intangible assets or liabilities would be charged to the appropriate income or expense account.\n69\nTable of Content\nTotal consideration for acquisitions may include a combination of cash and equity securities, such as OP Units. When OP Units are issued in connection with acquisitions, we\ndetermine the fair value of the OP Units issued based on the number of units issued multiplied by the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of acquisition.\nReal Estate Impairment Evaluation\nWe account for the impairment of our real estate assets in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” (“ASC 360”), which requires us to periodically review\nthe carrying value of each property to determine whether indicators of impairment exist or if depreciation periods should be modified. In determining if impairment exists, we\nconsider such indicators which may include, but are not limited to, deteriorating market conditions, declines in a property’s operating performance due to near-term lease\nmaturities or vacancy rates, environmental damage, including due to natural disasters or tenant neglect, legal concerns, and whether our hold period has shortened. If\ncircumstances support the possibility of impairment, we prepare a projection of the total undiscounted future cash flows of the specific property (without interest charges),\nincluding net proceeds from disposition, if any, and compare them to the net book value of the property to determine whether the carrying value of the property is recoverable. In\npreparing the projection of undiscounted future cash flows, we estimate cap rates, rental rates, and property values, as applicable, using information that we obtain from market\ndata and other comparable sources, such as recent sales data from comparable properties and broker quotes, and apply the undiscounted cash flows to our expected holding\nperiod. If impairment is indicated, the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value based on our best estimate of the property’s discounted future\ncash flows using market-derived terms, such as cap rates, discount rates, and rental rates applied to our expected hold period.\nUsing the methodology discussed above, we evaluated our entire portfolio for any impairment indicators and performed an impairment analysis on select properties that had an\nindication of impairment. As of December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we concluded that none of our properties were impaired. There have been no impairments\nrecognized on our real estate assets since our inception. We will continue to monitor our portfolio for any other indicators of impairment.\nHeld-for-Sale Property\nFor properties classified as held-for-sale, we cease depreciating and amortizing the property and related intangible assets and value the property at the lower of depreciated and\namortized cost or fair value, less costs to dispose. If the sale meets the definition of discontinued operations, we present the related assets, liabilities, and results of operations\nthat have been sold (or that otherwise qualify as held-for-sale) as discontinued operations in all periods. The definition of discontinued operations is met if the disposal of a\ncomponent or group of components either meets the held-for-sale criteria or is disposed of and also represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our\noperations and financial results. If classified as such, the components of the property’s net income (loss) that are reflected as discontinued operations include operating results,\ndepreciation, amortization, and interest expense.\nWhen properties are considered held-for-sale, but do not qualify as a discontinued operation, we present such assets and liabilities as held for sale on the consolidated balance\nsheet in all periods that the related assets and liabilities meet the held-for-sale criteria under ASC 360. Components of the held-for-sale property’s net income (loss) are\nrecorded within continuing operations on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nTenant Improvements\nFrom time to time, our tenants may pay for improvements on certain of our properties with the ownership of the improvements remaining with us, in which case we will record\nthe cost of such improvements as an asset (tenant-funded improvements, included within Investments in real estate, net), along with a corresponding liability (deferred rent\nliability, included within Other liabilities, net) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. When we are determined to be the owner of the tenant-funded improvements, such\nimprovements will be depreciated over the useful life in accordance with our depreciation policy noted above, and the related deferred rent liability will be amortized as an\naddition to rental income over the remaining term of the existing lease in place. If the tenant is determined to be the owner of a tenant improvement funded by us, such amounts\nare treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining term of the existing lease in place.\nIn determining whether the tenant or the Company is the owner of such improvements, several factors will be considered, including, but not limited to: (i) whether the\nimprovement’s useful life is greater than the remaining lease term plus any reasonably certain renewal options; (ii) whether the lease allows the tenant to remove the\nimprovements; (iii) whether the improvement is unique to the tenant or useful to subsequent tenants; (iv) whether the improvement adds value to the property or increases the\nlifespan of the property; and (v) whether the tenant was provided a form of reimbursement or incentive concerning the improvement. The determination of who owns the\nimprovements can be subject to significant judgment.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n70\nTable of Content\nWe consider cash equivalents to be all short-term, highly-liquid investments that are both readily convertible to cash and have a maturity of three months or less at the time of\npurchase, except that any such investments purchased with funds held in escrow or similar accounts are classified as restricted cash. Items classified as cash equivalents include\nmoney-market deposit accounts. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were held in the custody of one financial institution (which management\nbelieves to be financially sound and with minimal credit risk), and our balance at times may exceed federally-insurable limits. We did not have any restricted cash or restricted\ncash equivalents as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs consist of costs incurred to obtain debt financing, including legal fees, origination fees, and administrative fees. Costs associated with our long-term\nborrowings and term preferred stock securities required to be recorded net of the respective debt for GAAP purposes are deferred and amortized over the terms of the respective\nfinancings using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. In the case of our lines of credit, the straight-line method is used due to the\nrevolving nature of the financing instrument. Upon early extinguishment of any borrowings, the unamortized portion of the related deferred financing costs will be immediately\ncharged to expense. In addition, in accordance with ASC 470, “Debt” (“ASC 470”), when a financing arrangement is amended so that the only material change is an increase in\nthe borrowing capacity, the unamortized deferred financing costs from the prior arrangement are amortized over the term of the new arrangement. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded approximately $1.1 million, $1.1 million, and $1.2 million, respectively, of total amortization expense related to debt issuance\ncosts.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nWe account for offering costs in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5.A., which states that incremental offering costs directly attributable to a proposed or\nactual offering of securities may be deferred and charged against the gross proceeds of such offering. Accordingly, costs incurred related to our ongoing equity offerings are\nincluded in Other assets, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are ratably applied to the cost of equity as the related securities are issued. If an equity\noffering is subsequently terminated, the remaining, unallocated portion of the related deferred offering costs are charged to expense in the period such offering is aborted and\nrecorded on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nOther Assets and Other Liabilities\nOther assets, net generally consists primarily of net deferred rent assets, rents receivable, deferred offering costs, prepaid expenses, deferred financing costs associated with our\nlines of credit, operating lease right-of-use assets, deposits on potential real estate acquisitions, the carrying value of certain farm equipment owned by us and used on our\nfarms, investments in long-term water assets (see “—Investments in Water Assets” below for further discussion), net ownership interests in special-purpose LLCs (see “—\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities” below for further discussion), and the fair value of interest rate swaps if market interest rates are above the fixed rate of the respective\nswap (see Note 4, “Borrowings—Interest Rate Swap Agreements,” for further discussion).\nOther liabilities, net generally consists primarily of rents received in advance, net deferred rent liabilities, operating lease liabilities, and the fair value of interest rate swaps if\nmarket interest rates are below the fixed rate of the respective swap (see Note 4, “Borrowings—Interest Rate Swap Agreements,” for further discussion).\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nWe determine if an entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in accordance with ASC Topic 810, “Consolidation.” For an entity in which we have acquired an interest, the\nentity will be considered a VIE if either of the following characteristics are met: (i) the entity lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated\nfinancial support, or (ii) equity holders, as a group, lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. We evaluate all significant investments in real estate-related assets\nto determine if they are VIEs, utilizing judgment and estimates that are inherently subjective.\nIf an entity is determined to be a VIE, we then determine whether to consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both (i) the power to direct\nthe activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that\ncould potentially be significant to the entity.\nSee Note 3, “Real Estate and Lease Intangibles—Investments in Unconsolidated Entities,” for further discussion.\nInvestments in Water Assets\n71\nTable of Content\nFrom time to time, we have entered into contracts to acquire additional water assets for certain of our farms (see Note 3, R“eal Estate and Lease Intangibles—Investments in\nWater Assets”). The water assets acquired may be in the form of either water banked at a government municipality or groundwater pumping credits obtained through\ngroundwater recharge programs established by government municipalities, which recharge is achieved via groundwater recharge facilities we have constructed on certain of our\nfarms. The contracts we have entered into to acquire additional water assets cannot readily be net settled by means outside of the respective contracts; therefore, in accordance\nwith ASC 360, we recognize the investments in long-term water assets at cost, including all costs necessary to procure and transfer the water asset to its intended location. Costs\nto acquire water assets are initially deferred in a prepaid account until such time that the water assets are recognized by the respective water district, at which time, the costs\nrelated to the recognized water assets are reclassed and capitalized as an investment in long-term water assets. Investments in long-term water assets and the related prepaid\nasset are both included in Other assets, net on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. While we may, in the future, sell portions of these water assets to unrelated third\nparties for a profit, our current intent is to hold these water assets for the long-term for future use on our farms. There is no amount of time by which we must use these water\nassets.\nEach quarter, we will review our investments in long-term water assets for any indicators of impairment in accordance with ASC 360 and perform an impairment analysis if\nthere are any such indicators. In determining if impairment exists, we consider such indicators which may include, but are not limited to, deteriorating market conditions and\nenvironmental or regulatory changes. As of December 31, 2023, we concluded that there were no such indicators and that the water assets were not impaired.\nNon-controlling Interests\nNon-controlling limited interests in our Operating Partnership are those OP Units not owned by us. We evaluate whether OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders are\nsubject to redemption features outside of our control. OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders are redeemable at the option of the holder for cash or, at our election,\nshares of our common stock and thus are reported in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets but separate from stockholders’ equity. The amount reported for such\nnon-controlling interests on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income represent the portion of income (loss) from the Operating Partnership not\nattributable to us. At the end of each reporting period, we determine the amount of equity (at book value) that is allocable to non-controlling interests based upon the respective\nownership interests. To reflect such non-controlling interests’ equity interest in the Company, an adjustment is made to non-controlling interests, with a corresponding\nadjustment to paid-in capital, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Equity.\nLease Revenue\nLease revenue includes rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease, reported evenly over the non-cancelable term of the lease. Most of our\nleases contain rental increases at specified intervals, which we recognize on a straight-line basis. For leases that are deemed not probable of collection, revenue is recorded as\nthe lesser of (i) the amount that would be recognized on a straight-line basis or (ii) cash that has been received from the tenant (including deferred revenue), with any receivable\nbalances (including deferred rent receivables) charged as a direct write-off against lease revenue in the period of the change in the collectability determination. If the\ncollectability determination for leases for which revenue is being recorded based on cash received from the tenant subsequently changes to being probable, we resume\nrecognizing revenue, including deferred revenue, on a straight-line basis and recognize incremental revenue related to the reinstatement of cumulative deferred rent receivable\nand deferred revenue balances as if revenue had been recorded on a straight-line basis since the inception of the lease. As of December 31, 2023, three of our leases with two\ndifferent tenants were recognized on a cash basis due to the full collectability of the remaining rental payments under the respective leases not being deemed probable. Certain\nother leases provide for additional rental payments that are based on a percentage of the gross crop revenues earned on the farm, which we refer to as participation rents. Such\ncontingent revenue is generally recognized when all contingencies have been resolved and when actual results become known or estimable, enabling us to estimate and/or\nmeasure our share of such gross revenues. As a result, depending on the circumstances of each lease, certain participation rents may be recognized by us in the year the crop was\nharvested, while other participation rents may be recognized in the year following the harvest.\nDeferred rent receivable, included in Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue as recorded on\na straight-line basis and cash rents received from the tenants in accordance with the lease terms. In addition, we determine, in our judgment, to what extent the deferred rent\nreceivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectable. We perform a quarterly review of the net deferred rent receivable balance as it relates to straight-line rents and take\ninto consideration the tenant’s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions of the industry in which the tenant operates, and economic and\nagricultural conditions in the geographic area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of deferred rent with respect to any given tenant is in doubt, we\nrecord a direct write-off of the specific rent receivable, with a corresponding adjustment to lease revenue.\n72\nTable of Content\nTenant recovery revenue includes payments received from tenants as reimbursements for certain operating expenses, such as property taxes, insurance premiums, and water\ndelivery costs. These expenses and their subsequent reimbursements are recognized under property operating expenses as incurred and lease revenue as earned, respectively, and\nare recorded in the same periods. We generally do not record any lease revenue or property operating expenses associated with costs paid directly by our tenants for net-leased\nproperties.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue consists of non-lease revenue generated as a result of activities performed on certain of our properties. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we\nrecognized approximately $79,000 of non-cash revenue, in the form of water credits, associated with the transfer and storing of surplus water on behalf of a government\nmunicipality using a groundwater recharge facility constructed on one of our farms. The timing of revenue recognition generally occurs once water credits are recognized by the\nrespective water district at the estimated fair value of the resulting water credits. See Note 3, “Real Estate and Intangible Assets—Investments in Water Assets,” for further\ndiscussion.\nGain (loss) on Dispositions of Real Estate Assets\nWe recognize net gains (losses) on dispositions of real estate assets either upon the abandonment of an asset before the end of its useful life or upon the closing of a transaction\n(be it an outright sale of a property or the sale of a perpetual, right-of-way easement on all or a portion of a property) with the purchaser. When a real estate asset is abandoned\nprior to the end of its useful life, a loss is recorded in an amount equal to the net book value of the related real estate asset at the time of abandonment. In the case of a sale of a\nproperty, a gain (loss) is recorded to the extent that the total consideration received for a property is more (less) than the property’s net carrying value, plus any closing costs\nincurred, at the time of the sale. Gains are recognized using the full accrual method (i.e., when the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured, we are not obligated to\nperform additional activities that may be considered significant, the initial investment from the buyer is sufficient, and other profit recognition criteria have been satisfied).\nGains on sales of real estate assets may be deferred in whole or in part until the requirements for gain recognition have been met.\nOther Income\nWe record non-operating and unusual or infrequent income as Other income on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Other income recorded for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was primarily from interest patronage received on certain of our long-term borrowings and interest earned on short-term investments.\nInvoluntary Conversions and Property and Casualty Recovery\nWe account for involuntary conversions, for example, when a nonmonetary asset, such as property or equipment, is involuntarily converted to a monetary asset, such as\ninsurance proceeds, in accordance with ASC 605, “Revenue Recognition,” which requires us to recognize a gain or a loss equal to the difference between the carrying amount\nof the nonmonetary asset and the amount of monetary assets received. Further, in accordance with ASC 450, “Contingencies,” recovery of the loss is considered to be probable,\nwe will recognize a receivable for the amount expected to be covered by insurance proceeds, not to exceed the related loss recognized, unless such amounts have been realized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have operated and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify as a REIT under the Sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended (the “Code”). Beginning with our tax year ended December 31, 2013, we elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, and Land Advisers has been\ntreated as a wholly-owned TRS that is subject to federal and state income taxes.\nAs a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal corporate income taxes on amounts that we distribute to our stockholders (except income from any foreclosure property),\nprovided that, on an annual basis, we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (excluding net capital gains) to our stockholders and meet certain other conditions. To\nthe extent that we satisfy the annual distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains), we will be subject to corporate\nincome tax on our undistributed taxable income. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular\ncorporate rates (including any alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four immediately-subsequent taxable years. Even as a REIT, we may\nbe subject to certain state and local income and property taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. In general, however, as long as we\nqualify as a REIT, no provision for federal income taxes will be necessary, except for taxes on undistributed REIT taxable income and taxes on the income generated by a TRS\n(such as Land Advisers), if any.\n73\nTable of Content\nShould we have any taxable income or loss in the future, we will account for any income taxes in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” (“ASC 740”),\nusing the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts\nof existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis (including for operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards) and are calculated using the\nenacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. In addition, we will establish valuation allowances for tax benefits when we believe\nit is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that such assets will not be realized.\nWe perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements. An\nuncertain tax position is defined as a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that is not based on clear and unambiguous tax law and which is reflected in measuring\ncurrent or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had no provisions for uncertain tax positions. The\nprior three tax years remain open for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service.\nComprehensive Income\nWe record the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges to accumulated other comprehensive income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we reconciled net income attributable to the Company to comprehensive income attributable to the Company on the\naccompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nSegment Reporting\nWe manage our operations on an aggregated, single-segment basis for purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions and, accordingly, have onlyo ne\nreporting and operating segment.\nRecently-Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no recently-issued accounting pronouncements that had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3. REAL ESTATE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nAll of our properties are wholly-owned on a fee-simple basis, except where noted.

No new lease was executed related to this acquisition.\n(4) Represents the acquisition of a parcel of farmable land adjacent to an existing farm. Subsequent to acquisition, we spent approximately $153,000 to install certain improvements on this property.\n(5) Upon acquisition, we executed three new leases with the existing tenants on these farms. The lease terms above represent the weighted-average lease term and aggregate annualized straight-line rent of these\nthree leases.\n(6) In connection with the acquisition of this property, we also acquired an ownership interest in a related LLC, the sole purpose of which is to own and maintain an irrigation system providing water to this and\nother neighboring properties. Our acquired ownership, which equated to an 11.3% interest in the LLC, was valued at approximately $2.7 million at the time of acquisition and is included within Other\nassets, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. See “—Investments in Unconsolidated Entities” below for additional information on our aggregate ownership interest in this and other LLCs.\n(7) These two properties were acquired as part of a single transaction. In connection with the acquisition of these vineyards, we committed to provide up to an aggregate amount of $2.2 million for certain\nirrigation and vineyard improvements on these farms, for which we will earn additional rent as the funds are disbursed by us.\n(8) Represents the acquisition of three parcels of land adjacent to an existing farm that will initially be utilized for its water rights (including additional surface water rights and groundwater pumping rights) to\nbe used on nearby farms. In addition, a portion of this acquisition was leased back to the seller.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, in the aggregate, we recognized operating revenues of approximately $2.1 million and net income of approximately $244,000 related\nto the above acquisitions.\nPurchase Price Allocations\nThe allocation of the aggregate purchase price for the farms acquired during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAssets (Liabilities) Acquired 2022 Acquisitions\nLand and land improvements $ 30,353\nPermanent plantings 24,706\nIrrigation & drainage systems 3,102\nFarm-related facilities 1,287\nIn-place lease values 909\nLeasing costs 1,355\nAbove-market lease values(1) 641\nInvestment in LLC(1) 2,749\nTotal Purchase Price $ 65,102\n(1) Included within Other assets, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAcquired Intangibles and Liabilities\nThe following table shows the weighted-average amortization periods (in years) for the intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with new real estate\nacquired during the year ended December 31, 2022:\n77\nTable of Content\nWeighted-Average\nAmortization Period (in Years)\nIntangible Assets and Liabilities 2022\nLeasehold interest – land 0.0\nIn-place lease values 10.9\nLeasing costs 11.7\nAbove-market lease values and lease incentives 9.1\nBelow-market lease values and other deferred revenue 0.0\nAll intangible assets and liabilities 10.6\nProperty Sale\nOn June 23, 2023, we completed the sale of a 138-acre parcel of unfarmed land in Florida for $9.6 million. Including closing costs, we recognized a net gain on the sale of\napproximately $6.4 million.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nIn connection with the acquisition of certain farmland located in Fresno County, California, we also acquired an ownership in a related limited liability company (the “Fresno\nLLC”), the sole purpose of which is to own and maintain a pipeline conveying water to our and other neighboring properties. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of\ncertain farmland located in Umatilla County, Oregon, we also acquired an ownership in a related limited liability company (the “Umatilla LLC”), the sole purpose of which is to\nown and maintain an irrigation system providing water to our and other neighboring properties.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our aggregate ownership interest in the Fresno LLC and the Umatilla LLC was5 0.00% and 20.4%, respectively. As our investments in the Fresno\nLLC and Umatilla LLC are both deemed to constitute “significant influence,” we have accounted for these investments under the equity method.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded an aggregate loss of approximately $59,000, $73,000, and $61,000, respectively (included in Loss\nfrom investments in unconsolidated entities on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income), which represents our pro-rata share of the aggregate\nloss recognized by the Fresno LLC and Umatilla LLC. As of both December 31, 2023 and 2022, our combined ownership interest in the Fresno LLC and Umatilla LLC had an\naggregate carrying value of approximately $5.8 million and is included within Other assets, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInvestments in Water Assets\nIn connection with the acquisition of certain farmland located in Kern County, California, we also acquired three contracts to purchase an aggregate of 45,000 acre-feet of\nbanked water held by Semitropic Water Storage District (“SWSD”), a water storage district located in Kern County, California. We subsequently executed all three contracts to\npurchase all 45,000 acre-feet of banked water for an aggregate additional cost of approximately $2.8 million. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, we\nobtained another contract to purchase an additional 1,003 acre-feet of banked water held by SWSD, which was received from one of our tenants as partial consideration for a\nrent payment owed. We subsequently executed the contract to purchase all 1,003 acre-feet of banked water for an aggregate cost of approximately $61,000.\nAll acquired banked water was recognized at cost, including the subsequent cost to execute the contracts and any administrative fees necessary to transfer the water to our\nbanked water account. As of December 31, 2023, the 46,003 acre-feet of banked water held by SWSD was recognized as a long-term water asset and had an aggregate carrying\nvalue of approximately $34.5 million (included within Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets).\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we elected to participate in a groundwater recharge program established by Westlands Water District (“WWD”), a water\ndistrict located in Fresno County, California. Under the program, WWD will pay for surplus surface water to be delivered to individual landowners’ properties with district-\napproved groundwater recharge facilities, also known as “water banks.” The landowner would be allowed to keep 50% of the net amount of groundwater credits generated\nunder the program (after allowing for certain leave-behind and evaporative losses), and the remaining 50% would be used to recharge the aquifer and retained by WWD.\nDelivery of water under this program is subject to surplus water availability at WWD’s discretion, and WWD has not yet announced a termination date for this program.\nThrough December 31, 2023, we have obtained 397 water credits, which represents 50% of the total net water credits generated and confirmed by WWD under the program as\nof December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, these water credits were recognized as a long-term water asset and had an aggregate carrying value of approximately\n$111,000 (included within Other assets, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets).\n78\nTable of Content\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we also entered into various other agreements with certain third parties (including local water districts and private individuals) to\neither buy water directly, buy a portion of other water districts’ surface water allocations in future years in which allocations are granted, or to store surface water on others’\nbehalf in one of our groundwater recharge facilities in exchange for a portion of the net groundwater credits produced and recognized by the respective water district.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we owned a total of4 6,400 acre-feet and 45,000 acre-feet, respectively, of long-term water assets, and our investments in these long-term\nwater assets had an aggregate carrying value of approximately $34.6 million and $34.0 million, respectively, and are included within Other assets, net on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\nWe have invested approximately $1.8 million to construct groundwater recharge facilities on two of our farms, which is included within Real estate, at cost on our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. In addition, through December 31, 2023, we have invested an additional $1.8 million in the aggregate in connection with these agreements that are expected to\nresult in additional groundwater credits in the future; however, the amount and timing of these credits, if any, is currently unknown and is dependent upon and subject to the\nrecognition of such credits by the respective water districts, in their sole discretion. Such costs are held in a deferred asset account (also included within Other assets, net on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets) until the related net water credits become estimable and are recognized by the respective water district, at which time the costs would be reclassed\nto investments in long-term water assets.\nFuture Minimum Lease Payments\nWe account for all of our leasing arrangements in which we are the lessor as operating leases. The majority of our leases are subject to fixed rental increases, and a small subset\nof our lease portfolio includes lease payments based on an index, such as the consumer price index (“CPI”). In addition, several of our leases contain participation rent\ncomponents based on the gross revenues earned on the respective farms. Most of our leases also include tenant renewal options; however, these renewal options are generally\nbased on then-current market rental rates and are therefore typically excluded from the determination of the minimum lease term. The majority of our leases generally do not\ninclude tenant termination options.\nThe following tables summarize the future lease payments to be received under noncancellable leases as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nTenant\nPeriod Lease Revenue\nFor the fiscal years ending December 31, 2024 $ 77,576\n2025 70,372\n2026 63,954\n2027 60,099\n2028 51,482\nThereafter 180,832\n$ 504,315\nLeases—Cash Basis Recognition\nAs of December 31, 2023, due to credit issues with two of our tenants, we determined that the full collectability of the remaining rental payments under the respective leases\nwith these tenants was not deemed to be probable. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized all or a portion of lease revenues from the three leases\nwith these two tenants (all farms located in California) on a cash basis. We are continuing to work with the current tenants and will seek to come to an agreement for the\nremaining rental payments, if possible. Such agreement, if one can be reached, may include placing these tenants on payment plans, deferring a portion of the rent owed to us,\nor agreeing to terminate the respective leases. In the event of a termination, we estimate that we would be able to find new tenants to lease each of these properties to at market\nrental rates within 1 to 12 months.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded lease revenues from theset hree leases of approximately $2.5 million (including approximately $72,000 of participation\nrents), as compared to approximately $3.1 million (including approximately $0.8 million of participation rents) and approximately $2.4 million (including approximately\n$95,000 of participation rents) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPortfolio Concentrations\nCredit Risk\n79\nTable of Content\nAs of December 31, 2023, our farms were leased to various different, unrelated third-party tenants, with certain tenants leasing more than one farm. No individual tenant\nrepresented greater than 10.0% of the total lease revenue recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nGeographic Risk\nFarms located in California and Florida accounted for approximately $59.1 million (65.5%) and $15.1 million (16.7%), respectively, of the total lease revenue recorded during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. We seek to continue to further diversify geographically, as may be desirable or feasible. If an unexpected natural disaster (such as an\nearthquake, wildfire, or flood) occurs or climate change impacts the regions where our properties are located, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial\nperformance and ability to continue operations. None of our farms in California or Florida were materially impacted by the wildfires, droughts, or hurricanes that occurred in\nthose respective regions during the year ended December 31, 2023. See “—California Floods” below for a discussion on damage caused on certain of our farms by the January\n2023 floods that occurred in California. Besides California and Florida, no other single state accounted for more than 10.0% of the total rental revenue recorded during the year\nended December 31, 2023.\n2023 California Floods\nIn January 2023, periods of heavy rainfall in California resulted in floods that impacted several areas of the state, including regions where certain of our farms are located. As a\nresult of the flooding, one of our farms in the Central Valley suffered damage to certain structures located on the farm, and we estimated the carrying value of the structures on\nthis property damaged by the floods to be approximately $855,000. As such, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we wrote down the carrying value of these structures\nand also recorded a corresponding property and casualty loss, included within Property and casualty (loss) recovery, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and\nComprehensive Income. Certain of our other farms in California suffered minor damage as a result of the floods, but no other farms were materially impacted.\nNOTE 4. BORROWINGS\nOur borrowings as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nCarrying Value as of As of December 31, 2023\nStated Interest\nRates(1) Maturity Dates\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 (Range; Wtd Avg) (Range; Wtd Avg)\nVariable-rate revolving lines of credit $ 200 $ 100 7.39% 12/15/2033\nNotes and bonds payable:\nFixed-rate notes payable $ 524,199 $ 550,974 2.45%–5.70%; 3.71% 9/1/2024–7/1/2051; April 2033\nVariable-rate notes payable — 1,104 N/A N/A\n01/12/2024–12/30/2030; August\nFixed-rate bonds payable 52,640 77,776 2.66%–4.57%; 3.64%\n2026\nTotal notes and bonds payable 576,839 629,854\nDebt issuance costs – notes and bonds payable (2,928) (3,454) N/A N/A\nNotes and bonds payable, net $ 573,911 $ 626,400\nTotal borrowings, net $ 574,111 $ 626,500\n(1) Where applicable, stated interest rates are before interest patronage (as described below).\nAs of December 31, 2023, the above borrowings were collateralized by certain of our farms with an aggregate net book value of approximately $1.1 billion. The weighted-\naverage interest rate charged on the above borrowings (excluding the impact of debt issuance costs and before any interest patronage, or refunded interest) was 3.79% and 3.77%\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, 2022 interest patronage from our Farm Credit Notes Payable (as defined below) resulted in a 24.1%\nreduction (approximately 109 basis points) to the stated interest rates on such borrowings. See below under “—Farm Credit Notes Payables—Interest Patronage” for further\ndiscussion on interest patronage.\nWe generally borrow at a rate of 60% of the value of the underlying agricultural real estate, and, except as noted herein, the amounts borrowed are not generally guaranteed by\nthe Company. Our loan agreements generally contain various affirmative and negative covenants, including with respect to liens, indebtedness, mergers, and asset sales, and\ncustomary events of default. These agreements may also require that we satisfy certain financial covenants at the end of each calendar quarter or year. Some of these financial\ncovenants include, but are not limited to, staying below a maximum leverage ratio and maintaining a\n80\nTable of Content\nminimum net worth value, rental-revenue-to-debt ratio, current ratio, and fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants\napplicable to the above borrowings.\nMetLife Facility\nOn February 3, 2022, we amended our credit facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MetLife”), which previously consisted of a $75.0 million long-term note\npayable (the “2020 MetLife Term Note”) and $75.0 million of revolving equity lines of credit (the “MetLife Lines of Credit,” and together with the 2020 MetLife Term Note,\nthe “Prior MetLife Facility”). Pursuant to the amendment, our credit facility with MetLife now consists of the 2020 MetLife Term Note, the MetLife Lines of Credit, and a new\n$100.0 million long-term note payable (the “2022 MetLife Term Note,” and together with the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the MetLife Lines of Credit, the “Current MetLife\nFacility”).\nOn December 14, 2023, we entered into an amendment with MetLife to extend the maturity dates of the MetLife Lines of Credit from April 5, 2024, to December 15, 2033. In\naddition, the amendment revised certain covenant thresholds and increased the minimum balance requirement on each line of credit. As part of this amendment, we paid\naggregate fees of approximately $188,000 to MetLife.\nThe following table summarizes the pertinent terms of the Current MetLife Facility as of December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except for footnotes):\nAggregate Maturity Principal Undrawn\nIssuance Commitment Dates Outstanding Interest Rate Terms Commitment(1)\nMetLife Lines of Credit $ 75,000 12/15/2033 $ 200 3M SOFR + 2.00% (2) $ 74,800\n2020 MetLife Term Note 75,000 (3) 1/5/2030 36,900 2.75%, fixed through 1/4/2030 (4) 38,100\n2022 MetLife Term Note 100,000 (3) 1/5/2032 — (4) 100,000\nTotals $ 250,000 $ 37,100 $ 212,900\n(1) Based on the properties that were pledged as collateral under the Current MetLife Facility, as of December 31, 2023, the maximum additional amount we could draw under the facility was approximately\n$110.2 million.\n(2) The interest rate on the MetLife Lines of Credit is subject to a minimum annualized rate of 2.50%, plus an unused fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20% on undrawn amounts (based on the balance drawn under\neach line of credit).\n(3) If the aggregate commitments under the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the 2022 MetLife Term Note are not fully utilized by December 31, 2024, MetLife has no obligation to disburse the additional funds\nunder either note.\n(4) Interest rates on future disbursements under each of the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the 2022 MetLife Term Note will be based on prevailing market rates at the time of such disbursements. In addition,\nthrough December 31, 2024, the 2020 MetLife Term Note and the 2022 MetLife Term Note are each subject to an unused fee ranging from 0.10% to 0.20% on undrawn amounts (based on the balance\ndrawn under the respective note).\nUnder the Current MetLife Facility, we are generally allowed to borrow up to 60% of the aggregate of the lower of cost or the appraised value of the pool of agricultural real\nestate pledged as collateral. Amounts owed to MetLife under the Current MetLife Facility are guaranteed by us and each subsidiary of ours that owns a property pledged as\ncollateral pursuant to the loan documents.\nFarmer Mac Facility\nThrough certain subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, we have entered into a bond purchase agreement (the “Bond Purchase Agreement”) with Federal Agricultural\nMortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”) and Farmer Mac Mortgage Securities Corporation (the “Bond Purchaser”) for a secured note purchase facility (the “Farmer Mac\nFacility”). As amended from time to time, the Farmer Mac Facility currently provides for bond issuances up to an aggregate amount of $225.0 million. Pursuant to the Bond\nPurchase Agreement, as further amended on June 2, 2023, we may issue new bonds under the Farmer Mac Facility through December 31, 2026, and the final maturity date for\nnew bonds issued under the facility will be the date that is ten years from the applicable issuance date. We did not issue any new bonds under the Farmer Mac Facility during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023.\nPursuant to the Bond Purchase Agreement, bonds issued by us to the Bond Purchaser will be secured by a security interest in loans originated by us (pursuant to a pledge and\nsecurity agreement), which, in turn, will be collateralized by first liens on agricultural real estate owned by subsidiaries of ours. The bonds issued generally have a maximum\naggregate, effective loan-to-value ratio of 60% of the underlying agricultural real estate, after giving effect to certain overcollateralization obligations. As of December 31,\n2023, we had approximately $52.6 million of bonds issued and outstanding under the Farmer Mac Facility.\nFarm Credit Notes Payable\nFrom time to time since September 2014, we, through certain subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, have entered into various loan agreements (collectively, the “Farm\nCredit Notes Payable”) with various different Farm Credit associations\n81\nTable of Content\n(collectively, “Farm Credit”). We did not enter into any new loan agreements with Farm Credit during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCertain amounts owed under the Farm Credit Notes Payable, limited to 12 months of principal and interest due under certain of the loans, are guaranteed by us pursuant to the\nrespective loan documents.\nInterest Patronage\nInterest patronage, or refunded interest, on our borrowings from Farm Credit is generally recorded upon receipt and is included within Other income on our Consolidated\nStatements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Receipt of interest patronage typically occurs in the first half of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the\nrespective interest expense is accrued.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded interest patronage of approximately $2.3 million related to interest accrued on the Farm Credit Notes Payable\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022, and during the three months ended September 30, 2022, we received approximately $113,000 of interest patronage, as certain Farm\nCredit associations paid a portion of the 2022 interest patronage (which relates to interest accrued during 2022 but is typically paid during the first half of 2023) early. In total,\n2022 interest patronage resulted in a 24.1% reduction (approximately 109 basis points) to the interest rates on such borrowings. In addition, during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, we recorded approximately $111,000 of interest patronage, as certain Farm Credit associations paid a portion of the 2023 interest patronage early. We are\nunable to estimate the remaining amount of interest patronage to be received, if any, related to interest accrued during 2023 on our Farm Credit Notes Payable.\nDebt Service – Aggregate Maturities\nScheduled principal payments of our aggregate notes and bonds payable as of December 31, 2023, for the succeeding years are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nPeriod Scheduled Principal Payments\nFor the fiscal years ending December 31: 2024 $ 40,656 (1)\n2025 39,020\n2026 18,175\n2027 51,389\n2028 77,808\nThereafter 349,791\n$ 576,839\n(1) Subsequent to December 31, 2023, we repaid $16.2 million of expiring bonds.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we repaid approximately $36.0 million of notes and bonds that were either maturing or scheduled for a price reset. On a weighted-\naverage basis, these borrowings bore interest at a stated rate of 3.73% and an effective interest rate (after interest patronage) of 3.56%.\nFair Value\nASC 820, “Fair Value Measurement (Subtopic 820)” (“ASC 820”), provides a definition of fair value that focuses on the exchange (exit) price of an asset or liability in the\nprincipal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes the use of market-based inputs to the valuation. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value\nmeasurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\n• Level 1 — inputs that are based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n• Level 2 — inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active or inactive markets or model-based valuation techniques, for which all significant\ninputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and\n• Level 3 — inputs are generally unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. These unobservable inputs are generally supported by little or no market\nactivity and are based upon management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value of our notes and bonds payable was approximately $529.4 million, as compared to an aggregate carrying value (excluding\nunamortized related debt issuance costs) of approximately $576.8 million. The fair value of our long-term notes and bonds payable is valued using Level 3 inputs under the\nhierarchy established by ASC\n82\nTable of Content\n820-10 and is determined by a discounted cash flow analysis, using discount rates based on management’s estimates of market interest rates on long-term debt with comparable\nterms. Further, due to the revolving nature and variable interest rates applicable to the MetLife Lines of Credit, their aggregate fair value as of December 31, 2023, is deemed to\napproximate their aggregate carrying value of $200,000.\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nIn order to hedge our exposure to variable interest rates, we have entered into various interest rate swap agreements in connection with certain of our mortgage financings. In\naccordance with these swap agreements, we will pay our counterparty a fixed interest rate on a quarterly basis and receive payments from our counterparty equal to the\nrespective stipulated floating rates. We have adopted the fair value measurement provision for these financial instruments, and the aggregate fair value of our interest rate swap\nagreements is recorded in Other assets, net or Other liabilities, net, as appropriate, on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, in the absence of observable\nmarket data, we will estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps using estimates of certain data points, including estimated remaining life, counterparty credit risk, current\nmarket yield, and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date. In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s fair value measurement\nguidance, we have made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net\nbasis by counterparty portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, our interest rate swaps were valued using Level 2 inputs.\nIn addition, we have designated our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss\non the derivative is initially recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassified into\ninterest expense in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects. During the next 12 months, we estimate that an additional $2.2 million will be reclassified as\na reduction to interest expense.\nWe had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in\nthousands):\nPeriod Number of Instruments Aggregate Notional Amount\nAs of December 31, 2023 4 $ 70,229\nAs of December 31, 2022 4 73,392\nThe following table presents the fair value of our interest rate swaps and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets aso f December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in\nthousands):\nDerivative Asset (Liability) Fair Value\nDerivative Type Balance Sheet Location December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nInterest rate swaps Other assets, net $ 7,366 $ 9,007\nTotal $ 7,366 $ 9,007\nThe following table presents the amount of income (loss) recognized in comprehensive income within our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nDerivative in cash flow hedging relationship:\nInterest rate swaps $ (1,641) $ 10,043 $ 464\nTotal $ (1,641) $ 10,043 $ 464\nCredit-risk-related Contingent Features\nWe have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if we default on any of our indebtedness, then we could also be declared in default\non our derivative obligations. As of December 31, 2023, we did not have any derivatives in a net liability position, nor have we posted any collateral related to these\nagreements.\nNOTE 5. MANDATORILY-REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK\nSeries A Term Preferred Stock\n83\nTable of Content\nIn August 2016, we completed a public offering of 6.375% Series A Cumulative Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series A Term Preferred Stock”), at a\npublic offering price of $25.00 per share. As a result of this offering (including the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments),\nwe issued a total of 1,150,000 shares of the Series A Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $28.8 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting\ndiscounts and offering expenses borne by us, of approximately $27.6 million.\nOn February 12, 2021, we redeemed all of our outstanding shares of Series A Term Preferred Stock at a cash redemption price of $25.00 per share plus all accrued and unpaid\ndividends up to, but excluding, the redemption date. In total, we paid approximately $28.8 million for the redemption of the Series A Term Preferred Stock using proceeds from\nthe offering of our Series D Term Preferred Stock (as defined below). Our Series A Term Preferred Stock was delisted from Nasdaq on the date we redeemed all outstanding\nshares. In connection with this early redemption, we wrote off approximately $127,000 of unamortized issuance costs related to the issuance of the Series A Term Preferred\nStock.\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock\nIn January 2021, we completed a public offering of 5.00% Series D Cumulative Term Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series D Term Preferred Stock”), at a\npublic offering price of $25.00 per share. As a result of this offering (including the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments),\nwe issued a total of 2,415,000 shares of the Series D Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million and net proceeds, after deducting underwriting\ndiscounts and offering expenses borne by us, of approximately $58.3 million. The Series D Term Preferred Stock is traded under the ticker symbol “LANDM” on Nasdaq.\nThe shares of the Series D Term Preferred Stock have a mandatory redemption date of January 31, 2026, and are not convertible into our common stock or any other securities.\nGenerally, we were not permitted to redeem shares of the Series D Term Preferred Stock prior to January 31, 2023, except in limited circumstances to preserve our qualification\nas a REIT. On or after January 31, 2023, we may redeem the shares at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to, but excluding,\nthe date of redemption.\nWe incurred approximately $2.1 million in total offering costs related to this issuance, which have been recorded net of the Series D Term Preferred Stock as presented on the\naccompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized over the mandatory redemption period as a component of interest expense on the accompanying\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The Series D Term Preferred Stock is recorded as a liability on our accompanying Consolidated Balance\nSheets in accordance with ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,” which states that mandatorily-redeemable financial instruments should be classified as liabilities.\nIn addition, the related dividend payments are treated similarly to interest expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of our Series D Term Preferred Stock was approximately $57.4 million, as compared to the carrying value (exclusive of unamortized\noffering costs) of approximately $60.4 million. The fair value of our Series D Term Preferred Stock uses Level 1 inputs under the hierarchy established by ASC 820-10 and is\ncalculated based on the closing per-share price on December 31, 2023, of $23.75.\nFor information on the dividends declared by our Board of Directors and paid by us on the Series D Term Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2023, see Note\n8, “Equity—Distributions.”\nNOTE 6. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nOur Adviser and Administrator\nWe are externally managed pursuant to contractual arrangements with our Adviser and our Administrator, which collectively employ all of our personnel and pay their salaries,\nbenefits, and general expenses directly. Both our Adviser and Administrator are affiliates of ours, as their parent company is owned and controlled by David Gladstone, our\nchairman, chief executive officer, and president. In addition, two of our executive officers, Mr. Gladstone and Terry Brubaker (our chief operating officer), serve as directors\nand executive officers of each of our Adviser and Administrator. Michael LiCalsi, our general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president, general\ncounsel, and secretary) is also executive vice president of administration of our Adviser.\nWe have entered into an investment advisory agreement with our Adviser and an administration agreement with our Administrator (the “Administration Agreement”). The\nadvisory agreement with our Advisor that was in effect through June 30, 2021 (the “Prior Advisory Agreement”), was amended and restated effective July 1, 2021 (as amended,\nthe “Current Advisory Agreement,” and together with the Prior Advisory Agreement, the “Advisory Agreements”). Each of the Advisory Agreements and the Administration\nAgreement were approved unanimously by our Board of Directors, including our independent directors.\n84\nTable of Content\nOur Board of Directors reviews and considers renewing the agreement with our Adviser each July. During its July 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors reviewed and renewed\neach of the Current Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement for an additional year, through August 31, 2024.\nA summary of the compensation terms for each of the Advisory Agreements and a summary of the Administration Agreement is below.\nAdvisory Agreements\nPursuant to each of the Prior Advisory Agreement (which was in effect from January 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021) and the Current Advisory Agreement (which has been in\neffect since July 1, 2021), our Adviser is compensated in the form of a base management fee and, each as applicable, an incentive fee, a capital gains fee, and a termination fee.\nOur Adviser does not charge acquisition or disposition fees when we acquire or dispose of properties, as is common in other externally-managed REITs. Each of the base\nmanagement, incentive, capital gains, and termination fees is described below.\nBase Management Fee\nPursuant to the Prior Advisory Agreement, a base management fee was paid quarterly and was calculated at an annual rate of0 .50% (0.125% per quarter) of the prior calendar\nquarter’s “Gross Tangible Real Estate,” defined as the gross cost of tangible real estate owned by us (including land and land improvements, permanent plantings, irrigation and\ndrainage systems, farm-related facilities, and other tangible site improvements), prior to any accumulated depreciation, and as shown on our balance sheet or the notes thereto\nfor the applicable quarter.\nPursuant to the Current Advisory Agreement, a base management fee is paid quarterly and is calculated at an annual rate of0 .60% (0.15% per quarter) of the prior calendar\nquarter’s Gross Tangible Real Estate.\nIncentive Fee\nPursuant to each of the Advisory Agreements, an incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears if the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO for a particular quarter exceeded a\nhurdle rate of 1.75% (7.0% annualized) of the prior calendar quarter’s Total Adjusted Common Equity.\nFor purposes of this calculation, Pre-Incentive Fee FFO is defined in each of the Advisory Agreements as FFO (also as defined in each of the Advisory Agreements) accrued by\nthe Company during the current calendar quarter (prior to any incentive fee calculation for the current calendar quarter), less any dividends declared on preferred stock securities\nthat were not treated as a liability for GAAP purposes. In addition, Total Adjusted Common Equity is defined as common stockholders’ equity plus non-controlling common\ninterests in the Operating Partnership, if any (each as reported on our balance sheet), adjusted to exclude unrealized gains and losses and certain other one-time events and non-\ncash items.\nOur Adviser receives: (i) no Incentive Fee in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO does not exceed the hurdle rate; (ii)1 00% of the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO\nwith respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but was less than 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized); and\n(iii) 20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee FFO, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% in any calendar quarter (8.75% annualized).\nCapital Gains Fee\nPursuant to each of the Advisory Agreements, a capital gains-based incentive fee is calculated and payable in arrears at the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the\nagreement with our Adviser). The capital gains fee shall equal: (i) 15% of the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains minus the cumulative aggregate realized capital\nlosses, minus (ii) any aggregate capital gains fees paid in prior periods. For purposes of this calculation, realized capital gains and losses will be calculated as (x) the sales price\nof the property, minus (y) any costs to sell the property and the then-current gross value of the property (which includes the property’s original acquisition price plus any\nsubsequent, non-reimbursed capital improvements). At the end of each fiscal year, if this figure is negative, no capital gains fee shall be paid.\nTermination Fee\nPursuant to each of the Advisory Agreements, in the event of our termination of the agreement with our Adviser for any reason (with1 20 days’ prior written notice and the vote\nof at least two-thirds of our independent directors), a termination fee would be payable to the Adviser equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee\nand incentive fee earned by the Adviser during the 24-month period prior to such termination.\nAdministration Agreement\nPursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay for our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses incurred while performing its obligations to us, including, but not\nlimited to, rent and the salaries and benefits expenses of our Administrator’s\n85\nTable of Content\nemployees, including our chief financial officer, treasurer, chief compliance officer, general counsel and secretary (who also serves as our Administrator’s president, general\ncounsel, and secretary), and their respective staffs.\nAs approved by our Board of Directors, our allocable portion of the Administrator’s expenses is generally derived by multiplying our Administrator’s total expenses by the\napproximate percentage of time the Administrator’s employees perform services for us in relation to their time spent performing services for all companies serviced by our\nAdministrator under similar contractual agreements.\nGladstone Securities\nWe have entered into an agreement with Gladstone Securities, LLC (“Gladstone Securities”), for it to act as our non-exclusive agent to assist us with arranging financing for our\nproperties (the “Financing Arrangement Agreement”). Gladstone Securities is a privately-held broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and\nthe Securities Investor Protection Corporation. Gladstone Securities is an affiliate of ours, as its parent company is owned and controlled by Mr. Gladstone, who also serves on\nthe board of managers of Gladstone Securities. In addition, Michael LiCalsi, our General Counsel and Secretary, serves in several capacities for Gladstone Securities, including\nas chief legal officer, secretary, a member of its board of managers, and a managing principal.\nFinancing Arrangement Agreement\nWe pay Gladstone Securities a financing fee in connection with the services it provides to us for securing financing on our properties. Depending on the size of the financing\nobtained, the maximum amount of the financing fee, which will be payable upon closing of the respective financing, will range from 0.5% to 1.0% of the amount of financing\nobtained. The amount of the financing fee may be reduced or eliminated as determined by us and Gladstone Securities after taking into consideration various factors, including,\nbut not limited to, the involvement of any unrelated third-party brokers and general market conditions.\nWe did not pay any financing fees to Gladstone Securities during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, we paid total\nfinancing fees to Gladstone Securities of approximately $154,000 and $166,000, respectively. Through December 31, 2023, the total amount of financing fees paid to Gladstone\nSecurities represented approximately 0.14% of the total financings secured since the Financing Arrangement Agreement has been in place.\nDealer-Manager Agreements\nWe have entered into dealer-manager agreements with Gladstone Securities (collectively, the “Dealer-Manager Agreements”), pursuant to which Gladstone Securities served or\nserves as our exclusive dealer-manager in connection with the offering of our Series C Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock (each as defined in Note 8, “Equity—Equity\nIssuances”).\nPursuant to the Dealer-Manager Agreements, Gladstone Securities provided or provides certain sales, promotional, and marketing services to us in connection with the offering\nof the Series C Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, and we generally paid or pay Gladstone Securities for the following:\n• With regard to the Series C Preferred Stock:\ni selling commissions of up to 6.0% of the gross proceeds from sales in the offering (the “Series C Selling Commissions”), and\nii a dealer-manager fee of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from sales in the offering (the “Series C Dealer-Manager Fee”).\n• With regard to the Series E Preferred Stock:\ni selling commissions of up to 7.0% of the gross proceeds from sales in the offering (the “Series E Selling Commissions,” and together with the Series C Selling\nCommissions, the “Selling Commissions”), and\nii a dealer-manager fee of 3.0% of the gross proceeds from sales in the offering (the “Series E Dealer-Manager Fee,” and together with the Series C Dealer-Manager\nFee, the “Dealer-Manager Fees”).\nNo Selling Commissions or Dealer-Manager Fees shall be paid with respect to shares of the Series C Preferred Stock sold pursuant to our dividend reinvestment plan (the\n“DRIP”) for the Series C Preferred Stock. Gladstone Securities may, in its sole discretion, remit all or a portion of the Selling Commissions and also reallow all or a portion of\nthe Dealer-Manager Fees to participating broker-dealers and wholesalers in support of the offerings. The terms of each of the Dealer-Manager Agreements were approved by\nour Board of Directors, including all of our independent directors.\nThe following tables summarizes the total Selling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees paid to Gladstone Securities during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021 (dollars in thousands):\n86\nTable of Content\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nSeries C Preferred Stock $ — $ 13,471 $ 4,961\nSeries E Preferred Stock 583 — —\nTotal Selling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees $ 583 $ 13,471 $ 4,961\nSelling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees paid to Gladstone Securities are netted against the gross proceeds received from sales of the respective securities and are\nincluded within Additional paid-in capital on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRelated Party Fees\nThe following table summarizes related-party fees paid or accrued for and reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements (dollars in thousands):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nBase management fee(1)(2) $ 8,603 $ 8,307 $ 6,329\nIncentive fee(1)(2) 1,771 3,225 3,901\nTotal fees to our Adviser $ 10,374 $ 11,532 $ 10,230\nAdministration fee(1)(2) $ 2,255 $ 2,005 $ 1,526\nSelling Commissions and Dealer-Manager Fees(1)(3) $ 583 $ 13,471 $ 4,961\nFinancing fees(1)(4) — 154 166\nTotal fees to Gladstone Securities $ 583 $ 13,625 $ 5,127\n(1) Pursuant to the agreements with the respective related-party entities, as discussed above.\n(2) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(3) Included within Additional paid-in capital on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(4) Included within Notes and bonds payable, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized into Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nRelated-Party Fees Due\nAmounts due to related parties on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nBase management fee $ 2,156 $ 2,141\nIncentive fee 982 1,589\nOther, net(1) 49 80\nTotal due to Adviser 3,187 3,810\nAdministration fee 546 536\nCumulative accrued but unpaid portions of prior Administration Fees(2) 141 —\nTotal due to Administrator 687 536\nTotal due to Gladstone Securities(3) — 24\nTotal due to related parties(4) $ 3,874 $ 4,370\n(1) Other amounts due to or from our Adviser primarily relate to miscellaneous general and administrative expenses either paid by our Adviser on our behalf or by us on our Adviser’s behalf.\n(2) Represents the cumulative accrued but unpaid portion of prior Administration fees that are scheduled to be paid during the three months ending September 30 of each year, which is the quarter following our\nAdministrator’s fiscal year end.\n(3) Represents certain costs related to sales of preferred stock paid by Gladstone Securities on our behalf.\n(4) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 7.

These operating ground\nleases have lease expiration dates ranging from February 2025 through December 2041, and none of these leases contain any extension, renewal, or termination options. At\nlease commencement, the net present value of the minimum lease payments was determined by discounting the respective future minimum lease payments using a discount rate\nequivalent to our fully-collateralized borrowing rate ranging from 4.22% to 8.72%.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded the following as a result of these operating ground leases (dollars in thousands, except for footnotes):\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nOperating lease right-of-use assets(1) $ 574 $ 623\nOperating lease liabilities(2) $ 568 $ 617\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 15.0 15.3\nWeighted-average incremental borrowing rate 8.12 % 7.93 %\n(1) Operating lease right-of-use assets are shown net of prepaid lease payments of approximately $6,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and are included within Other assets, net on\nthe accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2) Included within Other liabilities, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFuture minimum lease payments due under the remaining non-cancelable terms of these leases as of December 31, 2023, are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nPeriod Future Lease Payments(1)\nFor the fiscal years ending December 31:2024 $ 92\n2025 62\n2026 62\n2027 62\n2028 62\nThereafter 631\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 971\nLess: imputed interest (403)\nPresent value of lease payments $ 568\n(1) Certain annual lease payments are set at the beginning of each year to then-current market rates (as determined by the lessor).

We are\nnot currently subject to any known material litigation known or, to our knowledge, threatened litigation.\nNOTE 8. EQUITY\nAmendment to Articles of Incorporation and Operating Partnership Agreement\nOn January 13, 2021, we amended our articles of incorporation (i) setting forth the rights, preferences, and terms of the Series D Term Preferred Stock and (ii) reclassifying and\ndesignating 3,600,000 shares of our authorized and unissued shares of common stock as shares of Series D Term Preferred Stock. In connection with the authorization of the\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock, we amended our Operating Partnership agreement to provide for the establishment and issuance of an equal number of 5.00% Series D\nCumulative Term Preferred Units (the “Series D Term Preferred Units”) as are issued shares of the Series D Term Preferred Stock by the Company. Generally, the Series D\nTerm Preferred OP Units have preferences, distribution rights, and other provisions substantially equivalent to those of the Series D Term Preferred Stock.\nOn November 9, 2022, we further amended our articles of incorporation (i) reclassifying and designating1 5,551,347 authorized but unissued shares of our Series C Preferred\nStock and 1,185,000 authorized but unissued shares of our Series D Term Preferred Stock as shares of common stock, (ii) setting forth the rights, preferences, and terms of the\nSeries E Preferred Stock, and (iii) reclassifying and designating 16,000,000 shares of our authorized and unissued shares of common stock as shares of Series E Term Preferred\nStock. In connection with the authorization of the Series E Preferred Stock, we amended our Operating Partnership agreement to provide for the establishment and issuance of\nan equal number of 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (the “Series E Preferred OP Units”) as are issued shares of the Series E Preferred Stock by the\nCompany. Generally, the Series E Preferred OP Units have preferences, distribution rights, and other provisions substantially equivalent to those of the Series E Preferred Stock.\nRegistration Statement\nOn March 6, 2020, we filed a universal registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-236943) with the SEC (the “2020 Registration Statement”). The 2020 Registration\nStatement, which was declared effective by the SEC on April 1, 2020, permitted us to issue up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion in securities, consisting of common stock,\npreferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depository shares, subscription rights, and units, including through separate, concurrent offerings of two or more of such securities.\nUnder the 2020 Registration Statement, we issued a total of approximately 10,254,072 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $253.9 million,\n2,415,000 shares of Series D Term Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of approximately $60.4 million, 77,841 shares of Series E Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of\napproximately $1.9 million, and 14,367,524 shares of common stock (including common stock issued to redeem OP Units) for gross proceeds of approximately 2$80.9 million.\nOn March 28, 2023, we filed a universal registration statement on Form S-3, as amended (File No. 333-270901), with the SEC (the “2023 Registration Statement”) to replace\nthe 2020 Registration Statement. The 2023 Registration Statement, which was declared effective by the SEC on April 13, 2023, permits us to issue up to an aggregate of\n$1.5 billion in securities consisting of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, depository shares, subscription rights, and units, including through separate,\nconcurrent offerings of two or more securities. Through December 31, 2023, we have issued a total of 159,600 shares of Series E Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of\napproximately $4.0 million and 124,460 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $2.2 million under the 2023 Registration Statement. See Note 11,\n“Subsequent Events,” for equity issuances completed subsequent to December 31, 2023.\nEquity Issuances\nSeries C Preferred Stock\n89\nTable of Content\nOn April 3, 2020, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for a continuous public offering (the “Series C Offering”) of up to2 6,000,000 shares of our newly-designated\n6.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). The Series C Offering permitted us to sell up to\n20,000,000 shares (the “Primary Series C Offering”) of our Series C Preferred Stock on a “reasonable best efforts” basis through Gladstone Securities at an offering price of\n$25.00 per share and up to 6,000,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to the DRIP at a price of $22.75 per share. On August 24, 2022, we amended the Series C\nOffering, to (i) reduce the amount of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock offered through the Primary Series C Offering to 10,200,000, (ii) reduce the amount of shares of the\nSeries C Preferred Stock offered pursuant to the DRIP to 200,000, and (iii) reduce the duration of the period during which shares of the Series C Preferred Stock may be offered\nto the earlier of (a) December 31, 2022 (unless earlier terminated or extended by our Board of Directors) or (b) the date on which all 10,200,000 shares of the Series C Preferred\nStock offered in the Primary Series C Offering are sold. In conjunction with the amendment of the Series C Offering, we expensed approximately $798,000 of unamortized\ndeferred offering costs. These costs were recorded to Write-off of costs associated with the offering of Series C cumulative redeemable preferred stock on the accompanying\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Primary Series C Offering terminated on December 31, 2022, with substantially all of the allotted 10,200,000 shares being sold. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock\nDRIP was terminated effective March 22, 2023. Exclusive of redemptions, the Primary Series C Offering resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $252.6 million and\nnet proceeds, after deducting Series C Selling Commissions, Series C Dealer-Manager Fees, and offering expenses payable by us, of approximately $230.5 million. See Note 6,\n“Related-Party Transactions—Gladstone Securities—Dealer-Manager Agreements,” for a discussion of the commissions and fees paid to Gladstone Securities in connection\nwith the Series C Offering.\nThe following table provides information on sales of the Series C Preferred Stock that occurred during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 (dollars in thousands,\nexcept per-share amounts):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2022 2021\nNumber of shares sold(1) 6,701,987 2,407,027\nWeighted-average offering price per share $ 24.76 $ 24.81\nGross proceeds $ 165,941 $ 59,720\nNet proceeds(2) $ 152,470 $ 54,760\n(1) Excludes shares issued pursuant to the DRIP. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we issued approximately 14,069 shares, 34,628 shares, and 7,791 shares, respectively, of the\nSeries C Preferred Stock pursuant to the DRIP.\n(2) Net of Series C Selling Commissions, Series C Dealer-Manager Fees, and underwriting discounts.\nIn addition, during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,4 8,913 shares, 38,595 shares, and 9,920 shares, respectively, of Series C Preferred Stock were tendered\nfor optional redemption, which we satisfied with aggregate cash payments of approximately $1.2 million, $901,000, and $248,000, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we listed the Series C Preferred Stock on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “LANDP.” Trading of the Series C Preferred Stock on\nNasdaq commenced on June 8, 2023.\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn November 9, 2022, we filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC for a continuous public offering (the “Series E Offering”) of up to8 ,000,000 shares of our newly-\ndesignated 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Series E Preferred Stock”), on a “reasonable best efforts” basis through\nGladstone Securities at an offering price of $25.00 per share. See Note 6, “Related-Party Transactions—Gladstone Securities—Dealer-Manager Agreements,” for a discussion\nof the commissions and fees to be paid to Gladstone Securities in connection with the Series E Offering.\nNo shares of the Series E Preferred Stock had been sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. The following table provides information on sales of our Series E Preferred\nStock during the year ended December 31, 2023 (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nNumber of shares sold 237,441\nWeighted-average offering price per share $ 24.96\nGross proceeds $ 5,925\nNet proceeds(1) $ 5,342\n(1) Net of Selling Commissions, Dealer-Manager Fees, and underwriting discounts.\n90\nTable of Content\nRefer to Note 11, “Subsequent Events—Equity Activity—Series E Preferred Stock,” for sales of the Series E Preferred Stock completed subsequent to December 31, 2023.\nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, 1,600 shares of Series E Preferred Stock were tendered for optional redemption, which we satisfied with an aggregate\ncash payment of approximately $36,000.\nThe Series E Offering will terminate on the date (the “Series E Termination Date”) that is the earlier of (i) December 31, 2025 (unless terminated or extended by its Board of\nDirectors) and (ii) the date on which all 8,000,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock offering in the Series E Offering are sold. There is currently no public market for shares of\nSeries E Preferred Stock. The Company intends to apply to list the Series E Preferred Stock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one 12 months after the\nSeries E Termination Date; however, there can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such timeframe, or at all.\nCommon Stock\nAt-the-Market Program\nOn May 12, 2020, we entered into equity distribution agreements (commonly referred to as “at-the-market agreements”) with Virtu Americas LLC and Ladenburg Thalmann &\nCo. Inc. (each a “Sales Agent”), that as subsequently amended, permitted us to issue and sell, from time to time and through the Sales Agents, shares of our common stock\nhaving an aggregate offering price up to $260.0 million (the “Prior ATM Program). On April 13, 2023, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution\nagreements with the Sales Agents to allow us to sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500.0 million (the “New ATM Program,” and\ncollectively with the Prior ATM Program, the “ATM Program”). The following table provides information on shares of common stock sold by the Sales Agents under the ATM\nProgram during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except per-share amounts):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nNumber of shares sold 788,045 840,384 7,990,994\nWeighted-average offering price per share $ 19.34 $ 26.47 $ 21.70\nGross proceeds $ 15,240 $ 22,242 $ 173,428\nNet proceeds(1) $ 15,087 $ 21,993 $ 171,693\n(1) Net of underwriting commissions.\nNon-Controlling Interests in Operating Partnership\nWe consolidate our Operating Partnership, which is a majority-owned partnership. As of December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we owned approximately 100.0%, 100.0%, and\n99.4%, respectively, of the outstanding OP Units. As of each of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, there were 204,778 OP Units held by non-controlling OP Unitholders.\nOn or after 12 months after becoming a holder of OP Units, each non-controlling OP Unitholder has the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the partnership\nagreement of the Operating Partnership, to require the Operating Partnership to redeem all or a portion of such units in exchange for cash or, at the Company’s option, shares of\nour common stock on a one-for-one basis. The cash redemption per OP Unit would be based on the market price of our common stock at the time of redemption. A limited\npartner will not be entitled to exercise redemption rights if the delivery of common stock to the redeeming limited partner would breach restrictions on the ownership of\ncommon stock imposed under our charter and other limitations thereof.\nRegardless of the rights described above, the Operating Partnership will not have an obligation to issue cash to a unitholder upon a redemption request if the Company elects to\nredeem the OP Units for shares of its common stock. When a non-controlling unitholder redeems OP Units and the Company elects to satisfy that redemption through the\nissuance of common stock, non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership is reduced and stockholders’ equity is increased.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we issued 204,778 OP Units to noncontrolling OP Unitholders representing an aggregate value of approximately $4.0 million, or\n$19.42 per OP Unit. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we redeemed those 204,778 OP Units with a cash payment of approximately $7.7 million or $37.45 per OP\nUnit.\nThe Operating Partnership is required to make distributions on each OP Unit in the same amount as those paid on each share of the Company’s common stock, with the\ndistributions on the OP Units held by the Company being utilized to make distributions to the Company’s common stockholders.\n91\nTable of Content\nDistributions\nThe per-share distributions to preferred and common stockholders declared by our Board of Directors during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 are reflected\nin the table below.\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\nIssuance 2023 2022 2021\nSeries A Term Preferred Stock(1)(2) $ — $ — $ 0.181510\nSeries B Preferred Stock 1.500000 1.500000 1.500000\nSeries C Preferred Stock 1.500000 1.500000 1.500000\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock(1)(3) 1.250004 1.250004 1.184031\nSeries E Preferred Stock 1.250004 — —\nCommon Stock(4) 0.553500 0.546300 0.540750\n(1) Dividends are treated similar to interest expense on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(2) The Series A Term Preferred Stock was redeemed in full on February 12, 2021.\n(3) The Series D Term Preferred Stock was issued on January 19, 2021.\n(4) The same amounts were paid as distributions on each OP Unit held by non-controlling OP Unitholders.\nFor federal income tax characterization purposes, distributions paid to stockholders may be characterized as ordinary income, capital gains, return of capital, or a combination\nthereof. The characterization of distributions on our preferred and common stock during each of the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 is reflected in the\nfollowing table:\nOrdinary Long-term Return of\nIncome Capital Gain Capital\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nSeries B Preferred Stock 30.782342 % 22.611772 % 46.605886 %\nSeries C Preferred Stock 30.782342 % 22.611772 % 46.605886 %\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock 30.782342 % 22.611772 % 46.605886 %\nSeries E Preferred Stock 30.782342 % 22.611772 % 46.605886 %\nCommon Stock — % — % 100.000000 %\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nSeries B Preferred Stock 34.205000 % — % 65.795000 %\nSeries C Preferred Stock 34.205000 % — % 65.795000 %\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock 34.205000 % — % 65.795000 %\nCommon Stock — % — % 100.000000 %\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2021\nSeries A Term Preferred Stock 54.534493 % — % 45.465507 %\nSeries B Preferred Stock 54.534493 % — % 45.465507 %\nSeries C Preferred Stock 54.534493 % — % 45.465507 %\nSeries D Term Preferred Stock 54.534493 % — % 45.465507 %\nCommon Stock — % — % 100.000000 %\nNOTE 9. LEASE REVENUES\nThe following table sets forth the components of our lease revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (dollars in thousands, except for footnotes):\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nFixed lease payments(1) $ 83,695 $ 81,423 $ 69,998\nVariable lease payments(2) 6,624 7,813 5,320\nLease revenue, net(3) $ 90,319 $ 89,236 $ 75,318\n92\nTable of Content\n(1) Fixed lease payments include contractual rents under lease agreements with tenants recognized on a straight-line basis over the respective lease terms and includes the amortization of above-market lease\nvalues and lease incentives and the accretion of below-market lease values and other deferred revenue.\n(2) Variable lease payments include participation rents, which are generally based on a percentage of the gross crop revenues earned on the farm, and reimbursements of certain property operating expenses by\ntenants. Participation rents are generally recognized when all contingencies have been resolved and when actual results become known or estimable, enabling us to estimate and/or measure our share of\nsuch gross revenues. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we recorded participation rents of approximately $5.9 million, $7.7 million, and $5.2 million, respectively, and\nreimbursements of certain property operating expenses by tenants of approximately $688,000, $110,000, and $101,000, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded\nlate fees of approximately $46,000.\n(3) Reflected as a line item on our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\nNOTE 10. EARNINGS PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, computed using the\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the respective periods.

However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and\nprocedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of necessarily\nachieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nRefer to “Report of Management on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting,” located in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n(c) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nRefer to the “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” located in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter or year ended December 31, 2023, that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.

Our 5.00% Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock,\npar value $0.001 per share (the “Series E Preferred Stock”) is not registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.\nWe collectively refer to our Series B Preferred Stock, our Series C Preferred Stock, our Series D Preferred Stock and our Series E Preferred\nStock as our “Preferred Stock,” where appropriate. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of Securities is an exhibit.\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK\nGeneral\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of capital stock, $0.001 par value per share, 64,728,935 of which are classified as\ncommon stock, 6,456,065 of which are classified as Series B Preferred Stock, 10,400,000 of which are classified as Series C Preferred Stock,\n2,415,000 of which are classified as Series D Preferred Stock and 16,000,000 of which are classified as Series E Preferred Stock. Under our\ncharter, our board of directors is authorized to classify and reclassify any unissued shares of capital stock into other classes or series of stock by\nsetting or changing in any one or more respects, from time to time before issuance of such stock, the preferences, conversion or other rights,\nvoting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of such\nstock. In addition, our board of directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire board and without any action by our stockholders, may\namend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any\nclass or series that we have authority to issue.\nThe following summary description of our capital stock is not necessarily complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our charter\nand bylaws, as amended, each of which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as applicable provisions of the\nGeneral Corporation Law of the State of Maryland (the “MGCL”).\nMeetings and Special Voting Requirements\nAn annual meeting of the stockholders is held each year for the purpose of electing the class of directors whose term is up for election and to\nconduct other business that may be brought before the stockholders. Special meetings of stockholders may be called upon the request of our\nchairman, our chief executive officer, our president, a majority of our directors or a majority of our independent directors or by the written\nrequest of stockholders of record as of the request date entitled to cast not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast at such meeting,\nprovided that the request is in the form and manner specified in our Bylaws. In general, the presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the\noutstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting constitutes a quorum. Generally, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at a\nmeeting at which a quorum is present is necessary to take stockholder action, except that a plurality of all votes cast at such a meeting is\nsufficient to elect any director.\nUnder the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge, convert or consolidate with another entity, sell\nall or substantially all of its assets or engage in a statutory share exchange unless the action is declared advisable by its board of directors and\napproved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, unless a lesser\npercentage (but not less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is specified in the corporation’s charter. Our charter\nprovides that these actions (other than certain amendments to the provisions of our charter related to the removal of directors and the\nrestrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock, and the vote required to amend such provisions, which must be approved by the affirmative\nvote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the amendment) may be approved by a majority of all\nof the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nCommon Stock\nVoting Rights\nSubject to the provisions of our charter regarding restrictions on the transfer and ownership of our capital stock and except as may otherwise be\nspecified in the terms of any class or series of common stock, each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all\nmatters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and, except as provided with respect to any other class or series\nof capital stock, including our Preferred Stock, the holders of the common stock possess the exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative\nvoting in the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock, voting as a single class, can\nelect all of the directors then standing for election and the holders of the remaining shares are not able to elect any directors.\nDividends, Liquidations and Other Rights\nAll shares of common stock offered and sold will be duly authorized, fully paid and nonassessable. Holders of our common stock are entitled\nto receive dividends when authorized by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends.\nThey also are entitled to share ratably in our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of our liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up, after payment of or adequate provision for all of our known debts and liabilities. These rights are subject to the\npreferential rights of any other class or series of our shares, including our Preferred Stock, and to the provisions of our charter regarding\nrestrictions on transfer of our shares.\nHolders of our common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund, redemption or appraisal rights and have no preemptive\nrights to subscribe for any of our securities. Subject to the restrictions on transfer of shares contained in our charter, all shares of common stock\nhave equal dividend, liquidation and other rights.\nCertificates\nGenerally, we will not issue stock certificates. Shares of common stock will be held in “uncertificated” form, which will eliminate the physical\nhandling and safekeeping responsibilities inherent in owning transferable stock certificates and eliminate the need to return a duly executed\nstock certificate to the transfer agent to effect a transfer. Transfers can be effected simply by mailing to us a duly executed transfer form. Upon\nthe issuance of shares of common stock, we will send on request to each stockholder a written statement which will\ninclude all information that is required to be written upon stock certificates pursuant to the MGCL.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer and distribution paying agent and registrar for our common stock is Computershare, Inc.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\nDividends\nHolders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our Board of Directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the board) and declared by us, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, preferential cumulative\ncash dividends at the rate of 6.00% per annum of the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.50\nper share). Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are not eligible to participate in the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan. Dividends on\nshares of the Series B Preferred Stock will accrue and be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. Dividends on\noutstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will accrue and be cumulative from the end of the most recent dividend period for which\ndividends have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid, from the date of issuance. Dividends are payable monthly in arrears on such date\nas our Board of Directors may designate to holders of record as they appear in our stock records at the close of business on the applicable\nrecord date. The record date for each dividend will be designated by our Board of Directors and will be a date that is prior to the dividend\npayment date.\nOur Board of Directors will not authorize, and we will not declare, pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of Series B Preferred\nStock at any time that the terms and provisions of any of our agreements, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness, prohibits that\naction or provides that the authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment of those dividends would constitute a breach of or a\ndefault under any such agreement, or if such action is restricted or prohibited by law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not (1) restrictions exist in respect\nthereof, (2) we have earnings, (3) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, or (4) our Board of Directors authorizes\nor we declare such dividends. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will not bear interest, and holders of the\nSeries B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any distributions in excess of full cumulative dividends described above.\nIf we do not declare and either pay or set apart for payment the full cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock and all shares of\ncapital stock that are equal in rank with Series B Preferred Stock (including shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock\nand Series E Preferred Stock), the amount which we have declared will be allocated ratably to the Series B Preferred Stock and to each series of\nshares of capital stock equal in rank so that the amount declared for each share of Series B Preferred Stock and for each share of each series of\ncapital stock equal in rank is proportionate to the accrued and unpaid dividends on those shares.\nExcept as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been or\ncontemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment is set apart for payment) for all past dividend\nperiods, no dividends (other than in shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to\ndividends and upon liquidation) will be declared and paid or\ndeclared and set apart for payment nor will any other distribution be declared and made upon our common stock, or any of our other capital\nstock ranking junior to or equal with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, nor will we redeem, purchase, or\notherwise acquire for any consideration (or pay or make any monies available for a sinking fund for the redemption of any such shares) any\nshares of our common stock, or any other shares of our capital stock ranking junior to or equal with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends\nor upon liquidation (except by conversion into or exchange for any of our capital stock ranking junior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to\ndividends and upon liquidation or redemption for the purpose of preserving our qualification as a REIT).\nRanking\nThe Series B Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:\n• senior to all classes or series of our common stock and any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking\njunior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• on parity with our Series C Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock and any future class or series of our\ncapital stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• junior to any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect\nto dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, none of which exists on the date hereof; and\n• junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness.\nRedemption by Stockholders\nOptional Redemption Following Death of a Holder\nSubject to the restrictions described under “-Stockholder Redemption Option,” and the terms and procedures described below under “-\nRedemption Procedures,” commencing on the date of original issuance and terminating upon the listing of the Series B Preferred Stock on\nNasdaq or another national securities exchange, shares of Series B Preferred Stock held by a natural person upon his or her death will be\nredeemed at the written request of the holder’s estate for a cash payment of $25.00 per share of Series B Preferred Stock on the Death\nRedemption Date, which is the tenth calendar day following delivery of such holder’s estate’s request to redeem shares of the Series B\nPreferred Stock, or if such tenth calendar day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day.\nStockholder Redemption Option\nSubject to the restrictions described herein, and the terms and procedures described below under “-Redemption Procedures,” commencing on\nthe date of original issuance (or, if after the date of original issuance our Board of Directors suspends the redemption program of the holders of\nthe Series B Preferred Stock, on the date our Board of Directors reinstates such program) and terminating on the earlier to occur of (1) the date\nupon which our Board of Directors, by resolution, suspends or terminates the redemption program, and (2) the date on which shares of the\nSeries B Preferred Stock are listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock may, at their\noption, require us to redeem any or all of their\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock for a cash payment of $22.50 per share of Series B Preferred Stock on the Stockholder Redemption Date,\nwhich is the tenth calendar day following delivery of such holder’s request to redeem shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, or if such tenth\ncalendar day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day. The maximum dollar amount that we will make available each\ncalendar year to redeem shares of Series B Preferred Stock will not be subject to an annual limit; provided, that our obligation to redeem shares\nof Series B Preferred Stock is limited to the extent that our Board of Directors determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that we do not\nhave sufficient funds available to fund any such redemption or we are restricted by applicable law from making such redemption; and is also\nlimited to the extent our Board of Directors suspends or terminates the optional redemption right at any time or for any reason, including after\ndelivery of a Stockholder Redemption Notice but prior to the corresponding Stockholder Redemption Date.\nRedemption Procedures\nTo require us to redeem shares of Series B Preferred Stock, a holder or estate of a holder, as applicable, must deliver a notice of redemption, by\novernight delivery or by first class mail, postage prepaid to us at our principal executive offices. Each such notice must be an original, notarized\ncopy and must state: (1) the name and address of the stockholder whose shares of Series B Preferred Stock are requested to be redeemed, (2)\nthe number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock requested to be redeemed, (3) the name of the broker dealer who holds the shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock requested to be redeemed, the stockholder’s account number with such broker dealer and such broker dealer’s participant\nnumber for DTC and (4) in the case of a notice to redeem upon the death of a holder, a certified copy of the death certificate (and such other\nevidence that is satisfactory to us in our sole discretion) for the natural person who previously held the shares to be redeemed.\nIf, as a result of the limitations described under “-Stockholder Redemption Option,” the optional redemption right has not been suspended or\nterminated but fewer than all shares for which a notice of redemption was delivered to us are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be\nredeemed will be pro rata based on the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock for which each holder timely submitted a notice of\nredemption. If a Stockholder Redemption Date is also a Death Redemption Date, the limitations described under “-Stockholder Redemption\nOption” shall first be applied to any redemption requested upon the death of the holder and then to shares to be redeemed pursuant to the\nStockholder Redemption Option.\nUpon any redemption of shares of Series B Preferred Stock, the holder thereof will also be entitled to receive a sum equal to all accumulated\nand unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the applicable Stockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date (unless such\nStockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date falls after a dividend record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend\npayment date, in which case each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock on such dividend record date will be entitled to the dividend\npayable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date, notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such\ndividend payment date, and each holder of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are redeemed on such Stockholder Redemption Date or\nDeath Redemption Date will be entitled to the dividends, if any, occurring after the end of the dividend period to which such dividend payment\ndate relates up to, but excluding, the Stockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date, as the case may be). Upon the redemption of\nany shares of Series B Preferred Stock, such shares of Series B Preferred Stock will cease to be outstanding, dividends with respect to such\nshares of Series B Preferred Stock will cease to accumulate and all rights whatsoever with respect to such shares (except the right to receive the\nper share cash payment for the redeeming shares) will terminate.\nWe may suspend or terminate the redemption program at any time in our sole discretion.\nOptional Redemption by the Company\nWe may, at our sole option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ written notice, redeem shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, in\nwhole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accumulated\nand unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without interest. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock to\nbe redeemed must then surrender such Series B Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice. Upon surrender of the Series B Preferred\nStock, the holders will be entitled to the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock has been given and\nif we have deposited the funds necessary for such redemption with the paying agent for the benefit of the holders of any of the shares of Series\nB Preferred Stock to be redeemed, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock, those shares of Series B Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will\nterminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding Series B Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the\nSeries B Preferred Stock to be redeemed will be selected (1) pro rata, (2) by lot or (3) by any other fair and equitable method that our Board of\nDirectors may choose.\nUnless full cumulative dividends for all applicable past dividend periods on all shares of Series B Preferred Stock and any shares of stock that\nrank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum\nsufficient for payment set apart for payment), no shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be redeemed. In such event, we also will not purchase\nor otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series B Preferred Stock (except by exchange for our capital stock ranking junior to the\nSeries B Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation). However, the foregoing will not prevent us from purchasing shares pursuant to\nour charter, in order to ensure that we continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or from acquiring shares of Series B\nPreferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred\nStock and any shares of stock that rank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation. So long as no dividends are in arrears, we will\nbe entitled at any time and from time to time to repurchase shares of Series B Preferred Stock in open-market transactions duly authorized by\nthe Board of Directors and effected in compliance with applicable laws.\nWe will deliver a notice of redemption, by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically to holders thereof, or request\nour agent, on behalf of us, to promptly do so by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically. The notice will be\nprovided not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such notice. Each such notice will state: (1) the date\nfor redemption; (2) the number of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (3) the CUSIP number for the Series B Preferred Stock; (4) the\napplicable redemption price on a per share basis; (5) if applicable, the place or places where the certificate(s) for such shares are to be\nsurrendered for payment of the price for redemption; (6) that dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to\naccumulate from and after such date of redemption; and (7) the applicable provisions of our charter under which such redemption is made. If\nfewer than all shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice delivered to such holder will also specify the number of Series B\nPreferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder or the method of determining such number. We may provide in any such notice that such\nredemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent and that we will not be required to effect such redemption unless each such condition\nhas been satisfied at the time or times and in the manner specified in such notice. No defect in the notice or delivery thereof will affect the\nvalidity of redemption proceedings, except as required by applicable law.\nIf a redemption date falls after a record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend payment date, each holder of Series B Preferred\nStock at the close of business on that record date will be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend\npayment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before the dividend payment date, and the redemption price received by the\nholder on the redemption date will be $25.00 per share.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be\nentitled to be paid, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an\namount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date of payment, but without interest, before any\ndistribution of assets is made to holders of our common stock or any other class or series of our capital stock that ranks junior to the Series B\nPreferred Stock as to liquidation rights. If our assets legally available for distribution to stockholders are insufficient to pay in full the\nliquidation preference on the Series B Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference on any shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the\nSeries B Preferred Stock, all assets distributed to the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock equal in\nrank with the Series B Preferred Stock will be distributed ratably so that the amount of assets distributed per share of Series B Preferred Stock\nand such other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series B Preferred Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that\nthe liquidation preference per share on the Series B Preferred Stock and on such other series of preferred stock bear to each other. Written\nnotice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the\namounts distributable in such circumstances will be payable, will be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than\n60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series B Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such\nholders as the same appear on the stock transfer records of the Company. After payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference, plus\nany accumulated and unpaid dividends to which they are entitled, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of\nour remaining assets. If we convert into or consolidate or merge with or into any other corporation, trust or entity, effect a statutory share\nexchange or sell, lease, transfer or convey all or substantially all of our property or business, we will not be deemed to have liquidated,\ndissolved or wound up.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of the Series B Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights, except as described below.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears for 18 or more consecutive months, then the holders of those\nshares together with the holders of all other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series B Preferred Stock upon which like voting\nrights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote separately as a class for the election of a total of two additional directors\non our Board of Directors.\nThe election of these directors will take place at a special meeting called upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the\noutstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock or holders of record of at least 20% of any class or series of preferred stock equal in rank with\nthe Series B Preferred Stock which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (unless such request is received less than 90 days\nbefore the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each\nsubsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated from past dividend periods and the then current dividend period have been paid (or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for payment set apart). A quorum for any such meeting will exist if at least a majority of the total outstanding\nshares of\nSeries B Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series B Preferred Stock entitled to like voting rights\nare represented in person or by proxy at that meeting. The directors elected as described above will be elected upon the affirmative vote of a\nplurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and preferred stock equal in rank with the Series B Preferred\nStock, voting separately as a single class, present and voting in person or by proxy at a duly called and held meeting at which a quorum is\npresent. If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series B Preferred Stock have been\npaid in full or declared or set apart for payment in full the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will be divested of the right to elect directors\nand, if all dividend arrearages have been paid in full or declared and set apart for payment in full on all series of preferred stock entitled to like\nvoting rights, the term of office of each director so elected will terminate. Any director so elected may be removed at any time with or without\ncause by, and may not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Series B\nPreferred Stock having the voting rights described above, voting separately as a single class with all classes or series of preferred stock entitled\nto like voting rights. So long as a dividend arrearage continues, any vacancy in the office of a director elected as described above may be filled\nby written consent of the director elected as described above who remains in office, or if none remains in office, by a vote of the holders of\nrecord of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above, voting separately as a single\nclass with all classes or series of preferred stock entitled to like voting rights, by majority vote. These directors will each be entitled to one vote\nper director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at\nleast two-thirds of the shares of the Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a\nmeeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our charter, including the articles supplementary designating the\nSeries B Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference,\nprivilege or voting power of the Series B Preferred Stock. However, with respect to the occurrence of any event listed above, so long as the\nSeries B Preferred Stock remains outstanding (or shares issued by a surviving entity in substitution for the Series B Preferred Stock) with its\nterms materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such an event, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence\nof any such event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of the\nSeries B Preferred Stock. In addition (i) any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) any increase in the\nnumber of authorized shares of preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any other class or series of preferred stock or (iii) any increase in\nthe number of authorized shares of such class or series, in each case ranking equal with or junior to the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to\npayment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will not be deemed to materially and adversely\naffect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be\nrequired is effected, all outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and\nsufficient funds have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for the Series B Preferred Stock is Computershare, Inc.\nSeries C Preferred Stock\nDividends\nHolders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our Board of Directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the board) and declared by us, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, preferential cumulative\ncash dividends at the rate of 6.00% per annum of the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.50\nper share). Generally, holders of the Series C Preferred Stock are not eligible to participate in the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan,\nexcept that each registered holder of at least one full share of Series C Preferred Stock will be automatically enrolled in our Series C Preferred\nStock dividend reinvestment plan unless the stockholder opts out of the dividend reinvestment plan.\nDividends on shares of the Series C Preferred Stock will accrue and be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.\nDividends on outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock will accrue and be cumulative from the end of the most recent dividend period\nfor which dividends have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid, from the date of issuance. Dividends will be payable monthly in arrears,\non or about the fifth day of each month for dividends accrued the previous month or such other date as our Board of Directors may designate,\nto holders of record as they appear in our stock records at the close of business on the applicable record date. The record date for each dividend\nwill be designated by our Board of Directors and will be a date that is prior to the dividend payment date.\nOur Board of Directors will not authorize, and we will not declare, pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of Series C Preferred\nStock at any time that the terms and provisions of any of our agreements, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness, prohibits that\naction or provides that the authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment of those dividends would constitute a breach of or a\ndefault under any such agreement, or if such action is restricted or prohibited by law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not (1) restrictions exist in respect\nthereof, (2) we have earnings, (3) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, or (4) our Board of Directors authorizes\nor we declare such dividends. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock will not bear interest, and holders of the\nSeries C Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any distributions in excess of full cumulative dividends described above.\nIf we do not declare and either pay or set apart for payment the full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock and all shares of\ncapital stock that are equal in rank with Series C Preferred Stock (including shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock\nand Series E Preferred Stock), the amount which we have declared will be allocated ratably to the Series C Preferred Stock and to each series of\nshares of capital stock equal in rank so that the amount declared for each share of Series C Preferred Stock and for each share of each series of\ncapital stock equal in rank is proportionate to the accrued and unpaid dividends on those shares.\nExcept as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock have been or\ncontemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment is set apart for payment) for all past dividend\nperiods, no dividends (other than in shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to\ndividends and upon liquidation) will be declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment nor will any other distribution be declared and\nmade upon our common stock, or any of our other capital stock ranking junior to or equal with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or\nupon liquidation, nor will we redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire for any consideration (or pay or make any monies available for a sinking\nfund for the redemption of any such shares) any shares of our common stock, or any other shares of our\ncapital stock ranking junior to or equal with the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation (except by conversion into or\nexchange for any of our capital stock ranking junior to the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation or redemption for the\npurpose of preserving our qualification as a REIT).\nRanking\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:\n• senior to all classes or series of our common stock and any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking\njunior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• on parity with our Series B Preferred Stock, Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock and any future class or series of our\ncapital stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• junior to any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect\nto dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, none of which exists on the date hereof;

The maximum dollar amount\nthat we will make available each calendar year to redeem shares of Series C Preferred Stock will not\nbe subject to an annual limit; provided, that our obligation to redeem shares of Series C Preferred Stock is limited to the extent that our Board\nof Directors determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that we do not have sufficient funds available to fund any such redemption or we are\nrestricted by applicable law from making such redemption; and is also limited to the extent our Board of Directors suspends or terminates the\noptional redemption right at any time or for any reason, including after delivery of a Stockholder Redemption Notice but prior to the\ncorresponding Stockholder Redemption Date.\nRedemption Procedures\nTo require us to redeem shares of Series C Preferred Stock, a holder or estate of a holder, as applicable, must deliver a notice of redemption, by\novernight delivery or by first class mail, postage prepaid to us at our principal executive offices. Each such notice must be an original, notarized\ncopy and must state: (1) the name and address of the stockholder whose shares of Series C Preferred Stock are requested to be redeemed, (2)\nthe number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock requested to be redeemed, (3) the name of the broker dealer who holds the shares of Series C\nPreferred Stock requested to be redeemed, the stockholder’s account number with such broker dealer and such broker dealer’s participant\nnumber for DTC and (4) in the case of a notice to redeem upon the death of a holder, a certified copy of the death certificate (and such other\nevidence that is satisfactory to us in our sole discretion) for the natural person who previously held the shares to be redeemed.\nIf, as a result of the limitations described under “-Stockholder Redemption Option,” the optional redemption right has not been suspended or\nterminated but fewer than all shares for which a notice of redemption was delivered to us are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be\nredeemed will be pro rata based on the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock for which each holder timely submitted a notice of\nredemption. If a Stockholder Redemption Date is also a Death Redemption Date, the limitations described under “-Stockholder Redemption\nOption” shall first be applied to any redemption requested upon the death of the holder and then to shares to be redeemed pursuant to the\nStockholder Redemption Option.\nUpon any redemption of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the holder thereof will also be entitled to receive a sum equal to all accumulated\nand unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the applicable Stockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date (unless such\nStockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date falls after a dividend record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend\npayment date, in which case each holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock on such dividend record date will be entitled to the dividend\npayable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date, notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such\ndividend payment date, and each holder of shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are redeemed on such Stockholder Redemption Date or\nDeath Redemption Date will be entitled to the dividends, if any, occurring after the end of the dividend period to which such dividend payment\ndate relates up to, but excluding, the Stockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date, as the case may be).

Holders of\nSeries C Preferred Stock to be redeemed must then surrender such Series C Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice. Upon\nsurrender of the Series C Preferred Stock, the holders will be entitled to the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series C\nPreferred Stock has been given and if we have deposited the funds necessary for such redemption with the paying agent for the benefit of the\nholders of any of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to\naccumulate on those shares of Series C Preferred Stock, those shares of Series C Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all\nrights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding Series C\nPreferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed will be selected (1) pro rata, (2) by lot or (3) by any other fair\nand equitable method that our Board of Directors may choose.\nUnless full cumulative dividends for all applicable past dividend periods on all shares of Series C Preferred Stock and any shares of stock that\nrank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum\nsufficient for payment set apart for payment), no shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be redeemed. In such event, we also will not purchase\nor otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series C Preferred Stock (except by exchange for our capital stock ranking junior to the\nSeries C Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation). However, the foregoing will not prevent us from purchasing shares pursuant to\nour charter, in order to ensure that we continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or from acquiring shares of Series C\nPreferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred\nStock and any shares of stock that rank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation. Upon listing, if any, of the Series C Preferred\nStock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, so long as no dividends are in arrears, we will be entitled at any time and from time to\ntime to repurchase shares of Series C Preferred Stock in open-market transactions duly authorized by the Board of Directors and effected in\ncompliance with applicable laws.\nWe will deliver a notice of redemption, by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically to holders thereof, or request\nour agent, on behalf of us, to promptly do so by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically. The notice will be\nprovided not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such notice. Each such notice will state: (1) the date\nfor redemption; (2) the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (3) the CUSIP number for the Series C Preferred Stock;\n(4) the applicable redemption price on a per share basis; (5) if applicable, the place or places where the certificate(s) for such shares are to be\nsurrendered for payment of the price for redemption; (6) that dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to\naccumulate from and after such date of redemption; and (7) the applicable provisions of our charter under which such redemption is made. If\nfewer than all shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice delivered to such holder will also specify the number of Series C\nPreferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder or the method of determining such number. We may provide in any such notice that such\nredemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent and that we will not be required to effect such redemption unless each such condition\nhas been satisfied at the\ntime or times and in the manner specified in such notice. No defect in the notice or delivery thereof will affect the validity of redemption\nproceedings, except as required by applicable law.\nIf a redemption date falls after a record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend payment date, each holder of Series C Preferred\nStock at the close of business on that record date will be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend\npayment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before the dividend payment date, each holder of shares Series C Preferred Stock\nthat are redeemed on such redemption date will be entitled to the dividends, if any, accruing after the end of the dividend period for which such\ndividend payment date relates up to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be\nentitled to be paid, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an\namount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date of payment, but without interest, before any\ndistribution of assets is made to holders of our common stock or any other class or series of our capital stock that ranks junior to the Series C\nPreferred Stock as to liquidation rights. If our assets legally available for distribution to stockholders are insufficient to pay in full the\nliquidation preference on the Series C Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference on any shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the\nSeries C Preferred Stock, all assets distributed to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock equal in\nrank with the Series C Preferred Stock will be distributed ratably so that the amount of assets distributed per share of Series C Preferred Stock\nand such other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series C Preferred Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that\nthe liquidation preference per share on the Series C Preferred Stock and on such other series of preferred stock bear to each other. Written\nnotice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the\namounts distributable in such circumstances will be payable, will be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than\n60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series C Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such\nholders as the same appear on the stock transfer records of the Company. After payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference, plus\nany accumulated and unpaid dividends to which they are entitled, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of\nour remaining assets. If we convert into or consolidate or merge with or into any other corporation, trust or entity, effect a statutory share\nexchange or sell, lease, transfer or convey all or substantially all of our property or business, we will not be deemed to have liquidated,\ndissolved or wound up.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of the Series C Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as described below.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are in arrears for 18 or more consecutive months, then the holders of those\nshares together with the holders of all other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series C Preferred Stock upon which like voting\nrights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote separately as a class for the election of a total of two additional directors\non our Board of Directors.\nThe election of these directors will take place at a special meeting called upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the\noutstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock or holders of record of at least 20% of any class or series of preferred stock equal in rank with\nthe\nSeries C Preferred Stock which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (unless such request is received less than 90 days\nbefore the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each\nsubsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated from past dividend periods and the then current dividend period have been paid (or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for payment set apart). A quorum for any such meeting will exist if at least a majority of the total outstanding\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series C Preferred Stock entitled to like\nvoting rights are represented in person or by proxy at that meeting. The directors elected as described above will be elected upon the\naffirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock and preferred stock equal in rank with the\nSeries C Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, present and voting in person or by proxy at a duly called and held meeting at\nwhich a quorum is present. If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series C\nPreferred Stock have been paid in full or declared or set apart for payment in full the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock will be divested of\nthe right to elect directors and, if all dividend arrearages have been paid in full or declared and set apart for payment in full on all series of\npreferred stock entitled to like voting rights, the term of office of each director so elected will terminate. Any director so elected may be\nremoved at any time with or without cause by, and may not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the\noutstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock having the voting rights described above, voting separately as a single class with all classes\nor series of preferred stock entitled to like voting rights. So long as a dividend arrearage continues, any vacancy in the office of a director\nelected as described above may be filled by written consent of the director elected as described above who remains in office, or if none remains\nin office, by a vote of the holders of record of the outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described\nabove, voting separately as a single class with all classes or series of preferred stock entitled to like voting rights, by majority vote. These\ndirectors will each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at\nleast two-thirds of the shares of the Series C Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a\nmeeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our charter, including the articles supplementary designating the\nSeries C Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference,\nprivilege or voting power of the Series C Preferred Stock. However, with respect to the occurrence of any event listed above, so long as the\nSeries C Preferred Stock remains outstanding (or shares issued by a surviving entity in substitution for the Series C Preferred Stock) with its\nterms materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such an event, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence\nof any such event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of the\nSeries C Preferred Stock. In addition (i) any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series C Preferred Stock, (ii) any increase in the\nnumber of authorized shares of preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any other class or series of preferred stock or (iii) any increase in\nthe number of authorized shares of such class or series, in each case ranking equal with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to\npayment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will not be deemed to materially and adversely\naffect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be\nrequired is effected, all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and\nsufficient funds have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for the Series C Preferred Stock is Computershare, Inc.\nSeries D Preferred Stock\nDividends\nHolders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if, authorized by our Board of Directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the Board) and declared by us, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, preferential cumulative\ncash dividends at the rate of 5.00% per annum of the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.25\nper share).\nDividends on shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are cumulative from (but excluding) the date of original issue and are payable monthly in\narrears, on or about the fifth day of each month for dividends accrued the previous month or such date as our Board of Directors may designate,\nto holders of record as they appear in our stock records at the close of business on the applicable record date. The record date for each dividend\nwill be designated by our Board of Directors and will be a date that is prior to the dividend payment date.\nOur Board of Directors will not authorize, and we will not declare, pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of Series D Preferred\nStock at any time that the terms and provisions of any of our agreements, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness, prohibits that\naction or provides that the authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment of those dividends would constitute a breach of or a\ndefault under any such agreement, or if such action is restricted or prohibited by law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not (1) restrictions exist in respect\nthereof, (2) we have earnings, (3) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, or (4) our Board of Directors authorizes\nor we declare such dividends. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock will not bear interest, and holders of the\nSeries D Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any distributions in excess of full cumulative dividends described above.\nIf we do not declare and either pay or set apart for payment the full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock and all shares of\ncapital stock that are equal in rank with Series D Preferred Stock (including shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock\nand Series E Preferred Stock), the amount which we have declared will be allocated ratably to the Series D Preferred Stock and to each series\nof shares of capital stock equal in rank so that the amount declared for each share of Series D Preferred Stock and for each share of each series\nof capital stock equal in rank is proportionate to the accrued and unpaid dividends per share on those shares.\nExcept as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock have been or\ncontemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment is set apart for payment) for all past dividend\nperiods, no dividends (other than in shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to\ndividends and upon liquidation) will be declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment nor will any other distribution be declared and\nmade\nupon our common stock, or any of our other capital stock ranking junior to or on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or\nupon liquidation, nor will we redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire for any consideration (or pay or make any monies available for a sinking\nfund for the redemption of any such shares) any shares of our common stock, or any other shares of\nour capital stock ranking junior to or on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation (except by conversion into\nor exchange for any of our capital stock ranking junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation or redemption for\nthe purpose of preserving our qualification as a REIT).\nHolders of shares of the Series D Preferred Stock are not entitled to any distribution, whether payable in cash, property or shares of capital\nstock, in excess of full cumulative dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock as described above; however, if we fail to redeem or call for\nredemption the Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to the mandatory redemption required on January 31, 2026, the dividend rate on the Series D\nPreferred Stock will increase by 3.0% per share per annum to 8.0%, until such shares are redeemed or called for redemption. Any dividend\npayment made on the Series D Preferred Stock will first be credited against the earliest accumulated but unpaid dividends due with respect to\nthose shares which remain payable. Accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock will accumulate as of the dividend payment\ndate on which they first become payable.\nRedemption\nMandatory Redemption\nWe are required to redeem the Series D Preferred Stock on January 31, 2026 at a redemption price of $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to\naccumulated but unpaid dividends thereon up to but excluding January 31, 2026.\nOptional Redemption\nAt our sole option upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ written notice, we may redeem shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, in\nwhole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accumulated\nand unpaid dividends thereon to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without interest. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series\nD Preferred Stock has been given and if we have deposited the funds necessary for such redemption with the paying agent for the benefit of the\nholders of any of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed, then from and after the date of such deposit dividends will cease to\naccumulate on those shares of Series D Preferred Stock, those shares of Series D Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all\nrights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding Series D\nPreferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall be selected ratably by lot or by any other fair and\nequitable method that the Board may choose.\nUnless full cumulative dividends for all applicable past dividend periods on all shares of Series D Preferred Stock and any shares of stock that\nrank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum\nsufficient for payment set apart for payment or deposited with the applicable paying agent for all past dividend periods), no shares of Series D\nPreferred Stock will be redeemed. However, the foregoing will not prevent us from purchasing shares pursuant to our charter, in order to ensure\nthat we continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or from acquiring shares of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to a\npurchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock and any shares of stock\nthat rank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation.\nWe will deliver a notice of redemption, by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically to holders thereof, or request\nour agent, on behalf of us, to promptly do so by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically. The notice will be\nprovided not less than 15 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such notice. Each such notice will state: (A) the date\nfor redemption; (B) the number of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (C) the CUSIP number for the Series D Preferred Stock; (D) the\napplicable redemption price on a per share basis; (E) if applicable, the place or places where the certificate(s) for such shares are to be\nsurrendered for payment of the price for redemption; (F) that dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to\naccumulate from and after such date of redemption; and (G) the applicable provisions of our charter under which such redemption is made. If\nfewer than all shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice delivered to such holder will also specify the number of Series D\nPreferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder or the method of determining such number. We may provide in any such notice that such\nredemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent and that we will not be required to affect such redemption unless each such condition\nhas been satisfied at the time or times and in the manner specified in such notice. No defect in the notice or delivery thereof will affect the\nvalidity of redemption proceedings, except as required by applicable law.\nIf a redemption date falls after a record date and prior to the corresponding dividend payment date, however, each holder of Series D Preferred\nStock at the close of business on that record date will be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend\npayment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before the dividend payment date.\nChange of Control\nIf a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs with respect to the Series D Preferred Stock, unless we have exercised our option to redeem\nsuch Series D Preferred Stock as described above, holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will have the right to require us to redeem (a\n“Change of Control Redemption”) the Series D Preferred Stock at a price equal to the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an\namount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the date of payment, but without interest (a “Change of Control\nPayment”). Within 30 days following any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at our option, prior to any Change of Control Triggering\nEvent, but after public announcement of the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event, a notice will\nbe mailed to holders of the Series D Preferred Stock, describing the transaction that constitutes or may constitute the Change of Control\nTriggering Event and offering to redeem such Series D Preferred Stock on the date specified in the applicable notice, which date will be no\nearlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (a “Change of Control Payment Date”). The notice will, if\nmailed prior to the date of consummation of the Change of Control Triggering Event, state that the Change of Control Redemption is\nconditioned on the Change of Control Triggering Event occurring on or prior to the applicable Change of Control Payment Date.\nWe will not be required to make a Change of Control Redemption upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party\nmakes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for an offer made by us and the third party\nredeems all Series D Preferred Stock properly tendered and not withdrawn under its offer.\nWe will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the\nextent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock as a result of a Change of\nControl Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any such securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control\nRedemption provisions of the Series D\nPreferred Stock, we will comply with those securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached our obligations under the\nChange of Control Redemption provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock by virtue of any such conflict.\nFor purposes of the foregoing discussion of the redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock at the option of the holders, the following\ndefinitions are applicable.\n“Capital Stock” of a corporation means the capital stock of every class whether now or hereafter authorized, regardless of whether such capital\nstock shall be limited to a fixed sum or percentage with respect to the rights of the holders thereof to participate in dividends and in the\ndistribution of assets upon the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of such corporation.\n“Change of Control Triggering Event” means the occurrence of any of the following: (1) the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance\nor other disposition (other than by way of merger or consolidation), in one or more series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of our\nassets and the assets of our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person, other than us or one of our subsidiaries; (2) the consummation of any\ntransaction (including, without limitation, any merger or consolidation) the result of which is that any Person becomes the beneficial owner (as\ndefined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of our outstanding Voting Stock or other\nVoting Stock into which our Voting Stock is reclassified, consolidated, exchanged or changed, measured by voting power rather than number\nof shares; (3) we consolidate with, or merge with or into, any Person, or any Person consolidates with, or merges with or into, us, in any such\nevent pursuant to a transaction in which any of our outstanding Voting Stock or the Voting Stock of such other Person is converted into or\nexchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than any such transaction where the shares of our Voting Stock outstanding immediately\nprior to such transaction constitute, or are converted into or exchanged for, a majority of the Voting Stock of the surviving Person or any direct\nor indirect parent company of the surviving Person immediately after giving effect to such transaction; (4) the first day on which a majority of\nthe members of our Board of Directors are not Continuing Directors; or (5) the adoption of a plan relating to our liquidation or dissolution.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a transaction will not be deemed to involve a Change of Control Triggering Event under clause (2) above if (i)\nwe become a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company and (ii)(A) the direct or indirect holders of the Voting Stock of\nsuch holding company immediately following that transaction are substantially the same as the holders of our Voting Stock immediately prior\nto that transaction or (B) immediately following that transaction no Person (other than a holding company satisfying the requirements of this\nsentence) is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the Voting Stock of such holding company.\n“Continuing Directors” means, as of any date of determination, any member of our Board of Directors who (A) was a member of such Board of\nDirectors on the date the Series D Preferred Stock was issued or (B) was nominated for election, elected or appointed to such Board of\nDirectors with the approval of a majority of the continuing directors who were members of such Board of Directors at the time of such\nnomination, election or appointment (either by a specific vote or by approval of a proxy statement in which such member was named as a\nnominee for election as a director, without objection to such nomination).\n“Person” has the meaning given thereto in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act.\n“Voting Stock” means, with respect to any specified Person that is a corporation as of any date, the Capital Stock of such Person that is at the\ntime entitled to vote generally in the election of the Board of Directors of such Person.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock will be\nentitled to be paid, out of our assets legally available\nfor distribution to our stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid\ndividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date of payment, but without interest, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of our\ncommon stock or any other class or series of our capital stock that ranks junior to the Series D Preferred Stock as to liquidation rights. If our\nassets legally available for distribution to stockholders are insufficient to pay in full the liquidation preference on the Series D Preferred Stock\nand the liquidation preference on any shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series D Preferred Stock, all assets distributed to the\nholders of Series D Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock will be distributed\nratably so that the amount of assets distributed per share of Series D Preferred Stock and such other series of preferred stock equal in rank with\nthe Series D Preferred Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that the liquidation preference per share on the Series D\nPreferred Stock and on such other series of preferred stock bear to each other. Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up\nof us, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances will be payable,\nwill be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each\nrecord holder of the Series D Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same appear on the stock transfer records of the\nCompany. After payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to\nwhich they are entitled, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. If we convert into or\nconsolidate or merge with or into any other corporation, trust or entity, effect a statutory share exchange or sell, lease, transfer or convey all or\nsubstantially all of our property or business, we will not be deemed to have liquidated, dissolved or wound up.\nRank\nThe Series D Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:\n• senior to all classes or series of our common stock and any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking\njunior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• on parity with our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock and any future class or series of our\ncapital stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• junior to any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect\nto dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, none of which exists on the date hereof; and\n• junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of the Series D Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as described below. Whenever dividends on any shares of Series\nD Preferred Stock are in arrears for 18 or more consecutive months, then the holders of those shares together with the holders of all other series\nof preferred stock equal in rank with the Series D Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will\nbe entitled to vote separately as a class for the election of a total of two additional directors on our Board of Directors.\nThe election of these directors will take place at a special meeting called upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the\noutstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock or holders of record of at least 20% of any class or series of preferred stock equal in rank with\nthe Series D Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (unless such request is received less than 90\ndays before the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each\nsubsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated from past dividend periods and the then current dividend period have been paid (or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for payment set apart). A quorum for any such meeting will exist if at least a majority of the total outstanding\nshares of Series D Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series D Preferred Stock entitled to like\nvoting rights are represented in person or by proxy at that meeting. The directors elected as described above will be elected upon the\naffirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of Series D Preferred Stock and such preferred stock equal in rank with\nthe Series D Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, present and voting in person or by proxy at a duly called and held meeting at\nwhich a quorum is present. If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series D\nPreferred Stock have been paid in full or declared or set apart for payment in full the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will be divested of\nthe right to elect directors and, if all dividend arrearages have been paid in full or declared and set apart for payment in full on all series of\npreferred stock entitled to like voting rights, the term of office of each director so elected will terminate. Any director so elected may be\nremoved at any time with or without cause by, and may not be removed otherwise than by the vote of, the holders of record of a majority of the\ntotal outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock having the voting rights described above and outstanding shares of all classes of series of\npreferred stock entitled to like voting rights, voting separately as a single class.

These directors will each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at\nleast two-thirds of the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a\nmeeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our charter, including the articles supplementary designating the\nSeries D Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference,\nprivilege or voting power of the Series D Preferred Stock. However, with respect to the occurrence of any event listed above, so long as the\nSeries D Preferred Stock remains outstanding (or shares issued by a surviving entity in substitution for the Series D Preferred Stock) with its\nterms materially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such an event, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence\nof any such event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of the\nSeries D Preferred Stock. In addition (i) any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series D Preferred Stock, (ii) any increase in the\nnumber of authorized shares of preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any other class or series of preferred stock or (iii) any increase in\nthe number of authorized shares of such class or series, in each case ranking equal with or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to\npayment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will not be deemed to materially and adversely\naffect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be\nrequired is effected, all outstanding shares of Series D\nPreferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds have been deposited in trust to effect such\nredemption.\nConversion\nThe Series D Preferred Stock is not convertible into or exchangeable for any of our other property or securities.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for the Series D Preferred Stock is Computershare, Inc.\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nDividends\nHolders of shares of the Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our Board of Directors (or a duly\nauthorized committee of the board) and declared by us, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, preferential cumulative\ncash dividends at the rate of 5.00% per annum of the liquidation preference of $25.00 per share (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.25\nper share).\nDividends on shares of the Series E Preferred Stock will accrue and be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.\nDividends on outstanding shares of the Series E Preferred Stock will accrue and be cumulative from the end of the most recent dividend period\nfor which dividends have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid, from the date of issuance. If a share of Series E Preferred Stock is\nissued after the Dividend Record Date (as defined below) for the dividend period in which such share is issued, dividends on such share shall\naccrue and be cumulative from the beginning of the first dividend period commencing after its issuance. Dividends will be payable monthly in\narrears, on or about the fifth day of each month for dividends accrued the previous month or such other date as our Board of Directors may\ndesignate, to holders of record as they appear in our stock records at the close of business on the applicable record date. The record date for\neach dividend will be designated by our Board of Directors and will be a date that is prior to the dividend payment date.\nOur Board of Directors will not authorize, and we will not declare, pay or set apart for payment, any dividends on shares of Series E Preferred\nStock at any time that the terms and provisions of any of our agreements, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness, prohibits that\naction or provides that the authorization, declaration, payment or setting apart for payment of those dividends would constitute a breach of or a\ndefault under any such agreement, or if such action is restricted or prohibited by law.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock will accumulate whether or not (1) restrictions exist in respect\nthereof, (2) we have earnings, (3) there are funds legally available for the payment of such dividends, or (4) our Board of Directors authorizes\nor we declare such dividends. Accumulated but unpaid dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock will not bear interest, and holders of the\nSeries E Preferred Stock will not be entitled to any distributions in excess of full cumulative dividends described above.\nIf we do not declare and either pay or set apart for payment the full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock and all shares of\ncapital stock that are equal in rank with Series E Preferred Stock (including shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock\nand Series D Preferred Stock), the amount which we have declared will be allocated ratably to the Series E Preferred Stock and to each series\nof shares of capital stock equal in rank so that the\namount declared for each share of Series E Preferred Stock and for each share of each series of capital stock equal in rank is proportionate to\nthe accrued and unpaid dividends on those shares.\nExcept as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph, unless full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock have been or\ncontemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment is set apart for payment) for all past dividend\nperiods, no dividends (other than in shares of common stock or other shares of capital stock ranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to\ndividends and upon liquidation) will be declared and paid or declared and set apart for payment nor will any other distribution be declared and\nmade upon our common stock, or any of our other capital stock ranking junior to or equal with the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or\nupon liquidation, nor will we redeem, purchase, or otherwise acquire for any consideration (or pay or make any monies available for a sinking\nfund for the redemption of any such shares) any shares of our common stock, or any other shares of our capital stock ranking junior to or equal\nwith the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation (except by conversion into or exchange for any of our capital stock\nranking junior to the Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation or redemption for the purpose of preserving our\nqualification as a REIT).\nRanking\nThe Series E Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:\n• senior to all classes or series of our common stock and any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking\njunior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• on parity with our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock and any future class or series of our\ncapital stock expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to dividend rights and rights upon\nliquidation, dissolution or winding up;\n• junior to any future class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect\nto dividend rights or rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, none of which exists on the date hereof; and\n• junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness.\nRedemption by Stockholders\nOptional Redemption Following Death of a Holder\nSubject to the restrictions described under “-Stockholder Redemption Option,” and the terms and procedures described below under “-\nRedemption Procedures,” commencing on the date of original issuance and terminating upon the listing of the Series E Preferred Stock on\nNasdaq or another national securities exchange, shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by a natural person upon his or her death will be\nredeemed at the written request of the holder’s estate for a cash payment of $25.00 per share of Series E Preferred Stock on the Death\nRedemption Date, which is the tenth calendar day following delivery of such holder’s estate’s request to redeem shares of the Series E\nPreferred Stock, or if such tenth calendar day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day.\nStockholder Redemption Option\nSubject to the restrictions described herein, and the terms and procedures described below under “-Redemption Procedures,” commencing on\nthe date of original issuance (or, if after the date of original issuance our Board of Directors suspends the redemption program of the holders of\nthe Series E Preferred Stock, on the date our Board of Directors reinstates such program) and terminating on the earlier to occur of (1) the date\nupon which our Board of Directors, by resolution, suspends or terminates the redemption program, and (2) the date on which shares of the\nSeries E Preferred Stock are listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, holders of the Series E Preferred Stock may, at their\noption, require us to redeem any or all of their shares of Series E Preferred Stock for a cash payment of $22.50 per share of Series E Preferred\nStock on the Stockholder Redemption Date, which is the tenth calendar day following delivery of such holder’s request to redeem shares of the\nSeries E Preferred Stock, or if such tenth calendar day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day. The maximum dollar amount\nthat we will make available each calendar year to redeem shares of Series E Preferred Stock will not be subject to an annual limit; provided,\nthat our obligation to redeem shares of Series E Preferred Stock is limited to the extent that our Board of Directors determines, in its sole and\nabsolute discretion, that we do not have sufficient funds available to fund any such redemption or we are restricted by applicable law from\nmaking such redemption; and is also limited to the extent our Board of Directors suspends or terminates the optional redemption right at any\ntime or for any reason, including after delivery of a Stockholder Redemption Notice but prior to the corresponding Stockholder Redemption\nDate.\nRedemption Procedures\nTo require us to redeem shares of Series E Preferred Stock, a holder or estate of a holder, as applicable, must deliver a notice of redemption, by\novernight delivery or by first class mail, postage prepaid to us at our principal executive offices. Each such notice must be an original, notarized\ncopy and must state: (1) the name and address of the stockholder whose shares of Series E Preferred Stock are requested to be redeemed, (2)\nthe number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock requested to be redeemed, (3) the name of the broker dealer who holds the shares of Series E\nPreferred Stock requested to be redeemed, the stockholder’s account number with such broker dealer and such broker dealer’s participant\nnumber for DTC and (4) in the case of a notice to redeem upon the death of a holder, a certified copy of the death certificate (and such other\nevidence that is satisfactory to us in our sole discretion) for the natural person who previously held the shares to be redeemed.\nIf, as a result of the limitations described under “-Stockholder Redemption Option,” the optional redemption right has not been suspended or\nterminated but fewer than all shares for which a notice of redemption was delivered to us are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be\nredeemed will be pro rata based on the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock for which each holder timely submitted a notice of\nredemption. If a Stockholder Redemption Date is also a Death Redemption Date, the limitations described under “-Stockholder Redemption\nOption” shall first be applied to any redemption requested upon the death of the holder and then to shares to be redeemed pursuant to the\nStockholder Redemption Option.\nUpon any redemption of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the holder thereof will also be entitled to receive a sum equal to all accumulated\nand unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the applicable Stockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date (unless such\nStockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date falls after a dividend record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend\npayment date, in which case each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock on such dividend record date will be entitled to the dividend\npayable on such shares on the corresponding dividend payment date, notwithstanding the redemption of such shares on or prior to such\ndividend payment date, and each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock that are redeemed on such Stockholder Redemption Date or\nDeath Redemption Date will be entitled to the dividends, if any, occurring after the end of the dividend period to which such\ndividend payment date relates up to, but excluding, the Stockholder Redemption Date or Death Redemption Date, as the case may be). Upon\nthe redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock, such shares of Series E Preferred Stock will cease to be outstanding, dividends with\nrespect to such shares of Series E Preferred Stock will cease to accumulate and all rights whatsoever with respect to such shares (except the\nright to receive the per share cash payment for the redeeming shares) will terminate.\nWe may suspend or terminate the redemption program at any time in our sole discretion.\nOptional Redemption by the Company\nExcept in certain limited circumstances relating to maintaining our qualification as a REIT as described in “-Restrictions on Ownership and\nTransfer,” we cannot redeem the Series E Preferred Stock prior to the later of (1) first anniversary of the Termination Date and (2) January 1,\n2026.\nOn and after the later of (1) first anniversary of the Termination Date and (2) January 1, 2026, at our sole option upon not less than 30 nor\nmore than 60 days’ written notice, we may redeem shares of the Series E Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time,\nfor cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to, but\nexcluding, the date fixed for redemption, without interest. Holders of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed must then surrender such Series\nE Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice. Upon surrender of the Series E Preferred Stock, the holders will be entitled to the\nredemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock has been given and if we have deposited the funds\nnecessary for such redemption with the paying agent for the benefit of the holders of any of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be\nredeemed, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series E Preferred Stock, those\nshares of Series E Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the\nright to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding Series E Preferred Stock is to be redeemed, the Series E Preferred Stock\nto be redeemed will be selected (1) pro rata, (2) by lot or (3) by any other fair and equitable method that our Board of Directors may choose.\nUnless full cumulative dividends for all applicable past dividend periods on all shares of Series E Preferred Stock and any shares of stock that\nrank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation have been or contemporaneously are declared and paid (or declared and a sum\nsufficient for payment set apart for payment), no shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be redeemed. In such event, we also will not purchase\nor otherwise acquire directly or indirectly any shares of Series E Preferred Stock (except by exchange for our capital stock ranking junior to the\nSeries E Preferred Stock as to dividends and upon liquidation). However, the foregoing will not prevent us from purchasing shares pursuant to\nour charter, in order to ensure that we continue to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or from acquiring shares of Series E\nPreferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made on the same terms to holders of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred\nStock and any shares of stock that rank on parity with regards to dividends and upon liquidation. Upon listing, if any, of the Series E Preferred\nStock on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, so long as no dividends are in arrears, we will be entitled at any time and from time to\ntime to repurchase shares of Series E Preferred Stock in open-market transactions duly authorized by the Board of Directors and effected in\ncompliance with applicable laws.\nWe will deliver a notice of redemption, by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically to holders thereof, or request\nour agent, on behalf of us, to promptly do so by overnight delivery, by first class mail, postage prepaid or electronically. The notice will be\nprovided not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for redemption in such notice. Each such notice will state: (1) the date\nfor redemption; (2) the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed; (3) the CUSIP number for the Series E Preferred Stock;\n(4) the applicable redemption price on a per share basis; (5) if applicable, the place or places where the certificate(s) for such shares are to be\nsurrendered for payment of the price for redemption; (6) that dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed will cease to\naccumulate from and after such date of redemption; and (7) the applicable provisions of our charter under which such redemption is made. If\nfewer than all shares held by any holder are to be redeemed, the notice delivered to such holder will also specify the number of Series E\nPreferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder or the method of determining such number. We may provide in any such notice that such\nredemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent and that we will not be required to effect such redemption unless each such condition\nhas been satisfied at the time or times and in the manner specified in such notice. No defect in the notice or delivery thereof will affect the\nvalidity of redemption proceedings, except as required by applicable law.\nIf a redemption date falls after a record date and on or prior to the corresponding dividend payment date, each holder of Series E Preferred\nStock at the close of business on that record date will be entitled to the dividend payable on such shares on the corresponding dividend\npayment date notwithstanding the redemption of such shares before the dividend payment date, each holder of shares Series E Preferred Stock\nthat are redeemed on such redemption date will be entitled to the dividends, if any, accruing after the end of the dividend period for which such\ndividend payment date relates up to, but excluding, the redemption date.\nLiquidation Preference\nIn the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be\nentitled to be paid, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share, plus an\namount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date of payment, but without interest, before any\ndistribution of assets is made to holders of our common stock or any other class or series of our capital stock that ranks junior to the Series E\nPreferred Stock as to liquidation rights. If our assets legally available for distribution to stockholders are insufficient to pay in full the\nliquidation preference on the Series E Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference on any shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the\nSeries E Preferred Stock, all assets distributed to the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock and any other series of preferred stock equal in\nrank with the Series E Preferred Stock will be distributed ratably so that the amount of assets distributed per share of Series E Preferred Stock\nand such other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series E Preferred Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that\nthe liquidation preference per share on the Series E Preferred Stock and on such other series of preferred stock bear to each other. Written\nnotice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the\namounts distributable in such circumstances will be payable, will be given by first class mail, postage pre-paid, not less than 30 nor more than\n60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series E Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such\nholders as the same appear on the stock transfer records of the Company. After payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference, plus\nan amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to which they are entitled, the holders of Series E Preferred Stock will have no right\nor claim to any of our remaining assets. If we convert into or consolidate or merge with or into any other corporation, trust or entity, effect a\nstatutory share exchange or sell, lease, transfer or convey all or substantially all of our property or business, we will not be deemed to have\nliquidated, dissolved or wound up.\nVoting Rights\nHolders of the Series E Preferred Stock will not have any voting rights, except as described below.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of Series E Preferred Stock are in arrears for 18 or more consecutive months, then the holders of those\nshares together with the holders of all other series of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series E Preferred Stock upon which like voting\nrights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote separately as a class for the election of a total of two additional directors\non our Board of Directors.\nThe election of these directors will take place at a special meeting called upon the written request of the holders of record of at least 20% of the\noutstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock or holders of record of at least 20% of any class or series of preferred stock equal in rank with\nthe Series E Preferred Stock which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (unless such request is received less than 90 days\nbefore the date fixed for the next annual or special meeting of stockholders) or at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and at each\nsubsequent annual meeting until all dividends accumulated from past dividend periods and the then current dividend period have been paid (or\ndeclared and a sum sufficient for payment set apart). A quorum for any such meeting will exist if at least a majority of the total outstanding\nshares of Series E Preferred Stock and outstanding shares of preferred stock equal in rank with the Series E Preferred Stock entitled to like\nvoting rights are represented in person or by proxy at that meeting. The directors elected as described above will be elected upon the\naffirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock and preferred stock equal in rank with the\nSeries E Preferred Stock, voting separately as a single class, present and voting in person or by proxy at a duly called and held meeting at\nwhich a quorum is present. If and when all accumulated dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the Series E\nPreferred Stock have been paid in full or declared or set apart for payment in full the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will be divested of\nthe right to elect directors and, if all dividend arrearages have been paid in full or declared and set apart for payment in full on all series of\npreferred stock entitled to like voting rights, the term of office of each director so elected will terminate. Any director so elected may be\nremoved at any time with or without cause by, and may not be removed otherwise than by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes\nentitled to be cast collectively by the holders of record of the outstanding shares of the Series E Preferred Stock having the voting rights\ndescribed above and the holders of all classes or\nseries of preferred stock entitled to like voting rights (voting separately as a single class). So long as a dividend arrearage continues, any\nvacancy in the office of a director elected as described above may be filled by written consent of the director elected as described above who\nremains in office, or if none remains in office, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast collectively by the holders of\nrecord of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock when they have the voting rights described above and the holders of all classes or\nseries of preferred stock entitled to like voting rights, by majority vote (voting separately as a single class). These directors will each be entitled\nto one vote per director on any matter.\nSo long as any shares of Series E Preferred Stock remain outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at\nleast two-thirds of the shares of the Series E Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or at a\nmeeting (voting separately as a class), amend, alter or repeal the provisions of our charter, including the articles supplementary designating the\nSeries E Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference, privilege\nor voting power of the Series E Preferred Stock. However, with respect to the occurrence of any event listed above, so long as the Series E\nPreferred Stock remains outstanding (or shares issued by a surviving entity in substitution for the Series E Preferred Stock) with its terms\nmaterially unchanged, taking into account that upon the occurrence of such an event, we may not be the surviving entity, the occurrence of any\nsuch event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting power of holders of\nthe Series E Preferred Stock. In addition (i) any increase in the number of authorized shares of Series E Preferred Stock, (ii) any increase in the\nnumber of authorized shares of preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any other class or series of preferred stock or (iii) any increase in\nthe number of authorized shares of such class or series, in each case ranking equal with or junior to the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to\npayment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will not be deemed to materially and adversely\naffect such rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers.\nThe foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which such vote would otherwise be\nrequired is effected, all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock have been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and\nsufficient funds have been deposited in trust to effect such redemption.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent and registrar for the Series E Preferred Stock is Computershare, Inc.\nListing\nWe intend to apply to list the Series E Preferred Stock on Nasdaq within one calendar year of the Termination Date (as defined in the Articles\nSupplementary setting forth the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock). There can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such\ntimeframe, or at all.\nCERTAIN PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW AND OF OUR CHARTER AND BYLAWS\nClassification of our Board of Directors\nOur board of directors is currently comprised of eight members. Our board is divided into three classes of directors. Directors of each class are\nelected for a term expiring at the third annual meeting following their election and until their respective successor is duly elected and qualifies,\nand each year one class of directors will be elected by the stockholders. Our board of directors has the sole power to fill any vacancy on the\nboard of directors and any director elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the full term of the class in which the vacancy\noccurred and until a successor is elected and qualifies. We believe that classification of our board of directors helps to assure the continuity and\nstability of our business strategies and policies as determined by our directors. Holders of shares of our common stock have no right to\ncumulative voting in the election of directors. Consequently, at each annual meeting of stockholders, the holders of a majority of the capital\nstock entitled to vote are able to elect all of the successors of the class of directors whose terms expire at that meeting.\nOur classified board could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult. At least two\nannual meetings of stockholders, instead of one, will generally be required to effect a change in a majority of our board of directors. Thus, our\nclassified board could increase the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions. The staggered terms of directors may delay,\ndefer or prevent a tender offer or an attempt to change control of us or another transaction that might involve a premium price for our common\nstock that might be in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRemoval of Directors\nAny director may be removed only for cause by the stockholders upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be\ncast generally in the election of directors.\nRestrictions on Ownership and Transfer\nTo qualify and maintain status as a REIT, not more than 50% of our outstanding shares may be owned by any five or fewer individuals\n(including some tax-exempt entities) during the last half of each taxable year, and the outstanding shares must be owned by 100 or more\npersons independent of us and each other during at least 335 days of a 12-month taxable year or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable\nyear for which an election to be treated as a REIT is made. These requirements do not apply to us for our first taxable year for which we elect\nto be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In order to assist our board of directors in becoming a REIT and preserving our status as\na REIT, among other purposes, our charter contains ownership limits which prohibit any person or group of persons from acquiring, directly or\nindirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 3.3% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock or more than 3.3% in value or in number\nof shares (whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock, other than David Gladstone, who currently owns\napproximately 7.2% of our outstanding capital stock, and the Gladstone Future Trust, that currently owns approximately 1.9% of our\noutstanding capital stock, and certain qualified institutional investors who may own up to 9.8%.\nThe 3.3% ownership limit does not apply to any underwriter, placement agent or initial purchaser that participates in a public offering, a private\nplacement or other private offering of our capital stock (or securities convertible or exchangeable for capital stock) in a public offering of our\nshares, only to the extent necessary to facilitate such offering.\nDistributions\nDistributions will be paid to stockholders as of the record date selected by our board of directors. We generally pay distributions on a monthly\nbasis regardless of the frequency with which such distributions are declared. To qualify as a REIT, we are required to make distributions\nsufficient to satisfy the REIT requirements. Generally, income distributed as distributions will not be taxable to us under federal income tax\nlaws unless we fail to comply with the REIT requirements.\nDistributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors based on our earnings, cash flow and general financial condition. The\ndirectors’ discretion will be governed, in substantial part, by their obligation to cause us to comply with the REIT requirements. Because we\nmay receive income from interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions may not reflect our income earned in that\nparticular distribution period but may be made in anticipation of cash flow which we expect to receive during a later month and may be made\nin advance of actual receipt in an attempt to make distributions relatively uniform. We may borrow to make distributions if the borrowing is\nnecessary to maintain our REIT status, or if the borrowing is part of a liquidation strategy whereby the borrowing is done in anticipation of the\nsale of properties and the proceeds will be used to repay the loan.\nInformation Rights\nAny stockholder may, during normal business hours and for any lawful and proper purpose, inspect and copy our bylaws, minutes of the\nproceedings of our stockholders meetings, our annual statement of affairs and any voting trust agreement that is on file at our principal office.\nIn addition, one or more stockholders who together are, and for at least six months have been, record or beneficial holders of 5% of any class of\nour stock are entitled to inspect our books of accounts or a copy of our stockholder list upon written request. The list will include the name\nand address of, and the number of shares owned by, each stockholder and will be available at our principal office within 20 days of the\nstockholder’s request.\nThe rights of stockholders described above are in addition to, and do not adversely affect rights provided to investors under, Rule 14a-7\npromulgated under the Exchange Act. Rule 14a-7 provides that, upon request of investors and the payment of the expenses of the distribution,\nwe are required to distribute specific materials to stockholders in the context of the solicitation of proxies for voting on matters presented to\nstockholders, or, at our option, provide requesting stockholders with a copy of the list of stockholders so that the requesting stockholders may\nmake the distribution themselves.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe MGCL prohibits “business combinations” between a corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder\nfor five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. These business combinations\ninclude a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange, or, in circumstances specified in the statute, certain transfers of assets, certain stock\nissuances and transfers, liquidation plans and reclassifications involving interested stockholders and their affiliates. The MGCL defines an\ninterested stockholder as:\n• any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock; or\n• an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the\nbeneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding stock of the corporation.\n• A person is not an interested stockholder if the board of directors approves in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise\nwould have become an interested stockholder. However, in approving the transaction, the board of directors may provide that its\napproval is subject to compliance, at or after the time of approval, with any terms and conditions determined by the board of directors.\nAfter the five-year prohibition, any business combination between a corporation and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended\nby the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:\n• 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the then outstanding shares of voting stock; and\n• two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of the voting stock other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom\nor with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or shares held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.\nThese super-majority vote requirements do not apply if the common stockholders receive a minimum price, as defined under the MGCL, for\ntheir shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are approved by the board of directors before\nthe time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder.\nSubtitle 8\nSubtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at\nleast three independent directors to elect to be subject, by provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and\nnotwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of five provisions:\n• a classified board of directors;\n• a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director;\n• a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors;\n• a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of\ndirectors in which the vacancy occurred; and\n• a majority requirement for the calling by stockholders of a special meeting of stockholders.\nThrough provisions in our charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, we already (a) have a classified board, (b) require a two-thirds vote for\nthe removal of any director from the board, (c) vest in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of directorships and (d) require, unless\ncalled by our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, a majority of our directors or a majority of our independent directors, the\nrequest of stockholders entitled to cast not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast to call a special meeting. We have elected that,\nexcept as may be provided by our board of directors in setting the terms of any class or series of stock, any and all vacancies on the board may\nbe filled only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors in office, even if the remaining directors do not constitute a\nquorum, and any director elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the class in which such vacancy occurred and\nuntil his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies.\nAmendments to Our Charter and Bylaws\nExcept for amendments to the provisions of our charter relating to the removal of directors and the restrictions on ownership and transfer of our\nshares of stock and the vote required to amend these provisions (each of which must be advised by our board of directors and approved by the\naffirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast not less than two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter), our charter generally\nmay be amended only if approved and advised by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a\nmajority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nOur board of directors has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of our bylaws and to make new bylaws.\nExtraordinary Transactions\nUnder the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, merge, sell all or substantially all of its assets, convert into another entity,\nengage in a statutory share exchange or engage in similar transactions outside the ordinary course of business unless approved by the\naffirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but\nnot less than a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporation’s charter. As permitted by the MGCL,\nour charter provides that any of these actions except for the charter amendments described above\nmay be approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.\nOperations\nWe generally are prohibited from engaging in certain activities, including acquiring or holding property or engaging in any activity that would\ncause us to fail to qualify as a REIT.\nTerm and Termination\nOur charter provides for us to have a perpetual existence. Pursuant to our charter, and subject to the provisions of any of our classes or series of\nstock then outstanding and the approval by a majority of the entire board of directors, our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of\nall of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, may approve a plan of liquidation and dissolution.\nAdvance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business\nOur bylaws provide that, with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of persons for election to our board of directors and\nthe proposal of business to be considered by stockholders at the annual meeting may be made only:\n• pursuant to our notice of the meeting;\n• by or at the direction of our board of directors; or\n• by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of the provision of notice, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who\nhas complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our bylaws.\nWith respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting of\nstockholders and nominations of persons for election to our board of directors at which directors are to be elected pursuant to our notice of the\nmeeting may be made only:\n• by or at the direction of our board of directors; or\n• by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of the provision of notice, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who\nhas complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in our bylaws.\nPower to Issue Additional Shares\nIn the future, we may issue additional securities, including upon the redemption of limited partnership interests that we may issue in connection\nwith acquisitions of real property. We believe that the power to issue additional shares of stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of\ncommon stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and thereafter to issue the classified or reclassified shares provides us with\nincreased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs which might arise. These actions can\nbe taken without stockholder approval, unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or\nautomated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded. Although we have no present intention of doing so, we could issue\na class or series of shares that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in\ncontrol that might involve a premium price for holders of common stock or otherwise be in their best interest.\nControl Share Acquisitions\nThe MGCL provides that a holder of “control shares” of a Maryland corporation acquired in a “control share acquisition” has no voting rights\nwith respect to such shares except to the extent approved at a special meeting by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be\ncast on the matter, excluding shares of stock in a corporation in respect of which any of the following persons is entitled to exercise or direct\nthe exercise of the voting power of shares of stock of the corporation in the election of directors: (i) a person who makes or proposes to make a\ncontrol share acquisition, (ii) an officer of the corporation or (iii) an employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation.\n“Control shares” are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquiror or in\nrespect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would\nentitle the acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of voting power: (i) one-tenth or more but\nless than one-third, (ii) one-third or more but less than a majority, or (iii) a majority or more of all voting power. Control shares do not include\nshares that the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A “control share\nacquisition” means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions.\nA person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking to\npay expenses and delivering an acquiring person statement), may compel our board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be\nheld within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the shares. If no request for a meeting is made, the corporation may itself\npresent the question at any stockholders meeting.\nIf voting rights are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the\nstatute, then, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which\nvoting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the control shares, as\nof the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquiror or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are\nconsidered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a stockholders meeting and the acquiror becomes entitled to\nvote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for\npurposes of such appraisal rights may not be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquiror in the control share acquisition.\nThe control share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation is a\nparty to the transaction or (b) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.\nOur bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions of shares of our stock by David\nGladstone and any of his affiliates. There is no assurance that such provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\nPossible Anti-Takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of Our Charter and Bylaws\nThe business combination provisions and the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL; the classification of our board of directors; the\nrestrictions on the transfer and ownership of stock and the advance notice provisions of our bylaws could have the effect of delaying, deferring\nor\npreventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for holders of common stock or otherwise be in their best\ninterests.\nSECOND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT\nThis SECOND AMENDMENT TO LOAN AGREEMENT (this “Amendment”) is made and entered into as of the __14th_ day of December,\n2023 (the “Effective Date”) by and among GLADSTONE LAND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership (“ Borrower”),\nGLADSTONE LAND CORPORATION, a Maryland corporation (“Guarantor”), and METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, a New\nYork corporation (“Lender”).\nRECITALS\nA.

Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this acknowledgment shall have the\nmeanings ascribed to such terms in the Policy.\nBy signing this acknowledgment, the undersigned acknowledges and agrees that the undersigned is and will continue to be subject to the Policy\nand that the Policy will apply both during and after the undersigned’s employment with the Company Group. Further, by signing below, the undersigned\nagrees to abide by the terms of the Policy, including, without limitation, by returning any Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company Group to\nthe extent required by the Policy.\n______________________________\nSignature\n______________________________\nPrint Name\n______________________________\nDate\n35977419.3\nExhibit 99.2\nPursuant to FINRA Rule 2310(b)(5) and 2231(c), Gladstone Land Corporation (the “Company”) determined the estimated value as of December 31, 2023, of its 5.00% Series E\nCumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series E Preferred Stock”), $25.00 stated value per share, with the assistance of a third-party valuation service. In particular, the\nthird-party valuation service reviewed the amount resulting from the consolidated total equity of the Company (as reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet\nwithin its Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”), which was prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples), adjusted for the fair value of its long-term assets (i.e., its real estate holdings) and long-term liabilities (each as disclosed within the Form 10-K (to which this\nexhibit is attached) under “Non-GAAP Financial Information—Net Asset Value”), divided by the number of shares of the Company's Series E Preferred Stock outstanding.\nBased on this methodology and because the result from the calculation above is greater than the $25.00 per share stated value of the Company's Series E Preferred Stock, the\nCompany has determined that the estimated value of its Series E Preferred Stock as of December 31, 2023, is $25.00 per share."
