The\nviews and strategies described may not be appropriate for all investors. References to specific securities, asset classes and financial markets are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended\nto be, and should not be interpreted as, recommendations.\nIMPORTANT FUND INFORMATION\nInvestments by the Fund(s) in lower-rated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higher-rated securities, including less liquidity and increased price\nsensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment.\nFixed Income Security Risk. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk; as interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline.\nConvertible Securities Risk. The value of a convertible security is influenced by changes in interest rates, with investment value declining as interest rates increase and increasing as interest\nrates decline. The credit standing of the issuer and other factors also, may have an effect on the convertible security’s investment value.\nEquity Securities Risk. Equity investments are subject to greater fluctuations in market value than other asset classes as a result of such factors as the issuer’s business performance, investor\nperceptions, stock market trends and general economic conditions. Equity securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to\ncorporate income and liquidation payments. The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and convertible securities of any rating, including below investment grade.\nShort Selling Risk. The Fund will engage in short sales for investment and risk management purposes, including when the Adviser believes an investment will underperform due to a greater\nsensitivity to earnings growth of the issuer, default risk or interest rates. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, the Fund may not be able, fully or partially,\nto implement its short selling strategy. Periods of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions may exist for extended periods of time. Short sales are transactions in which\nthe Fund sells a security or other instrument that it does not own but can borrow in the market. Short selling allows the Fund to profit from a decline in market price to the extent such decline exceeds\nthe transaction costs and the costs of borrowing the securities and to obtain a low cost means of financing long investments that the Adviser believes are attractive. If a security sold short increases\nin price, the Fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price, resulting in a loss. The Fund will have substantial short positions and must borrow those securities to\nmake delivery to the buyer under the short sale transaction. The Fund may not be able to borrow a security that it needs to deliver or it may not be able to close out a short position at an acceptable\nprice and may have to sell related long positions earlier than it had expected. Thus, the Fund may not be able to successfully implement its short sale strategy due to limited availability of desired\nsecurities or for other reasons.\nLimited Term Risk. Unless the limited term provision of the Fund’s Declaration of Trust is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, or unless the Fund completes the\nEligible Tender Offer and converts to perpetual existence, the Fund will dissolve on the Dissolution Date. The Fund is not a so called “target date” or “life cycle” fund whose asset allocation becomes\nmore conservative over time as its target date, often associated with retirement, approaches. In addition, the Fund is not a “target term” fund whose investment objective is to return its original NAV\non the Dissolution Date. The Fund’s investment objective and policies are not designed to seek to return to investors that purchase Shares in this offering their initial investment of $20.00 per Share on\nthe Dissolution Date or in the Eligible Tender Offer, and such investors and investors that purchase Shares after the completion of this offering may receive more or less than their original investment\nupon dissolution or in the Eligible Tender Offer.\nTERMS\nAlpha is a measurement of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. A positive alpha shows that performance of a portfolio was higher than expected given the risk. A negative alpha shows that the\nperformance was less than expected given the risk.\nBeta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole.\nManaged Distribution Policy is an investment company’s commitment to common shareholders to provide a predictable, but not assured, level of cash flow. Market Price refers to the price\nat which shares of the fund trade in the market. NAV or Net Asset Value refers to the net value of all the assets held in the fund. IPO Price refers to the initial public offering price for shares of the\nfund.\nManaged Assets are the total assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable to any leverage that may be outstanding) minus the sum of liabilities (other than debt representing financial\nleverage).\nLeverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares as well as fluctuations in the variable\nrates of the leverage financing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve or maintain its investment objective.\nOrdinary income includes net investment income and short-term capital gains. The distribution tables provided here are for informational purposes only. Estimates are calculated on a tax basis\nrather than on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis but should not be used for tax reporting purposes. Distributions may be subject to re-characterization for tax purposes\nafter the end of the fiscal year. Individual (non-corporate) shareholders with taxable accounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions via\nForm 1099-DIV. If your distributions are reinvested in additional shares, you will receive a statement reflecting the reinvestment of the distribution.

Morningstar ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a\nfund’s monthly historical performance (reflecting sales charges), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Within each asset class, the top 10%, the next 22.5%,\n35%, 22.5%, and the bottom 10% receive 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 star, respectively. Each fund is rated exclusively against US domiciled funds.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising\nfrom any use of this information. Source: ©2024 Morningstar, Inc.\nMorningstar Convertibles Category funds are designed to offer some of the capital-appreciation potential of stock portfolios while also supplying some of the safety and yield of bond portfolios. To do so,\nthey focus on convertible bonds and convertible preferred stocks. Convertible bonds allow investors to convert the bonds into shares of stock, usually at a preset price. These securities thus act a bit like\nstocks and a bit like bonds.\nMorningstar Moderately Aggressive Allocation Category funds in allocation categories seek to provide both income and capital appreciation by primarily investing in multiple asset classes, including stocks,\nbonds, and cash. These moderately aggressive strategies prioritize capital appreciation over preservation. They typically expect volatility similar to a strategic equity exposure between 70% and 85%.\n2\n18841 1124M R\n1 1 / 3 0 / 2 0 2 4\nC C D In c e p t io n3\n/ 2 7 / 2 0 1 5C\nH I In c e p t io n6\n/ 2 6 / 2 0 0 2C\nH Y In c e p t io n5\n/ 2 8 / 2 0 0 3C\nS Q In c e p t io n3\n/ 2 6 / 2 0 0 4\n:\n:\n:\n:\nM\nM\no r n in\nC o\nC o\nC o\no d e r aA\ng s t a r C a t e\nn v e r tib le s\nn v e r tib le s\nn v e r tib le s\nte ly A g g r ello\nc a tio n\ng o r y\ns s iv e\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nY\n\n\ne\n\n\na r\n\n\n\nN u m b e r o\n9\n9\n9\n5\nf fu n d s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nY\n\n\ne\n\n\na r\n\n\n\n\n\n\nN u m b e r o\n9\n9\n9\n5\nf fu n d s\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n0 Y e\nN / A\n\n\n\na\n\nr\n\n\n\nN u m b e r o\nN / A\n8\n8\n5\nf fu n d s\nAverage Annualized Returns (%) as of 11/30/24 Premium/Discount Summary\n1 year 3 year 5 year 10 year Since Inception\nNAV Mkt NAV Mkt NAV Mkt NAV Mkt NAV Mkt\nCHI (6/26/02) 21.63 34.31 -1.29 3.19 9.38 12.36 7.75 9.04 9.31 9.76\nCHY (5/28/03) 22.16 20.35 -1.13 1.86 9.60 11.90 7.75 8.53 8.70 8.95\nCSQ (3/26/04) 36.49 35.35 9.16 7.11 15.88 15.29 13.04 13.40 10.09 9.71\nCGO (10/27/05) 33.37 43.34 1.97 0.34 10.33 8.07 8.25 8.13 8.50 8.10\nCHW (6/27/07) 33.28 37.25 3.02 -1.46 9.99 6.27 8.28 8.06 6.71 5.75\nCCD (3/27/15) 22.51 40.36 -2.62 2.60 10.29 13.64 --- --- 8.58 9.82\nCPZ (11/29/19) 13.91 20.06 5.40 3.75 6.77 4.56 --- --- 6.76 4.56\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Drawing on experience that dates to the difficult financial\nmarkets of the 1970s, we believe we are well positioned to navigate uncertain market environments through\nactive management. Calamos has been a pioneer in the closed-end industry, having launched our first multi-\nasset closed-end fund in 2002. We have a long track record of meeting distributions and managing leverage.\nA Choice of Funds for the Income-Oriented Investor\nTo address a breadth of asset allocation needs, we offer two broad categories of closed-end funds: enhanced\nfixed income and total return. Enhanced fixed income funds are positioned to pursue high current income and\ncapital gains. Total return funds are positioned to seek current income, with increased emphasis on capital\ngains potential.

There are significant\ndifferences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation among these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. The Fund’s ability to utilize options\nsuccessfully will depend on the ability of the Fund’s investment adviser to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured. Investment Adviser Purchase Risk. As contemplated in the Fund’s prospectus,\nCalamos Advisors LLC (the “Adviser”) has entered into a 10b5-1 Plan under which a registered broker-dealer (not a member of the underwriting syndicate involved in the offering of the Fund), as agent for the Adviser, will\npurchase in the open market up to $20 million of our common shares in the aggregate, on such terms and at times, and subject to a variety of market and discount conditions and a daily purchase limit, to be described in a\nsubsequent press release. See “Management of the Fund — Related-Party Transactions” in the Fund’s prospectus. Whether purchases will be made under the 10b5-1 Plan and how much will be purchased at any time is\nuncertain, dependent on prevailing market prices and trading volumes, all of which we cannot predict. Although intended to provide liquidity, these activities may have the effect of maintaining the market price of our\ncommon shares or suppressing a decline in the market price of the common shares, and, as a result, the price of our common shares may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. Conversely,\nany eventual sale of purchased common shares by the Adviser and its affiliates may act as a catalyst for a decline in the Fund’s market price, and therefore the market price of our common shares may be lower than the\nprice that might otherwise exist in the open market. Limited Term Risk. Unless the Termination Date is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, the Fund will be terminated on the 15th\nanniversary of its effective date, currently expected to be March 26, 2030. If the Fund’s Board of Trustees believes that under then current market conditions it is in the best interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may\nextend the Termination Date for one year, which is anticipated to be March 26, 2031, without a shareholder vote, upon the affirmative vote of three-quarters of the Trustees then in office. Beginning one year before the\nTermination Date (the “wind-down period”), the Fund may begin liquidating all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio. During the wind-down period the Fund may deviate from its investment strategy. As a result, during the\nwind-down period the Fund’s distributions may decrease, and such distributions may include a return of capital.\nCHW and CGO: The Fund may invest up to 100% of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and market cap sizes, each of which has a unique risk profile. As a result of political or economic\ninstability in foreign countries, there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities. These include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased price volatility, and difficulty obtaining information.\nThe Fund may invest in derivative securities, including options and swap agreements. The use of derivatives presents risks different from, and possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in traditional\nsecurities. There is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the Fund will succeed. One of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised.\n4\n18841 1124M R\nAdditional Information: Fund Risks and Definitions (continued)\nCPZ: Equity Securities Risk. Equity investments are subject to greater fluctuations in market value than other asset classes as a result of such factors as the issuer’s business performance, investor perceptions, stock\nmarket trends and general economic conditions. Equity securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and liquidation\npayments. The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and convertible securities of any rating, including below investment grade. Short Selling Risk. The Fund will engage in short sales for investment and risk management\npurposes, including when the Adviser believes an investment will underperform due to a greater sensitivity to earnings growth of the issuer, default risk or interest rates. In times of unusual or adverse market,\neconomic, regulatory or political conditions, the Fund may not be able, fully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy. Periods of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions may\nexist for extended periods of time. Short sales are transactions in which the Fund sells a security or other instrument that it does not own but can borrow in the market. Short selling allows the Fund to profit from a\ndecline in market price to the extent such decline exceeds the transaction costs and the costs of borrowing the securities and to obtain a low cost means of financing long investments that the Adviser believes are\nattractive. If a security sold short increases in price, the Fund may have to cover its short position at a higher price than the short sale price, resulting in a loss. The Fund will have substantial short positions and must\nborrow those securities to make delivery to the buyer under the short sale transaction. The Fund may not be able to borrow a security that it needs to deliver, or it may not be able to close out a short position at an\nacceptable price and may have to sell related long positions earlier than it had expected. Thus, the Fund may not be able to successfully implement its short sale strategy due to limited availability of desired securities or\nfor other reasons. Limited Term Risk. Unless the limited term provision of the Fund’s Declaration of Trust is amended by shareholders in accordance with the Declaration of Trust, or unless the Fund completes the\nEligible Tender Offer and converts to perpetual existence, the Fund will dissolve on the Dissolution Date. The Fund is not a so called “target date” or “life cycle” fund whose asset allocation becomes more conservative\nover time as its target date, often associated with retirement, approaches. In addition, the Fund is not a “target term” fund whose investment objective is to return its original NAV on the Dissolution Date. The Fund’s\ninvestment objective and policies are not designed to seek to return to investors that purchase Shares in this offering their initial investment of $20.00 per Share on the Dissolution Date or in the Eligible Tender Offer,\nand such investors and investors that purchase Shares after the completion of this offering may receive more or less than their original investment upon dissolution or in the Eligible Tender Offer Terms.\nLeverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares; and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage\nfinancing. The ratio is the percent of borrowing to total assets.\nCalamos Advisors LLC\nCalamos Financial Services LLC, Distributor\n2020 Calamos Court | Naperville, IL 60563-2787\n866.363.9219 | www.calamos.com | caminfo@calamos.com\n© 2024 Calamos Investments LLC.

CALAMOS, SR.\nFounder, Chairman, A new report format developed to help you with your asset\nand Global Chief\nInvestment Officer allocation decisions\nEach CalamosClosed-EndFund is designed to serve income-oriented investors by\nproviding steady, competitive distributions through a multi-asset, risk-managed,\nand flexible approach. Since we launched our first closed-end fund in 2002, we\nhave selectively expanded our offerings to provide investors with access to the\nincome and return opportunities of an evolving global economy.\nToday, our closed-end suite includes seven offerings, including enhanced fixed\nincome and total return funds, focused on either the US or global markets. (Please\nsee page 5 for an overview of the funds.) Whereas we previously provided an\nindividual report for each of our funds, this consolidated report now includes\ninformation about all of them. We hope you will welcome this format as an\nopportunity to learn more about the different ways we can help you pursue your\nincome and total return goals.\nInnovative multi-asset approaches designed to provide steady,\nattractive income\nFor investors seeking income, we understand the importance of providing a\npredictable amount of cash from month to month. Each of our closed-end funds\nis managed with the goal of providing steady (although not assured) monthly\ndistributions through managed rate or level rate distribution policies. As the chart\nbelow shows, as of the end of the reporting period, the funds each offered\nattractive annualized distribution rates versus the yields of market benchmarks.\nWe believe this speaks to the potential benefits of each fund’s multi-asset class\napproach.\nwww.calamos.com 1\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: john_calamos_new_photo.eps V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ba | Sequence: 2\nCHKSUM Content: 64570 Layout: 23563 Graphics: 60613 CLEAN\nLetter to Shareholders\nDelivering Competitive Distributions in a Challenging Environment\nCurrent annualized distribution rate (funds) versus yields of market benchmarks as of October 31, 2023\n%\n1\n15%\n9.59%\n11.04% 11.40% 11.49% 11.78% 12.24% 13.7\n9.48%\n10%\n5%\n5.65% 5.42%\n4.88%\n4.35%\n2.15% 1.68%\n0%\nCSQ CHY CHI CH W CGO CPZ CC UD S High Yi Uel S Id nvst B- oG nr da sde Short- BT oe nr 1dsm 0 Year Treas Glo Gb ral a I dn e v Bst o- n Ud S Convert Stocks\nPerformance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.Current performance may be lower\nor higher than the performance quoted. The principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when sold, may be\nworth more or less than their original cost. You can purchase or sell common shares daily. Like any other stock, the market price will\nfluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net asset value and may be worth\nmore or less than your original investment.\nPerspectives on premiums and discounts\nI’m often asked about my thoughts on premiums and discounts—specifically, whether investors should\nbe concerned if their fund is trading at a discount to net asset value. Over time, it’s quite normal for\na closed-end fund to trade at a discount. At Calamos, our teams have a saying, “the flipside of volatility\nis opportunity.” In other words, we recognize that short-term selloffs provide excellent occasions to\nadd favorite positions at a lower cost. Similarly, I believe that for long-term fund investors, when a\nCalamos closed-end fund trades at a discount, it could be an attractive buying opportunity.\nMarket review\nThe reporting period was remarkable for its many ups anddowns. Market turmoil reflected uncertainty\nabout interest rates and Federal Reserve policy, energy prices, and inflation.

The yield of the US 10-Year Treasury Bond reached multi-decade highs, while\nthe onset of the Israel-Hamaswar intensified geopolitical uncertainty.\nOutlook\nWe see many signs pointing to slower economic growth and increasing risks across sectors. Higher\ninterest rates will take time to work through the economy, with far-reaching consequences for\nbusinesses and consumers. Global manufacturing data is trending down, and fuel prices are putting\nsignificant pressure on many companies and households. Meanwhile, retailers will likely struggle as\nconsumer nest eggs amassed during the pandemic dwindle and student loan repayments resume.Fiscal\npolicy uncertainty, already elevated, will intensify as the US presidential election approaches. We expect\ngeopolitical crosscurrents will take a toll on individual markets, sectors and industries. Monetary policy\nwill also remain a focal point for the markets as investors contemplate the Federal Reserve’s next moves.\nAgainst this backdrop, we expect saw-toothed and volatile markets to continue.\nAsset allocation considerations\nWhen global financial markets are as turbulent as they have been over recent months, investors may\nbe tempted to retreat to the sidelines or give into short-term thinking. Income-oriented investors have\nfaced added uncertainties as rates have risen. However, as we’ve noted in the past, jumping in and out\nof the market is a dangerous strategy—investors tend to capture the downturns and miss the upturns.\nInstead, establishing an asset allocation that aligns with your needs and risk tolerance is a far better\ncourse. Our teams are unwavering in their commitment to you and remain dedicated to seeking\ncompetitive distributions while paying close attention to the market risks.\nWe believe ourfunds, which have multiple levers for pursuing income and total returns, will be better\npositioned than those with more limited tools at their disposal. For example, we have the flexibility to\ninvest across fixed income markets. Our bond holdings, such as high yield bonds and convertible\nbonds, have typically been less susceptible to interest rate changes than longer-duration investment-\ngrade corporate or municipal bonds. Additionally, we believe the funds’ judicious use of leverage can\ncontinue to provide long-term benefits to shareholders, despite the more recent headwinds of higher\ninterest rates.\nIn the commentaries that follow, you’ll read about the many ways our teams are pursuing competitive\ndistributions and returns while seeking to manage the risks in the current environment.In addition to\nlearning more about your current funds, I invite you to learn more about our other offerings as well.\nAs always, thank you for your continued trust.

The rate from July1, 2023, through October31, 2023,wascharged at OBFR\nplus 2.52%. These rates represent floating rates of interest that may change over time. The SSB\nAgreement has a commitment fee of 0.10% of any undrawn amount.\nAs of October31, 2023, the interest rate charged under the SSB Agreement was 5.84%.\nThe Fund’s MRP Shareholders are entitled to receive monthly cash dividends, at a currently effective\ndividend rate per annum for each series of MRP Shares as follows (subject to adjustment as described\nin the Fund’s prospectus): 4.00% for Series B MRP Shares, 4.24% for Series C MRP Shares, 2.45% for\nSeries D MRP Shares and 3.66% for Series F MRP Shares.

The purpose of this table is\nto assist you in understanding the effects of leverage. As the table shows, leverage generally increases\nthe return to common shareholders when portfolio return is positive and greater than the cost of\nleverage and decreases the return when the portfolio return is negative or less than the cost of leverage.\nThe figures appearing in the table are hypothetical and actual returns may be greater or less than those\nappearing in the table.\nAssumed Portfolio Return (Net of Expenses) (10.00)% (5.00)% 0.00% 5.00% 10.00%\nCorresponding Common Share Return(1) (17.93)% (10.33)% (2.73)% 4.87% 12.47%\n(1) Includes interest expense on the borrowings under the SSB Agreement, accrued at interest rates in effect on October31, 2023\nof5.84%, and dividend expense on the MRP Shares.\nMarket and Net Asset Value Information\nOur common shares have traded both at a premium and a discount to NAV. We cannot predict whether\nour shares will trade in the future at a premium or discount to NAV. The provisions of the 1940 Act\ngenerally require that the public offering price of common shares (less any underwriting commissions\nand discounts) must equal or exceed the NAV per share of a company’s common stock (calculated\nwithin 48 hours of pricing). Our issuance of common shares may have an adverse effect on prices in\nthe secondary market for our common shares by increasing the number of common shares available,\nwhich may put downward pressure on the market price for our common shares. Shares of common\nstock of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from NAV.\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated the high and low closing market prices\nfor our common shares on Nasdaq, the NAV per share and the premium or discount to NAV per share\nat which our common shares were trading.

The rate from July 1, 2023, through\nOctober 31, 2023, was OBFR plus 0.52%. Interest on overdue amounts or interest on the drawn\namount paid during an event of default was charged OBFR plus 2.80% from November 1, 2022,\nthrough June30, 2023. The rate from July1, 2023, through October31, 2023,wascharged at OBFR\nplus 2.52%. These rates represent floating rates of interest that may change over time. The SSB\nAgreement has a commitment fee of 0.10% of any undrawn amount.\nAs of October31, 2023, the interest rate charged under the SSB Agreement was 5.84%.\nThe Fund’s MRP Shareholders are entitled to receive monthly cash dividends, at a currently effective\ndividend rate per annum for each series of MRP Shares as follows (subject to adjustment as described\nin the Fund’s prospectus): 4.00% for Series B MRP Shares, 4.24% for Series C MRP Shares, 2.45% for\nSeries D MRP Shares, and 2.68% for Series E MRP Shares.\nTo cover the interest expense on the borrowings under the SSB Agreement (including “net income”\npayments made with respect to borrowings offset by collateral for securities on loan) and the dividend\npayments associated with the MRP Shares, based on rates in effect on October 31, 2023, the Fund’s\nportfolio would need to experience an annual return of 2.03% (before giving effect to expenses\nassociated with senior securities).\nThe following table illustrates the hypothetical effect on the return to a holder of the Fund’s common\nshares of the leverage obtained by us (and utilized on October31, 2023). The purpose of this table is\nto assist you in understanding the effects of leverage. As the table shows, leverage generally increases\nthe return to common shareholders when portfolio return is positive and greater than the cost of\nleverage and decreases the return when the portfolio return is negative or less than the cost of leverage.\nThe figures appearing in the table are hypothetical and actual returns may be greater or less than those\nappearing in the table.\nAssumed Portfolio Return (Net of Expenses) (10.00)% (5.00)% 0.00% 5.00% 10.00%\nCorresponding Common Share Return(1) (19.97)% (11.67)% (3.37)% 4.93% 13.23%\n(1) Includes interest expense on the borrowings under the SSB Agreement, accrued at interest rates in effect on October31, 2023\nof5.84%, and dividend expense on the MRP Shares.\nMarket and Net Asset Value Information\nOur common shares have traded both at a premium and a discount to NAV. We cannot predict whether\nour shares will trade in the future at a premium or discount to NAV. The provisions of the 1940 Act\ngenerally require that the public offering price of common shares (less any underwriting commissions\nand discounts) must equal or exceed the NAV per share of a company’s common stock (calculated\nwithin 48 hours of pricing). Our issuance of common shares may have an adverse effect on prices in\nthe secondary market for our common shares by increasing the number of common shares available,\nwhich may put downward pressure on the market price for our common shares. Shares of common\nstock of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from NAV.\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated the high and low closing market prices\nfor our common shares on Nasdaq, the NAV per share and the premium or discount to NAV per share\nat which our common shares were trading.

Our issuance of common shares may have an adverse effect on prices in\nthe secondary market for our common shares by increasing the number of common shares available,\nwhich may put downward pressure on the market price for our common shares.

As the table shows, leverage generally increases\nthe return to common shareholders when portfolio return is positive and greater than the cost of\nleverage and decreases the return when the portfolio return is negative or less than the cost of leverage.\nThe figures appearing in the table are hypothetical and actual returns may be greater or less than those\nappearing in the table.\nAssumed Portfolio Return (Net of Expenses) (10.00)% (5.00)% 0.00% 5.00% 10.00%\nCorresponding Common Share Return(1) (17.94)% (10.29)% (2.64)% 5.01% 12.66%\n(1) Includes interest expense on the borrowings under the SSB Agreement, accrued at interest rates in effect on October31, 2023\nof5.84%, and dividend expense on the MRP Shares.\nMarket and Net Asset Value Information\nOur common shares have traded both at a premium and a discount to NAV. We cannot predict whether\nour shares will trade in the future at a premium or discount to NAV. The provisions of the 1940 Act\ngenerally require that the public offering price of common shares (less any underwriting commissions\nand discounts) must equal or exceed the NAV per share of a company’s common stock (calculated\nwithin 48 hours of pricing). Our issuance of common shares may have an adverse effect on prices in\nthe secondary market for our common shares by increasing the number of common shares available,\nwhich may put downward pressure on the market price for our common shares. Shares of common\nstock of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from NAV.\nThe following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated the high and low closing market prices\nfor our common shares on Nasdaq, the NAV per share and the premium or discount to NAV per share\nat which our common shares were trading.

At the end of the annual\nperiod, the Fund’s monthly distribution rate was $0.0950 per share, and the\nannualized distribution rate on the Fund’s market price was 11.40%.\nWe believe both the Fund’s distribution rate and level remained attractive and\ncompetitive, given that yield opportunities are limited in much of the marketplace,\ndespite recent Fed tightening. As of October 31, 2023, the dividend yield of\nS&P 500 Index stocks averaged 1.68%. Although higher than a year ago, yields\nwithin the US government bond market were relatively low, with the 10-year US\nTreasury yielding4.88%.\nWhat factors influenced performance over the annual period?\nOn an unleveraged basis, our convertible bond holdings performed in line with\nthe ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index. Holdings in the information technology\nand industrials sectors were helpful to performance, whereas holdings in financials\nand energy were not.\nDuring the annual period, investors focused on the Federal Reserve’s response to\npersistent inflation and the potential for a recession. Geopolitical concerns,\nregional bank stress, rising fuel prices, and potential impacts of the United Auto\nWorkers strike also made headlines and induced volatility. Despite these\nheadwinds, the equity market began to recover from 2022’s lows, and the\nS&P500 Index returned 10.14% over the period. However, the higher-for-longer\ninterest rate environment stoked volatility in the bond market, and the Bloomberg\nUS Aggregate Bond Index rose just 0.36%.\nThe convertible market is well represented by small and mid-sized growth issuers,\nwhich lagged the broader equity market as evidenced by the Russell 2500 Growth\nIndex’s -4.80% return. More than half of the convertible market was priced below\npar on average during the reporting period, and convertibles (-0.48%) held up\nmuch better than their underlying stocks (-8.2%).\n42 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: ~note-color 2, Black GRAPHICS: 28873-8_Conv_Opp_Inc_L.eps, 28873-8_Conv_Opp_P.eps V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ca | Sequence: 3\nCHKSUM Content: 17184 Layout: 41294 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund\n(Unaudited)\nOur high-yield bond holdings slightly underperformed relative to the Bloomberg\nUS High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index.

Despite the perceived stability,\nthe trading range for spreads during the period was 150 basis points wide,\nreflecting the volatility across markets.

After increasing for most of the year, trailing 12-month defaults\ncame in at 2.6% on a par-weighted basis. We expect this measure to climb and\nclose the 2023 calendar year near the 3.0% average of the post-GFC era.

We also see opportunities in\nthe bond-like segment of the convertible market in issues that can benefit from\nspread compression while offering attractive yields and sound structural risk\nmitigation during equity market weakness. Within this segment of the convertible\nmarket, most issuers retain substantial cash balances along with minimal near-\nterm refinancing risk.

As of October 31, 2023, the average\nduration was 2.6 years.\nFrom a sector standpoint, the portfolio’s largest absolute weights are in\ninformation technology and consumer discretionary, while the smallest sector\nweights with holdings are in real estate and consumer staples. We maintain\nrelative overweight positions in health care and information technology, with\nhealth care equipment (in health care) and semiconductors (in information\ntechnology) among the overweight industries. The largest industry underweight\npositions are asset management & custody banks (in financials) and\ncommunications equipment (in information technology).\nAllocations to financials and consumer discretionary rose during the period, with\nincreased weights in transaction & payment processing services and broadline\nretail. The information technology allocation decreased during the period with a\nreduction in semiconductors, while the weight to utilities also decreased modestly,\nwith a paring back of independent power producers and energy traders.\nWe continue to hold our largest rated-bond allocations in the BB tier. We believe\nthis exposure offers investors a better risk/reward dynamic while providing regular\nincome. The average credit quality of the portfolio of rated bonds (BB) is higher\nthan that of the ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index. This is typical for the Fund\nbecause our credit process tends to guide us away from the most speculative\ncorporate securities. That said, we do selectively invest in lower-credit securities\nwhen we believe the risk/reward dynamics favor investors. We continue to find\nvalue in out-of-benchmark positions in leveraged loans and investment-grade\ncredit.\nAlthough the Fund tends to be US-centric because of the compelling risk/reward\nof investments, we are investing in global businesses that seek the best\nopportunities worldwide and diversify their revenue streams.

The average term to maturity of the Fund’s securities typically\nwill range from two to ten years. “Managed assets” means the Fund’s total assets (including any assets attributable to any\nleverage that may be outstanding) minus total liabilities (other than debt representing financial leverage).\nThe Fund is not limited in the percentage of its assets invested in convertible securities, and investment in convertible securities\nforms an important part of the Fund’s principal investment strategies.\nA convertible security is a debt security, debenture, note or preferred stock that is exchangeable for an equity security (typically\ncommon stock of the same issuer) at a predetermined price (the “conversion price”). Depending upon the relationship of\nthe conversion price to the market value of the underlying security, a convertible security may trade more like an equity\nsecurity than a debt instrument. The Fund may invest in convertible securities of any rating.\nThe Fund may invest in “synthetic” convertible instruments. A synthetic convertible instrument is a financial instrument (or two\nor more securities held in tandem) that is designed to simulate the economic characteristics of another instrument (i.e., a\nconvertible security) through the combined economic features of a collection of other securities or assets. Calamos may create\na synthetic convertible instrument by combining separate securities that possess the two principal characteristics of a true\nconvertible security, i.e., a fixed-income security (“fixed-income component”, which may be a convertible or non-convertible\nsecurity) and the right to acquire an equity security (“convertible component”). The fixed-income component is achieved by\ninvesting in fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred stocks and money market instruments. The convertible component\nis achieved by investing in warrants or options to buy common stock at a certain exercise price, or options on a stock index.The\nfixed income and convertible components may have different issuers, and either component may change at any time.\nThe Fund may also invest in synthetic convertible instruments created by third parties, typically investment banks. Synthetic\nconvertible instruments created by such parties may be designed to simulate the characteristics of traditional convertible\nsecurities or may be designed to alter or emphasize a particular feature. Synthetic convertible instruments may include\nstructured notes, equity-linked notes, mandatory convertibles and combinations of securities and instruments, such as a\ndebt instrument combined with a forward contract. The Fund’s holdings of synthetic convertible instruments are considered\nconvertible securities for purposes of the Fund’s policy to invest at least 35% of its managed assets in convertible securities\nand 80% of its managed assets in a diversified portfolio of convertible securities and non-convertible income securities.\nThe Fund will also invest in non-convertible income securities. The Fund’s investments in non-convertible income securities\nmay have fixed or variable principal payments and all types of interest rate and dividend payment and reset terms, including\nfixed rate, adjustable rate, zero coupon, contingent, deferred, payment in kind and auction rate features.\nA substantial portion of the Fund’s assets may be invested in below investment grade (high yield, high risk) securities for\neither current income or capital appreciation or both. These securities are rated Ba or lower by Moody’s Investors Service,\nInc. or BB or lower by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. or are\nunrated securities of comparable quality as determined by Calamos, the Fund’s investment adviser. The Fund may invest in\nhigh yield securities of any rating. The Fund may, but currently does not intend to, invest up to 5% of its managed assets in\ndistressed securities that are in default or the issuers of which are in bankruptcy.\n* This is a non-fundamental policy and may be changed by the Board of Trustees of the Fund provided that shareholders are provided with at least 60days’\nprior written notice of any change as required by the rules under the 1940 Act.\n46 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ca | Sequence: 7\nCHKSUM Content: 2509 Layout: 10090 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund (CHI)\n(Unaudited)\nAlthough the Fund primarily invests in securities of US issuers, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in securities\nof foreign issuers in developed and emerging markets, including debt and equity securities of corporate issuers and debt\nsecurities of government issuers.\nThe Fund may seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options.

Under the supervision and oversight of the Fund’s Board of Trustees, Calamos will determine whether\nRule144A Securities are liquid. Typically, the Fund purchases Rule144A Securities only if Calamos has determined them to\nbe liquid.\nThe Fund may invest in loan participations and other direct claims against a borrower. The corporate loans in which the Fund\nmay invest primarily consist of direct obligations of a borrower and may include debtor in possession financings pursuant to\nChapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, obligations of a borrower issued in connection with a restructuring pursuant to\nChapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, leveraged buy-out loans, leveraged recapitalization loans, receivables purchase\nfacilities, and privately placed notes. The Fund may invest in a corporate loan at origination as a co-lender or by acquiring in\nthe secondary market participations in, assignments of or novations of a corporate loan. Many such loans are secured,\nalthough some may be unsecured. Such loans may be in default at the time of purchase. In addition, loan participations\ninvolve a risk of insolvency of the lending bank or other financial intermediary. The markets in such loans are not regulated\nby federal securities laws or the Commission.\nThe Fund may invest in other securities of various types to the extent consistent with its investment objective. Normally, the\nFund invests substantially all of its assets to meet its investment objective. For temporary defensive purposes, the Fund may\ndepart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in securities with remaining maturities of less\nthan one year or cash equivalents; or it may hold cash. During such periods, the Fund may not be able to achieve its\ninvestment objective. There are no restrictions as to the ratings of debt securities acquired by the Fund or the portion of the\nFund’s assets that may be invested in debt securities in a particular ratings category.\nThe Fund currently uses, and may in the future use, financial leverage.

At the end of the\nperiod, the Fund’s monthly distribution rate was $0.1000 per share, and the\nannualized distribution rate on the Fund’s market price was 11.04%.\nWe believe the Fund’s distribution rate and level remained attractive and\ncompetitive despite rising yields in financial assets. For example, as of October31,\n2023, the dividend yield of S&P 500 Index stocks averaged 1.68%. Yields were\nalso relatively low within the US government bond market, with the 10-year US\nTreasury yielding4.88%.\nWhat factors influenced performance over the annual period?\nOn an unleveraged basis, our convertible bond holdings performed in line with\nthe ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index. Holdings in the information technology\nand industrials sectors were helpful to performance, whereas our holdings in\nfinancials and energy were not.\nDuring the annual period, investors focused on the Federal Reserve’s response to\npersistent inflation and the potential for a recession. Geopolitical concerns,\nregional bank stress, rising fuel prices, and potential impacts of the United Auto\nWorkers strike also made headlines and induced volatility. Despite these\nheadwinds, the equity market began to recover from 2022’s lows, and the\nS&P500 Index returned 10.14% over the period. However, the higher-for-longer\ninterest rate environment stoked volatility in the bond market, and the Bloomberg\nUS Aggregate Bond Index rose just 0.36%.\nThe convertible market is well represented by small and mid-sized growth issuers,\nwhich lagged the broader equity market as evidenced by the Russell 2500 Growth\nIndex’s -4.80% return. More than half of the convertible market was priced below\npar on average during the reporting period, and convertibles (-0.48%) held up\nmuch better than their underlying stocks (-8.2%).\nwww.calamos.com 49\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: ~note-color 2, Black GRAPHICS: 28873-8_High_Inc_P.eps, 28873-8_Conv_High_Inc_L.eps V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ca | Sequence: 10\nCHKSUM Content: 27108 Layout: 36305 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Convertible and High Income Fund\n(Unaudited)\nOur high-yield bond holdings slightly underperformed relative to the Bloomberg\nUS High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index. Our selection in the energy and financials\nsectors contributed to results, while our selection in the communication services\nand consumer discretionary sectors trailed.\nHigh-yield spreads were modestly tighter, closing at 437 basis points on an option-\nadjusted basis, down from 464 in the prior year. Despite the perceived stability,\nthe trading range for spreads during the period was 150 basis points wide,\nreflecting the volatility across markets. Lower quality outperformed as CCCs\nreturned 7.4%, B-rated paper returned 6.8%, and more rate-sensitive BBs\nreturned 5.3%. After increasing for most of the year, trailing 12-month defaults\ncame in at 2.6% on a par-weighted basis. We expect this measure to climb and\nclose the 2023 calendar year near the 3.0% average of the post-GFC era. The\nbest-performing sectors in the Bloomberg US High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index\nwere finance companies (+10.9%), consumer cyclicals (+10.2%), and brokers and\nasset managers (+3.5), whereas communications (+0.8%), electric utilities\n(+3.1%), and transportation (+3.3%) represented the laggards.\nOther factors that contributed and detracted from Fund performance included\nthe following:\nn On an unleveraged basis, the portfolio underperformed the comparator index.\nOur relative overweight in convertibles and underweight in corporate bonds\nrelative to the index hindered performance.\nn Our use of put options was beneficial relative to the comparator index.\nn Our selection of corporate bonds was not helpful to returns.\nn The Fund benefited from leading security selection and an average overweight\nstance in information technology, specifically in the data processing &\noutsourced services and the communications equipment industries.\nn Security selection and an average underweight stance in industrials contributed\nto performance, specifically in the electrical components& equipment and the\nindustrial machinery& supplies& components industries.\nn Conversely, security selection and an average underweight stance within the\nconsumer discretionary sector weakened return over the period. In particular,\npositions in the hotels, resorts & cruise lines industry and automobile\nmanufacturers lagged.\nn Security selection and an average underweight stance in energy lost ground on\na relative basis, specifically in the oil& gas drilling and the oil& gas exploration&\nproduction industries.\nHow is the Fund positioned?\nAs of October31, 2023, approximately 66% of our portfolio as a percent of net\nassets was invested in convertible securities.

Balanced convertibles provide a favorable\nasymmetric payoff profile by offering an attractive level of upside equity\nparticipation with less exposure to downside moves. We also see opportunities in\nthe bond-like segment of the convertible market in issues that can benefit from\nspread compression while offering attractive yields and sound structural risk\nmitigation during equity market weakness. Within this segment of the convertible\nmarket, most issuers retain substantial cash balances along with minimal near-\nterm refinancing risk.

We have been gradually increasing\nportfolio durations in expectation of peak-Fed policy rates and a greater likelihood\nthat the next rate move will be a cut. As of October 31, 2023, the average\nduration was 2.6 years.\nFrom a sector standpoint, the portfolio’s largest absolute weights are in\ninformation technology and health care, while the smallest sector weights with\nholdings are in real estate and consumer staples. We maintain relative overweight\npositions in health care and information technology, with health care equipment\n(in health care) and semiconductors (in information technology) among the\noverweight industries. The largest industry underweight positions are asset\nmanagement& custody banks and communications equipment.\nAllocations to financials and consumer discretionary rose during the period, with\nincreased weights in transaction & payment processing services and broadline\nretail. The information technology allocation decreased during the period, with a\nreduction in semiconductors, while the weight to utilities also decreased modestly,\nwith a paring back in independent power producers and energy traders.\nWe continue to hold our largest rated bond allocations in the BB tier. We believe\nthis exposure offers investors a better risk/reward dynamic while providing regular\nincome. The average (BB) credit quality of the portfolio’s bonds is higher than that\nof the ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index. This higher relative credit is typical for\nthe Fund because our process tends to guide us away from the most speculative\ncorporate securities.

The average term\nto maturity of the Fund’s securities typically will range from two to ten years.\n“Managed assets” means the Fund’s total assets (including any assets attributable\nto any leverage that may be outstanding) minus total liabilities (other than debt\nrepresenting financial leverage).\nThe Fund’s derivative activities are principally focused on the following derivatives:\ninterest rate swaps, convertible securities, synthetic convertible instruments,\noptions on individual securities, index options and forward currency exchange\ncontracts. However, the Fund reserves the right to invest in other derivative\ninstruments to the extent it is consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and\nrestrictions.\nInvestment in convertible securities forms an important part of the Fund’s principal\ninvestment strategies. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest\natleast20% of its managed assets in convertible securities. A convertible security\nis a debt security, debenture, note or preferred stock that is exchangeable for an\nequity security (typically common stock of the same issuer) at a predetermined\nprice (the “conversion price”). Depending upon the relationship of the conversion\nprice to the market value of the underlying security, a convertible security may\ntrade more like an equity security than a debt instrument. The Fund may invest in\nconvertible securities of any rating.\nThe Fund may invest in “synthetic” convertible instruments. A synthetic\nconvertible instrument is a financial instrument (or two or more securities held in\ntandem) that is designed to simulate the economic characteristics of another\ninstrument (i.e., a convertible security) through the combined economic features\nof a collection of other securities or assets. Calamos may create a synthetic\nconvertible instrument by combining separate securities that possess the two\nprincipal characteristics of a true convertible security, i.e., a fixed-income security\n(“fixed-income component”, which may be a convertible or non-convertible\nsecurity) and the right to acquire an equity security (“convertible component”).\nThe fixed-income component is achieved by investing in fixed-income securities\nsuch as bonds, preferred stocks and money market instruments.

Synthetic convertible instruments created by\nsuch parties may be designed to simulate the characteristics of traditional\nconvertible securities or may be designed to alter or emphasize a particular\nfeature. Synthetic convertible instruments may include structured notes, equity-\nlinked notes, mandatory convertibles and combinations of securities and\ninstruments, such as a debt instrument combined with a forward contract. The\nFund’s holdings of synthetic convertible instruments are considered convertible\nsecurities for purposes of the Fund’s policy to invest at least 20% of its managed\nassets in convertible securities and 80% of its managed assets in a diversified\nportfolio of convertible securities and below investment grade (high yield/high\nrisk) non-convertible debt securities.\nInvestment in high yield securities forms an important part of the Fund’s principal\ninvestment strategies. The Fund will invest in high yield securities for either current\nincome or capital appreciation or both. Under normal circumstances, the Fund\nwill invest at least 20% of its managed assets in high yield non-convertible debt\nsecurities. These securities are rated Ba or lower by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\n(“Moody’s”) or BB or lower by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, a\nsubsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“Standard & Poor’s”) or are\nunrated securities of comparable quality as determined by Calamos, the Fund’s\ninvestment adviser. The Fund may invest in high yield securities of any rating. The\nFund may, but currently does not intend to, invest up to 5% of its managed assets\nin distressed securities that are in default or the issuers of which are in bankruptcy.\nAlthough the Fund primarily invests in securities of US issuers, the Fund may invest\nup to 25% of its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers in developed and\nemerging markets, including debt and equity securities of corporate issuers and\ndebt securities of government issuers. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its\nmanaged assets in securities of foreign issuers in emerging markets.\nThe Fund may invest without limit in certain securities (“Rule 144A Securities”),\nsuch as convertible and debt securities, that are typically purchased in transactions\nexempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act pursuant to Rule144A\nunder that Act. Under the supervision and oversight of the Fund’s Board of\nTrustees, Calamos will determine whether Rule144A Securities are liquid. Typically,\nthe Fund purchases Rule144A Securities only if Calamos has determined them to\nbe liquid.\nThe Fund may invest in loan participations and other direct claims against a\nborrower. The corporate loans in which the Fund may invest primarily consist of\ndirect obligations of a borrower and may include debtor in possession financings\npursuant to Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, obligations of a borrower\nissued in connection with a restructuring pursuant to Chapter 11 of the US\nBankruptcy Code, leveraged buy-out loans, leveraged recapitalization loans,\nreceivables purchase facilities, and privately placed notes.

Convertible\nsecurities are excluded from this limitation. MLPs are investment vehicles generally\norganized under state law as limited partnerships or limited liability companies.\nMLPs typically issue general partner and limited partner interests, or managing\nmember and member interests, and MLP-issued securities are often listed and\ntraded on a securities exchange. Such securities are structured by contract and\nmay incorporate both equity-like and debt-like components. The general partner\nor manager of the MLP generally controls the operation and management of the\nMLP, and typically is eligible for certain incentive distributions under the terms of\nthe MLP. The Fund will not typically invest in general partner or manager interests\nof MLPs. Limited partner or member interests in MLPs may have either preferred\nor subordinated rights to MLP assets and distributions.\nThe Fund may invest in securities of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”),\nincluding debt securities they may issue. REITs primarily invest in income-producing\nreal estate or real estate related loans or interests. REITs are generally classified as\nequity REITs, mortgage REITs or a combination of equity and mortgage REITs.\nEquity REITs invest the majority of their assets directly in real property and derive\nincome primarily from the collection of rents. Equity REITs can also realize capital\ngains by selling properties that have appreciated in value.

The Fund’s monthly\ndistribution rate on October31, 2023, was $0.1025 per share, and its annualized\ndistribution rate based on market price was 9.59%.\nWe believe the Fund’s distribution rate and level remained attractive and\ncompetitive because yield opportunities are limited in much of the marketplace\ndespite recent Fed tightening. For example, as of October31, 2023, the dividend\nyield of S&P500 Index stocks was1.68%. Although higher than a year ago, yields\nwithin the US government bond market were relatively low, with the 10-year US\nTreasury yielding4.88%.\nWhat factors influenced performance over the annual period?\nEquity markets rallied over the course of the period, lifting off lows from the\nmarket sell-off that began in late 2021 when the Fed and central bankers around\nthe world began raising interest rates in an effort to tackle inflation. The Fed hiked\nthe fed funds rate in historically short order (300 basis points in approximately six\nmonths), and the broad market, not surprisingly, did not react favorably, falling\nby -24% from late December2021 through early October2022. At the onset of\nthis annual period, investors were pleased to see data suggesting that inflation\nhad likely peaked, which many believed would allow the Fed to slow down its\nfurious pace of interest rate hikes.\nCyclical stocks and beleaguered value stocks led the market in the initial months\nof the reporting period, but that leadership was short-lived as the Fed continued\nto promote a hawkish narrative. During these 12 months, the Fed would raise\nrates an additional 225 basis points. In March 2023, two of the largest bank\nfailures in history, Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse, sent investors flocking to\nthe large-cap growth stocks of companies with significant balance sheets and ties\nto AI (artificial intelligence). Toward the end of the period, investors continued to\ngrapple with questions of whether the Fed could induce a soft landing for the US\neconomy while reining in inflation or whether a recession would result from the\nsignificant change in the cost of capital. Geopolitical risks increased with the onset\nof conflict between Hamas and Israel in October2023. Those cumulative concerns\nweighed on the markets, with the S&P 500 Index, a measure of the US equity\nmarket, declining by -10% toward the end of the annualperiod.\n58 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: ~note-color 2, Black GRAPHICS: 28873-8_Strat_Total_L.eps, 28873-8_Strat_Total_P.eps V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ca | Sequence: 19\nCHKSUM Content: 930 Layout: 28802 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund\n(Unaudited)\nFor theannualperiod, the US equity market, as represented by the S&P500 Index,\ngained 10.14%, although it should be noted that an equal-weighted S&P 500\nIndex went nowhere on the year, with a total return of -0.75%. Small-cap stocks,\nrepresented by the Russell 2000 Index, dropped -8.57% for the annual period,\nand mid-cap stocks, as measured by the Russell Midcap Index, also struggled with\na -1.01% return. Mega-cap growth stocks performed best and carried the bulk\nof the overall S&P 500 Index’s return, particularly those tied to AI with solid\nbalance sheets (and perhaps less concerned about borrowing from banks or\nraising capital in a higher-interest-rate environment). The top eight names in the\nS&P 500 Index by market cap, representing approximately 26% of the index’s\nmarket cap, are primarily tech-related, stronger-balance-sheet companies,\naccounting for 85% of the market’s gain over the period.\nWithin the S&P 500 Index, communication services (+36%) and information\ntechnology (+31%) were significant outperformers led by mega-cap growth\nnames and were the only two sectors to beat the overall market. Consumer\ndiscretionary (+8%), industrials (+6%), and materials (+5%) delivered positive\nreturns, but all other sectors finished in negative territory for the reporting period.\nEnergy (-2%), financials (-3%), consumer staples (-3%), health care (-5%), real\nestate (-7%), and utilities (-8%) rounded out performance by sector.\nThe convertible market is well represented by small and mid-sized growth issuers,\nwhich lagged the broader equity market as evidenced by the Russell 2500 Growth\nIndex’s -4.80% return. More than half of the convertible market was priced below\npar on average during the reporting period, and convertibles (-0.48%) held up\nmuch better than their underlying stocks (-8.2%).\nHigh yield spreads were modestly tighter, closing at 437 basis points on an option-\nadjusted basis, down from 464 in the prior year. Despite the perceived stability,\nthe trading range for spreads during the period was 150 basis points wide,\nreflecting the volatility across markets. Lower quality outperformed as CCCs\nreturned 7.4%, B-rated paper returned 6.8%, and more rate-sensitive BBs\nreturned 5.3%.\nOther factors that contributed and detracted from Fund performance included\nthe following:\nn On an unleveraged basis, the portfolio slightly outperformed the comparator\nindex during the period.\nn Our overweight and selection in stocks relative to the comparator index were\nbeneficial to returns, as was our selection in convertible preferred stocks,\nn Our selection in convertible bonds detracted from returns, as did our selection\nin corporate bonds.\nThe Fund’s leading security selection in information technology positively\ncontributed to relative performance. In particular, positions in the semiconductors\nand the systems software industries assisted relative performance. Leading security\nselection and an average underweight allocation in communication services,\nspecifically in the interactive media & services and cable & satellite industries,\ncontributed to performance.\nOver the period, security selection and an average underweight stance within the\nconsumer discretionary sector weakened return. Specifically, positions in\nautomobile manufacturers and the hotels, resorts & cruise lines industry lagged.\nSecurity selection and an average overweight allocation in financials, specifically\nin diversified banks and multi-sector holdings, also lost ground on a relative basis.\nwww.calamos.com 59\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ca | Sequence: 20\nCHKSUM Content: 48903 Layout: 20681 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund\n(Unaudited)\nHow is the Fund positioned?\nAt the beginning of 2023, we outlined the case for increasing theFund’srisk by\nfocusing on selective areas of the economy that we believed should show\nimproving economic growth in 2023 and 2024, in addition to companies that\ncould improve returns on capital during that time. Our premise to selectively add\nrisk was based on several factors, including our convictions about the long-term\nUS economic growth trajectory, positive policy changes, and improvements in\ncertain parts of the economy, despite opposing forces slowing growth down in\nother economic sectors. In aggregate, the events of the first three quarters of\n2023 (the slowing of central bank rate increases, moderate slowing of inflation\nand economic growth, corporate cost-cutting measures, and accelerated spending\nin AI-related areas) have supported that risk profile. Risk-asset returns were positive\nduring this time, although there was a significant dispersion of returns across\nsectors and industries.\nWe believe the best positioning for this environment is a more neutral or defensive\nrisk posture, with risk in specific areas with real growth tailwinds, in companies\nwith improving returns on capital in 2024, and in equities and fixed income with\nvaluations at favorable expected risk-adjusted returns. We see compelling\nprospects for companies that have exposure to new products and geographic\ngrowth opportunities (in health care, electric vehicles, and AI-related infrastructure\nand software), specific infrastructure spending areas (in materials and industrials),\nand the normalization of supply chains and areas of the service economy.\nRegarding asset-class positioning, we maintain a relatively high allocation to\ncommon stocks and convertibles, whose combined exposure represents\napproximately 80% of the portfolio’s assets as of October31, 2023.\nWe focus on actively managing the risk/reward trade-offs within the portfolio.\nThe characteristics of convertible securities vary: some are more bond-like, some\nare more equity-like, and others offer balance. We have maintained a preference\nfor the balanced portion of the convertible market to take advantage of recent\nequity-valuation resets. Balanced convertibles provide a favorable asymmetric\npayoff profile by offering an attractive level of upside equity participation with\nless exposure to downside moves.\nWe are still favoring higher-credit-quality companies with improving free cash flow.\nWe selectively use options and convertible bonds to gain exposure to higher-risk\nindustries. From an asset-class perspective, cash and short-term Treasuries remain\nuseful tools for lowering volatility in a multi-asset-class portfolio, given their yields.\nThe portfolio’s average credit quality is BB+. This is typical for the Fund because\nour credit process tends to guide us away from the most speculative corporate\nsecurities. However, we recognize that opportunities exist among lower-credit\nsecurities to enhance performance.\nIn terms of economic sectors, the largest absolute allocations reside in information\ntechnology and consumer discretionary, whereas the smallest sector weight\nallocations with holdings are found in real estate and materials. On a relative basis,\nsystems software and technology hardware, storage& peripherals are among the\noverweight industries. Application software and biotechnology are among the\nunderweight industries.\nAllocations to information technology and communication services rose with\nincreased weights in systems software and interactive media& services. The health\ncare allocation decreased during the period, while the weight to consumer staples\nalso decreased modestly with a paring back in pharmaceuticals and soft drinks&\nnon-alcoholic beverages.\n60 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ca | Sequence: 21\nCHKSUM Content: 12043 Layout: 9750 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund\n(Unaudited)\nWe are also aware of the fact that rising interest rates may have a detrimental\neffect on longer-term fixed-income securities.

Calamos seeks to assess the value of an issuer’s total\nenterprise by studying its financial statements, including its balance sheet. Once enterprise value is determined, Calamos\nseeks to assess the value of the issuer’s different types of securities, taking into account the business risk of the issuer, its\ncompetitive position and the seniority of each type of security relative to the rest of the issuer’s capital structure. This approach\nserves as the basis for the Calamos research team’s design and use of proprietary models which, along with risk management\nand portfolio construction techniques, assist in determining whether a given security presents an investment opportunity for\nthe Fund.\nThe Fund may seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options. The Fund may write (sell) call\noptions (i)on a portion of the equity securities (including equity securities obtainable by the Fund through the exercise of its\nrights with respect to convertible securities it owns) in the Fund’s portfolio and (ii)on broad-based securities indices (such as\nthe Standard and Poor’s 500®Index (“S&P500”) or the MSCI EAFE®Index (“MSCI EAFE”), which is an index of international\nequity stocks) or certain ETFs (exchange traded funds) that trade like common stocks but seek to replicate such market\nindices.\nThe Fund currently uses, and may in the future use, financial leverage.

At the end of the\nperiod, the Fund’s monthly distribution rate was $0.1950 per share. On\nOctober 31, 2023, the annualized distribution rate on the Fund’s market price\nwas 13.71%.\nWe believe the Fund’s distribution rate and level remained attractive and\ncompetitive, given that yield opportunities are limited in much of the marketplace\ndespite recent Fed tightening. As of October 31, 2023, the dividend yield of\nS&P 500 Index stocks was 1.68%. Yields were also relatively low within the US\ngovernment bond market, with the 10-year US Treasury yielding4.88%.\nWhat factors influenced performance over the annual period?\nDuring the annual period, investors focused on the Federal Reserve’s response to\npersistent inflation and the potential for a recession. Geopolitical concerns,\nregional bank stress, rising fuel prices, and potential impacts of the United Auto\nWorkers strike also made headlines and induced volatility. Despite these\nheadwinds, the equity market began to recover from 2022’s lows, and the\nS&P 500 Index returned 10.14% over the period. The higher-for-longer interest\nrate environment continued to stoke volatility in the bond market, and the\nBloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index rose just 0.36%.\nThe convertible market is well represented by small and mid-sized growth issuers,\nwhich lagged the broader equity market as evidenced by the Russell 2500 Growth\nIndex’s -4.80% return. More than half of the convertible market was priced below\npar on average during the reporting period, and convertibles (-0.48%) held up\nmuch better than their underlying stocks (-8.2%).\nHigh-yield spreads were modestly tighter, closing at 437 basis points on an option-\nadjusted basis, down from 464 in the prior year. Despite the perceived stability,\nthe trading range for spreads during the period was 150 basis points wide,\nreflecting the volatility across markets.

Conversely, consumer staples and real\nestate represent the smallest absolute sector weights with holdings. On a relative\nbasis, the largest industry overweight positions are in health care equipment and\nleisure facilities. Significant industry underweight positions are in communications\nequipment and biotechnology.\nThe financials allocation increased during the period, while the weight to\nconsumer discretionary also rose modestly, with increased weights in transaction&\npayment processing services and home furnishing retail. The information\ntechnology allocation decreased during the period, with a reduction in\nsemiconductors, while the weight to energy also declined modestly, with a paring\nback in oil& gas exploration& production.\nThe average (BB+) credit quality of the rated securities in the portfolio is higher\nthan that of the ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index. This higher relative credit is\ntypical for the Fund because our process tends to guide us away from the most\nspeculative corporate securities while still providing regular income. That said, we\nselectively invest in lower-credit securities when we believe the risk/return\ndynamics favor our investors.\nAlthough the Fund tends to be US-centric because of the compelling risk/reward\nof investments, we invest in global businesses that can seek the best opportunities\nworldwide and diversify their revenue streams. Overall, we hold that our portfolio\ncompanies are performing well fundamentally, earning attractive cash flow\nmargins, improving their credit profiles, and utilizing reasonable debt levels to\nfund their operations.\nOver the longer term, we believe in the prudent use of leverage as a means to\nenhance total return and support the Fund’s distribution rate over time.

With regard\nto the synthetic convertible instruments, the fixed income and convertible components may have different issuers, and either\ncomponent may change at any time. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund’s managed assets will be invested\nin convertible securities and income-producing securities, with at least 50% of the Fund’s managed assets invested in\nconvertible securities (including synthetic convertibles).* The Fund may invest up to 50% of its managed assets in securities\nof foreign issuers, with up to 15% of its managed assets in securities issued by foreign issuers in emerging markets.\nThe Fund may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in high-yield non-convertible bonds (excluding such securities held to\ncreate synthetic convertible instruments). In addition, the Fund may invest all or substantially all of its managed assets in\nbelow investment grade convertible securities (including non-convertible securities held to create synthetic convertible\ninstruments); provided that, the Fund may invest up to 15% of its managed assets in convertible and non-convertible\nsecurities rated below B3 by Moody’s or below B- by Standard & Poor’s. As such, the Fund’s portfolio may at times consist\nentirely or primarily of below investment grade securities, including high-yield bonds. The Fund may invest up to 15% of its\nmanaged assets in illiquid securities. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its managed assets in the equity securities of REITs\nand up to 10% of its managed assets in the equity securities of MLPs; however, convertible securities are excluded from\neach of these limitations. The Fund may invest in securities with a broad range of maturities. “Managed assets” means the\nFund’s total assets (including any assets attributable to any leverage that may be outstanding) minus total liabilities (other\nthan debt representing financial leverage).\nThe Fund may seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options. The Fund may write (sell) call\noptions (i) on a portion of the equity securities (including securities that are convertible into equity securities) in the Fund’s\nportfolio, (ii)on a portion of a convertible security that it owns at the time it writes the call, and (iii)on broad-based securities\nindexes (such as the Standard and Poor’s 500®Index (“S&P500”) or the MSCI EAFE®Index (“MSCI EAFE”)) or certain ETFs\n(exchange traded funds) that trade like common stocks but seek to replicate such market indexes.\nThe Fund currently uses, and may in the future use, financial leverage. The Fund has obtained financial leverage (i)under an\nAmended and Restated Liquidity Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“SSB Agreement”) that allows the\nFund to borrow up to $370 million and (ii)through the issuance of four series of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares\n(“MRPS” or “MRP Shares”) with an aggregate liquidation preference of $92 million.\nTerm Structure\nAbsent shareholder approval to amend the limited term provision of the Fund’s Agreement and Declaration of Trust, the Fund’s\nAgreement and Declaration of Trust provides that it will cease to exist at the close of business on the fifteenth anniversary of\nthe effective date of the Fund’s registration statement, March26, 2030, except for the purpose of satisfying any existing debts\nor obligations, collecting and distributing its assets and doing all other acts required to liquidate and wind up its business and\naffairs.

Our\ninvestment team evaluates macroeconomic factors and growth opportunities and\nactively integrates them into the investment decision-making process. To tap into\nselective growth potential in the global economy, we favor quality growth\ncompanies with quality balance sheets, strong brands, free cash flows, and\nexperienced management—businesses poised to withstand market volatility.\nThe financials allocation increased during the period, and the weight to consumer\ndiscretionary also rose modestly, with increased weights in transaction& payment\nprocessing services and home furnishing retail. The allocations to information\ntechnology and energy decreased during the period, with reductions in the\nsemiconductor and the oil& gas exploration& production industries.\nIn terms of economic sectors, the largest allocations reside in information\ntechnology and consumer discretionary on an absolute basis, whereas the smallest\nsector allocations with holdings are found within utilities and real estate. We\nmaintain overweight allocations in the semiconductors and diversified banks\nindustries. The largest industry underweight positions are in application software\nand biotechnology.\nFrom a regional standpoint, the portfolio’s largest weights are in the United States\nand Emerging Asia, while the smallest absolute weights are in EMEA and\nEmerging Latin America. We maintain relative overweight positions in Emerging\nAsia and Europe, while the portfolio is underweight in the United States and Japan\ncompared to the index. Overall, we maintained relatively stable weights.\nThe portfolio’s average credit quality is BB+.

The Fund may also use other income-producing strategies, including options, swaps and other derivative\ninstruments, for both investment and hedging purposes. The Fund, under normal circumstances, invests at least 40% of its\nmanaged assets in securities of foreign issuers in developed and emerging markets, including debt and equity securities of\ncorporate issuers and debt securities of government issuers. “Managed assets” means the Fund’s total assets (including any\nassets attributable to any leverage that may be outstanding) minus total liabilities (other than debt representing financial\nleverage).\nThe Fund seeks to maintain a balanced approach to geographic portfolio diversification. The Fund may invest up to 100%\nof its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers in developed and emerging markets, including debt and equity securities\nof corporate issuers and debt securities of government issuers. The Fund uses a number of investment strategies to achieve\nits objectives and invests in a wide variety of financial instruments. These instruments include global convertible, exchangeable\ninstruments, as well as “synthetic” convertible instruments. With regard to the synthetic convertible instruments, the fixed\nincome and convertible components may have different issuers, and either component may change at any time. The Fund\nalso invests in global equities or equity-linked securities with high income potential. From time to time, the Fund invests in\nRule144A securities, foreign exchange contracts or securities with imbedded foreign exchange hedges, and high yield bonds\nof companies rated BB or lower.\nIn general, the Fund seeks out companies with a long-term track record of high dividend payout consistent with dividend\ngrowth. In certain circumstances, the Fund may invest in underlying companies it believes have substantial prospects for\nprice appreciation even if the there is little or no dividend growth potential. From time to time, the Fund may sell index\noptions or single stock options (either listed or “over the counter”) to enhance the overall yield of the Fund or, in the opinion\nof the Adviser, reduce portfolio volatility. The Fund may purchase options to hedge or engage in other hedging activities\nincluding the purchase or sale of futures, swaps or options on equities, indices, currencies, interest rates or credits.\nThe Fund does not seek to maintain any target allocation among asset classes and, at any time, its allocation among asset\nclasses may vary significantly over time as the portfolio is actively managed.\nThe Fund may seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options. The Fund may write (sell) call\noptions (i)on a portion of the equity securities (including equity securities obtainable by the Fund through the exercise of its\nrights with respect to convertible securities it owns) in the Fund’s portfolio and (ii)on broad-based securities indices (such as\nthe Standard and Poor’s 500®Index (“S&P500”) or the MSCI EAFE®Index (“MSCI EAFE”), which is an index of international\nequity stocks) or certain ETFs (exchange traded funds) that trade like common stocks but seek to replicate such market\nindices.\nThe Fund currently uses, and may in the future use, financial leverage. The Fund has obtained financial leverage (i)under an\nAmended and Restated Liquidity Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“SSB Agreement”) that allows the\nFund to borrow up to $265 million and (ii)through the issuance of four series of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares\n(“MRPS” or “MRP Shares”) with an aggregate liquidation preference of $70 million.\nwww.calamos.com 73\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 1\nCHKSUM Content: 58447 Layout: 50406 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Global Total Return Fund\n(Unaudited)\nCALAMOS GLOBAL TOTAL RETURN FUND\nTOTAL RETURN*\nINVESTMENT TEAM DISCUSSION\nCommon Shares –Inception 10/27/05\nSince\n1 Year Inception** Please discuss the Fund’s strategy and role within an asset allocation.\nOn Market Price -0.98% 5.83% Calamos Global Total Return Fund (CGO) is a total-return-oriented offering that\nOn NAV 5.26% 6.76% seeks to provide an attractive monthly distribution.

For example,\ngeneral market sentiment or future expectations might influence the market price.\nA fund’s NAV return measures the actual return of the individual securities in the\nportfolio, less fund expenses. It also measures how a manager was able to\ncapitalize on market opportunities.

The Fund, under normal circumstances, will invest at least 50% of its managed assets in equity securities (including\nsecurities that are convertible into equity securities). The Fund may invest up to 100% of its managed assets in securities of\nforeign issuers, including debt and equity securities of corporate issuers and debt securities of government issuers, in\ndeveloped and emerging markets. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 40% of its managed assets in\nsecurities of foreign issuers. The Fund will invest in the securities of issuers of several different countries throughout the\nworld, in addition to the United States. “Managed assets” means the total assets of the Fund (including any assets attributable\nto any leverage that may be outstanding) minus the sub of accrued liabilities (other than debt representing financial leverage).\nFor this purpose, the liquidation preference on the preferred shares will not constitute a liability.\nCalamos will dynamically allocate the Fund’s investments among multiple asset classes (rather than maintaining a fixed or\nstatic allocation), seeking to obtain an appropriate balance of risk and reward on a long-term basis through all market cycles\nusing multiple strategies and combining them to seek to achieve favorable risk adjusted returns.\nThe Fund will attempt to keep a consistent balance between risk and reward over the course of different market cycles,\nthrough various combinations of stocks, bonds, and/or convertible securities, to achieve what Calamos believes to be an\nappropriate blend for the then current market. As the market environment changes, portfolio securities may change in an\nattempt to achieve a relatively consistent risk level over time. At some points in a market cycle, one type of security may\nmake up a substantial portion of the Fund’s portfolio, while at other times certain securities may have minimal or no\nrepresentation, depending on market conditions.\nThe Fund may also seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options (with an aggregate notional\nvalue of up to 33% of the value of the Fund’s managed assets). The Fund will opportunistically employ a strategy of writing\noptions. The extent of option writing activity will depend upon market conditions and Calamos’ ongoing assessment of the\nattractiveness of writing options on the Fund’s equity holdings. The Fund’s derivative activities are principally focused on the\nfollowing derivatives: interest rate swaps, convertible securities, synthetic convertible instruments, options on individual\nsecurities, index options and forward currency exchange contracts (“forward contracts”). However, the Fund reserves the right\nto invest in other derivative instruments to the extent it is consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and restrictions. The\nFund may write (sell) call options (i) on a portion of the equity securities (including equity securities obtainable by the Fund\nthrough the exercise of its rights with respect to convertible securities it owns) in the Fund’s portfolio and (ii)on broad-based\nsecurities indices (such as the Standard and Poor’s 500®Index (“S&P500”) or the MSCI EAFE®Index (“MSCI EAFE”), which is\nan index of international equity stocks) or certain ETFs (exchange traded funds) that trade like common stocks but seek to\nreplicate such market indices.\nUnder normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 50% of its managed assets in equity securities (including securities\nthat are convertible into equity securities). The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and convertible securities of any rating,\nincluding below investment grade. Equity securities, such as common stock, generally represent an ownership interest in a\ncompany. Therefore, the Fund participates in the financial success or failure of any company in which it has an equity interest.\nThe price of equity securities, particularly common stocks, are sensitive to general movements in the stock market.

(“Moody’s”) or “BB” or lower by\nStandard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (“Standard & Poor’s”), or are\nunrated securities of comparable quality as determined by Calamos, the Fund’s investment adviser. The Fund may invest in\nhigh yield securities of any rating. Nonconvertible debt securities rated below investment grade are commonly referred to as\n“junk bonds” and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal.\nThe Fund may invest up to 100% of its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers in developed and emerging markets,\nincluding debt and equity securities of corporate issuers and debt securities of government issuers. A foreign issuer is a\nforeign government or a company organized under the laws of a foreign country.\nThe Fund may invest in convertible securities. A convertible security is a debt security, debenture, note or preferred stock\nthat is exchangeable for an equity security (typically of the same issuer) at a predetermined price (the “conversion price”).\nDepending upon the relationship of the conversion price to the market value of the underlying security, a convertible security\nmay trade more like an equity security than a debt instrument. The Fund may invest in convertible securities of any rating.\nSecurities that are convertible into equity securities are considered equity securities for purposes of the Fund’s policy to invest\nat least 50% of its managed assets in equity securities.\nThe Fund may invest in “synthetic” convertible instruments. A synthetic convertible instrument is a financial instrument (or\ntwo or more securities held in tandem) that is designed to simulate the economic characteristics of another instrument\n(i.e., a convertible security) through the combined economic features of a collection of other securities or assets. Calamos\nmay create a synthetic convertible instrument by combining separate securities that possess the two principal characteristics\nof a true convertible security, i.e., a fixed-income security (“fixed-income component”, which may be a convertible or\nnon-convertible security) and the right to acquire an equity security (“convertible component”). The fixed-income component\nis achieved by investing in fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred stocks and money market instruments. The\nconvertible component is achieved by investing in warrants or options to buy common stock at a certain exercise price, or\noptions on a stock index.The fixed income and convertible components may have different issuers, and either component\nmay change at any time.\nThe Fund may also invest in synthetic convertible instruments created by third parties, typically investment banks. Synthetic\nconvertible instruments created by such parties may be designed to simulate the characteristics of traditional convertible\nsecurities or may be designed to alter or emphasize a particular feature. Synthetic convertible instruments may include\nstructured notes, equity-linked notes, mandatory convertibles and combinations of securities and instruments, such as a\ndebt instrument combined with a forward contract. The Fund’s holdings of synthetic convertible instruments are considered\nequity securities for purposes of the Fund’s policy to invest at least 50% of its managed assets in equity securities. If the\nFund purchases a synthetic convertible instrument, a component of which is an option, such option will not be considered\nan option for the purpose of the Fund’s limitations on options described below.\nThe Fund may invest without limit in certain securities (“Rule144A Securities”), such as convertible and debt securities, that\nare typically purchased in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the 1933 Act pursuant to Rule 144A\nunder that Act. Under the supervision and oversight of the Fund’s Board of Trustees, Calamos will determine whether\nRule144A Securities are liquid. Typically, the Fund purchases Rule144A Securities only if Calamos has determined them to\nbe liquid.\nThe securities in which the Fund invests may include zero coupon securities, which are debt obligations that are issued or\npurchased at a significant discount from face value. The discount approximates the total amount of interest the security will\naccrue and compound over the period until maturity or the particular interest payment date at a rate of interest reflecting\nthe market rate of the security at the time of issuance. Zero coupon securities do not require the periodic payment of interest.\nThese investments benefit the issuer by mitigating its need for cash to meet debt service, but generally require a higher rate\nof return to attract investors who are willing to defer receipt of cash. These investments may experience greater volatility in\nmarket value than US government or other securities that make regular payments of interest. The Fund accrues income on\nthese investments for tax and accounting purposes, which is distributable to shareholders and which, because no cash is\nreceived at the time of accrual, may require the liquidation of other portfolio securities to satisfy the Fund’s distribution\nwww.calamos.com 79\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 7\nCHKSUM Content: 4401 Layout: 34289 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Global Total Return Fund (CGO)\n(Unaudited)\nobligations, in which case the Fund will forego the opportunity to purchase additional income producing assets with the\nliquidation proceeds.

You can obtain\nperformance data current to the most recent month end by visiting\nwww.calamos.com.\nWhat factors influenced performance over the annual period?\nThe annual period was extraordinary by most standards, marked by both a\nEuropean war and the more recent war in the Middle East. Despite calls for a\nrecession, a healthy US job market, firm housing prices, and consumer spending\nall thwarted that expectation. The Federal Reserve made six rate increases over\nthe period (totaling an additional 225 basis points), bringing the target rate to\n5.25% –5.50%, a 22-year high. While many expected interest rate cuts to be on\nthe table in early 2024, that appears to be unlikely, even though inflationary\npressures appear to be abating.\nThe boyant mood earlier in the year was fueled by the promise of AI, strong\nsummer travel, and further disinflation—all amidst a resilient economy and healthy\nearnings releases. The consensus capitulated to this optimism, and we concluded\nthat the controlling narrative of disinflation momentum had run its course and\nwould give way to a more ambiguous outlook.\nThe key feature of the Q3 correction has been its controlled character, particularly\nin the context of the dramatic move higher in US interest rates. Our hesitation in\nturning outright bearish reflects the judgment that the US will remain in a\ndisinflation rather than deflation setting through 2024. The impressive GDP\nreleases for Q3 (+8.6% nominal) underline this momentum of US economic\nactivity, which implies the challenge for equities is a question of “price” rather\nthan fundamentals.\nPositive real interest rates imply a new emphasis on the time value of money. In\n2023, the market has rewarded high free cash flows that can compete with higher\nbond yields, high-quality balance sheets and secular thematic growth. Other\npockets of sectors and styles have been punished depending upon their sensitivity\nto higher rates. In 2022, higher rates primarily impacted the fast-growing\ntechnology and concept names. In Q3, the less profitable and higher leveraged\nnames were punished regardless of sector and style.\nFinally, 2023 has highlighted how powerful secular themes can overcome\ntraditional sector and style behavior. In a later-cycle environment where the rate\nof change for corporate fundamentals grinds to less exciting levels, investors can\n82 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: ~note-color 2, Black GRAPHICS: 28873-8_Long_Short_Eq_P.eps, 28873-8_Short_Eq_Dyn_L.eps V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 10\nCHKSUM Content: 49280 Layout: 29444 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Long/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust\n(Unaudited)\noverly discount the perceived winners and losers. This overshooting is likely true\nfor AI and obesity (GLP-1) drugs. We anticipate much of this fever pitch to reverse\nin 2024.\nHigh yield spreads were modestly tighter, closing at 437 basis points on an option-\nadjusted basis, down from 464 in the prior year. Despite the perceived stability,\nthe trading range for spreads during the period was 150 basis points wide,\nreflecting the volatility across markets. Lower quality outperformed as CCCs\nreturned 7.4%, B-rated paper returned 6.8%, and more rate-sensitive BBs\nreturned 5.3%. After increasing for most of the year, trailing 12-month defaults\ncame in at 2.6% on a par-weighted basis. We expect this measure to climb and\nclose the 2023 calendar year near the 3.0% post-GFC average. The best-\nperforming sectors in the Bloomberg US High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index were\nfinance companies (+10.9%), consumer cyclicals (+10.2%), and brokers and asset\nmanagers (+3.5), whereas communications (+0.8%), electric utilities (+3.1%), and\ntransportation (+3.3%) represented the significant laggards.\nFund Performance Drivers\nWe have focused on cyclicals that we believed were still poised to outperform due\nto the realization of pent-up demand post-pandemic, such as airlines, hotels,\ngaming, transportation, and defensive stocks, offering compelling valuations. We\nremain underweight in the poorest quality compartment of long-duration\ntechnology and high-multiple consumer staples but have maintained or increased\nexposure to mega-cap growth (quality GARP). We focused primarily on US\npositions because we believed opportunities were far less favorable abroad.\nGiven the overall positive market returns for the period, our hedges on US equity\nmarkets have not been helpful over the period.\nThe Fund’s long positions in communication services, consumer discretionary, and\ninformation technology as well as short positions on a market index later in the\nperiod were the largest contributors. Conversely, short positions in information\ntechnology, and long positions in industrials, financials, and health care\ncompanies, hindered performance. Both our long and short positions in the\nconsumer staples sector hindered performance over the period.\nPreferred Securities. On an unleveraged basis, the Fund’s preferred securities\nperformed in line with the ICE BofA United States All Capital Securities Index\nduring the period. Security selection among financials, namely property and\ncasualty insurance companies and energy companies focused onoil & gasstorage\nand transportation, contributed positively to returns. Security selection in real\nestate, namely other specialized REITs, and the overweight and selection in\ncommunication services, specifically alternative carriers,weighed on performance.\nHigh Yield. On an unleveraged basis, the Fund’s high-yield securities slightly\nunderperformed the Bloomberg US High Yield 2% Issuer Capped Index for the\nperiod. Here again, security selection within the energy services industry was\nhelpful to returns. In addition, the Fund’s security selection in health care, namely\nan overweight in facilities operators, aided returns. Conversely, the Fund’s selection\nin the materials sector, namely container companies, did not support performance,\nnor did the selection in the consumer discretionary sector, specifically in casinos\nand gaming companies.\nwww.calamos.com 83\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 11\nCHKSUM Content: 44649 Layout: 26025 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Long/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust\n(Unaudited)\nPlease discuss how the Fund uses leverage.\nGiven the general financial market improvement that occurred during the annual\nperiod, our use of leverage was accretive to performance both on an absolute\nand relative basis. Increased income earned on bond and preferred investments\nand rebates earned on our long/short hedging offset higher leverage costs.\nHowever, leverage can offer positive reinvestment dynamics over time and has\nhistorically been beneficial to the returns of our closed-end funds. Our percentage\nof leverage was 27% as of October31, 2023.\nHow is the Fund positioned?\nLong/Short Equity Strategy\nThe Fund’s Long/Short Sleeve underperformed relative to the MSCI ACWI ex USA\nIndex over the period. Net equity exposure (delta-adjusted) concluded the annual\nperiod at approximately 14% versus approximately 52% at the end of\nOctober2021. The Fund leaned modestly out of equity risk throughout the period\nas markets became unsettled by higher interest rates, persistent inflation, the\ninterpretation of Fed policy, the continuing war in Ukraine, a new war in the\nMiddle East, energy concerns in Europe, and increasing economic challenges for\nChina.\nThe two major themes within technology have been slowing cloud services and\nfurther excitement around potential applications for artificial intelligence (AI)\nfollowing the launch of ChatGPT. The major cloud providers dominate both\nthemes, and we are positioned accordingly. Investors began 2023 concerned\nabout slowing demand for such companies, yet attention quickly shifted to which\nones stands to benefit most by incorporating AI into existing and new product\nofferings.\nThe Fund has avoided the high multiple, long-duration software names in the past\nyear and this decision feels correct in a “higher for longer” rate setting. While the\ngroup’s sensitivity to rates is diminishing, many names are merely controversial\nrather than crowded and profitability is scarce if one factors in stock\ncompensation. It will take years before cash flows can credibly support current\nvaluations. Today’s “time value of money” implies investors will be slow to re-\nembrace “growth at any price.”\nOutside technology, the Fund favors names that will benefit from a sustained\neconomic expansion into 2024. At the end of the period, our largest exposure\nwas in industrials. The broadest exposures in the sector included diversified\nindustrials and transports. These rallied impressively in H1 but retreated sharply in\nQ3 2023.\nExposure to selective airlines remains intact. The pricing outlook for airfares should\nstay constructive for longer than expected due to structural changes on the\ncapacity front. Higher financing costs, pilot shortages, and equipment delays have\nmade it difficult for the lowest-cost players to add capacity. Meanwhile, the\nrecovery in corporate and international travel has gained steam. The post-\npandemic inflation surge implies the existing fleets of the legacy carriers cannot\nbe replaced anywhere near their embedded costs, with positive implications for\nfuture returns.\nRegarding consumer discretionary, also a large Fund position, the portfolio remains\nbiased away from goods in favor of services including core long positions in large\nhotel enterprises that benefit from corporate and international travel and\n84 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 12\nCHKSUM Content: 30345 Layout: 38534 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Long/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust\n(Unaudited)\nsustained revenue per available room (RevPAR) strength. We maintain select\nleisure-oriented names within the sector.\nHealth care is the one defensive sector where the Fund has been adding exposure.\nWe like its diversified growth theme, given the cyclicality of other parts of the\nportfolio, and its credible valuation versus other defensives. It has underperformed\nin 2023 but is showing relative strength against broader defensives.\nEnergy remains problematic. The key swing factor will be China, the primary\nsource of consumption growth in recent decades. The setup for higher crude\nprices was ideal in 2022, yet the inability of markets to benefit from the war-\nrelated shortage fears points to a new dynamic in global oil markets.\nFinancials have been controversial and banks have struggled to garner support in\nthe wake of the Marchcollapses. Higher rates, tepid loan demand, and reduced\ncapital returns in the face of heightened regulatory requirements have all weighed\non the industry. We reduced long exposures over the period.\nFinally, global investors have discovered the Chinese economic recovery from a\ndisastrous 2022 is underwhelming. There is hope for policy stimulus later in 2023,\nbut this overlooks China’s structural problems. China’s troubles start with an\nabrupt downshift in economic potential due to its overcommitment to a\ncentralized investment-led growth model, which can experience abrupt\ndownturns in return on invested capital.\nThis Achilles heel points to the necessity for far-reaching structural reforms, but\nthese are inherently political. The ability of the system to adapt is hindered by the\nreality that the entire system—interest rates, access to credit, tax policy, operating\nlicenses, and so forth—is geared to this model. We await the response of the\nChinese leadership in late autumn, whose success or failure to regenerate\neconomic vibrancy holds implications for global interest rates in 2024. We have\navoided China and had little exposure to other global markets throughout the\nperiod.\nDynamic Income Strategy\nIn preferreds, our largest allocation was in the financials sector, specifically banks.\nBanks are taking advantage of higher yields on securities and loans to generate\nhigher levels of net interest income, especially those with a low-cost core-deposit\nfunding model. This positive momentum has been offset partially by lower capital\nmarkets activity, including underwriting, advisory, and trading. Asset quality at\nbanks and other finance companies remains strong, as should be expected given\nhigh employment rates. Energy, utilities and communication services were other\nsectors with large preferreds exposures.\nAmong bond holdings, the Fund is currently overweight retailers, pharmaceuticals,\nand airlines. Several of our retail positions are secured by real estate portfolios\nwith conservative valuations. The Fund’s airline positions are mostly secured by\nplanes and loyalty programs. Consumer cyclical services, electric utilities, and\ntechnology industries comprise the Fund’s largest underweights. The underweight\nin consumer cyclical services is largely the result of relative value decisions in favor\nof higher-income opportunities in other industries.\nFrom a credit-quality perspective, the Fund is relatively underweight in below-\ninvestment-grade categories and has a corresponding out-of-benchmark\nallocation to BBB-rated debt.\nwww.calamos.com 85\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 13\nCHKSUM Content: 6687 Layout: 23321 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Long/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust\n(Unaudited)\nOver the annual period, the team has added to positions in the energy sector,\nprimarily through new positions in independent producers and midstream\ncompanies. New holdings in the leisure and automotive industries drove an\nincrease in consumer cyclical exposure. Also, we reduced the portfolio exposure\nto the other financial sector primarily by eliminating a commercial property\nmanagement company.\nThe market’s reaction to the November Fed meeting has driven Treasury yields\nfurther from the Fed’s expectations for its forward rate path. However, Powell\nnoted multiple times that the dot plots released quarterly should only be viewed\nas a snapshot in time that loses applicability with each incoming data point.\nFutures markets now indicate four rate cuts will occur in 2024, down from the\nfive cuts the market had priced in at the midyear point. Anticipating the Fed’s next\nmove has also led us to selectively reduce our leveraged loan positions, although\nwe maintain a significant loan allocation across mandates based on relative value\nand seniority considerations.\nIn our estimation, credit spreads reflect an outlook that is too sanguine. We are\nbeginning to see a deterioration in fundamentals within the leveraged finance\nspace. Although it is too early to determine if this is a wobble or a new trend\nforming, we are actively reducing exposure to credits we evaluate to be more\nexposed to a downturn in cyclical activity, those with weak contingent liquidity,\nor exposure to a rapid deterioration of asset value. Based on our fundamentally\ndriven investment philosophy, we believe there are select high-yield issuers who\nare compensating investors well for associated risks, and we are maintaining\nallocations in those areas.\nPlease discuss the Fund’s distributions during the annual period.\nWithin this Fund, we employ a managed distribution policy with the goal of\nproviding shareholders a consistent distribution stream. The monthly per share\ndistribution rate at the end of the period was $0.1400, up from $0.1100 at\ninception in November2019 and representing a 27% increase. Interest rates rose\nsharply during the annual period, and the yield on the 10-year US Treasury rose\nfrom 4.10% to 4.88% by period end, while S&P 500 stocks yielded 1.68% on\naverage.

Real\ninterest rates have risen more than 100 basis points in 2023, with much of this\nmove occurring since June. While equities have struggled in the past quarter, the\npullback has been orderly and, for the major equity benchmarks, underwhelming\ngiven the sizable move in rates.

The US 10-year yield has explained almost two-thirds of the\ncross-equity return distributions1 in 2023—one of the highest readings in six\ndecades.2 This implies that rate pressures are becoming acute in parts of the\neconomy regardless of its supportive features. These pressures need to culminate\nsoon in a manner that moderates economic activity and eases financial conditions\ninto 2024.\nProgress on inflation and surprisingly resilient economic growth allowed the\nFederal Reserve to pause its rate-hiking campaign at its September and\nNovember meetings. The extended pause allows the committee to evaluate\nincoming data for another six weeks. It’s clear the Fed is looking for continued\nimprovement in PCE Core Services (ex-housing). However, the message between\nthe Septemberand Novembermeetings changed. A recession is still not the base\ncase for the Fed, as they aim for a soft landing. But apart from inflation, they have\nbroadened the variables they are watching closely to determine whether an\nadequate level of restrictive policy has been met. Specifically, they are monitoring\nmore balance in the labor market and a broader set of financial conditions driven\nby markets.\nWe expect future months and quarters to show a drop in consumer and business\ninvestment as a reduction in disposable income through higher borrowing costs\nrolls into more areas of economic activity. We are squarely in the “impatiently\nwaiting” phase, looking to ascertain how much economic momentum will be lost\nfrom past policy changes. There is still a high level of uncertainty concerning\npotential economic outcomes, and a recession cannot be dismissed.\n1 The aggregate of individual stock deviations of performance versus the equity benchmark and the\ndegree to which these deviations are correlated (or explained) by movements in the US 10-year\nyield.\n2 Today’s result ranks in the top 15 readings of the past 70 years and more than 4X the average of\nthat period.\nwww.calamos.com 87\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.ce | Sequence: 15\nCHKSUM Content: 27343 Layout: 18148 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nCalamos Long/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust (CPZ)\n(Unaudited)\nINVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES\nInvestment Objective\nThe Fund’s investment objective is to seek current income and risk-managed capital appreciation.\nPrincipal Investment Strategies\nThe Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its managed assets in a globally diversified portfolio\ncomprised of equity securities which are defined to include common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities, and\nexchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) (the “Equity Sleeve”),* as well as long and short equity positions managed pursuant to a\nlong/short equity strategy (the “Long/Short Component”). The Long/Short Component will comprise at least 50% of the\nFund’s managed assets with a focus on absolute returns in a risk-managed format. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its\nmanaged assets opportunistically in globally diversified income-producing securities, including high-yield and investment\ngrade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt securities, securitized products, US Treasuries and sovereign debt\nissued by foreign governments (the “Fixed Income Sleeve”). “Managed assets” means the Fund’s total assets (including any\nassets attributable to any financial leverage that may be outstanding) minus the sum of liabilities (other than debt representing\nfinancial leverage).\nThe Fund will invest in common stock, preferred stock and convertible securities (including synthetic convertible instruments)\nissued by both US and foreign companies without regard to market capitalization. Convertible securities include, but are not\nlimited to, any corporate debt security, debentures, notes or preferred stock that may be converted into equity securities of\ncompanies around the world, including in emerging markets. A synthetic convertible instrument is a financial instrument (or\ntwo or more securities held in tandem) that is designed to simulate the economic characteristics of a convertible security\nthrough the combined features of a debt instrument and a security providing an option on an equity security.\nIn the Long/Short Component, the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by taking long positions in companies that\nare expected to outperform the equity markets, while taking short positions in companies that are expected to underperform\nthe equity markets and/or for hedging purposes. A long position arises where the Fund holds a security in its portfolio. The\nFund will have a short position where it sells a security it does not own by delivery of a borrowed security. The Fund may\nmaintain long and short positions through the use of derivative instruments, such as options, futures and forward contracts.\nThe Fund’s Long/Short Component utilizes a variety of methods to evaluate long and short equity investments of various\nmarket capitalizations to find securities that the Adviser believes offer the potential for capital gains, including common\nstock and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) of issuers of all market capitalizations, including other investment\ncompanies (including ETFs) that track or otherwise provide exposure to such sectors. As part of this strategy, the Adviser\nseeks to invest in industries, sectors and securities that it believes are more attractive on either a relative basis or on an\nabsolute basis. In addition to purchasing, or taking “long” positions in equity securities, the Fund’s investment strategy\nincludes short selling, and may include investments in derivatives, ETFs, and/or fixed income securities.\nIn the Fixed Income Sleeve, the Fund will mainly invest in a globally-diversified portfolio of income producing securities\nincluding, highyield and investment grade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt securities, securitized\nproducts, US Treasuries and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments. Some of the loans in which the Fund may invest\nmay be “covenant-lite” loans, which means the loans contain fewer or no maintenance covenants than other loans and do\nnot include terms which allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower and declare a default if certain criteria\nare breached.\nThe Fund may invest up to 50% of its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers; provided, however, the Fund will not\ninvest more than 25% of its managed assets in securities of issuers located in a single country other than the US and 20%\nof its managed assets in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its\nmanaged assets in securities of European domiciled issuers.\nThe Fund’s derivative activities are principally focused on the following derivatives: interest rate swaps, convertible securities,\nsynthetic convertible instruments, options on individual securities, index options, long calls, short calls, long puts, short puts\nand protective puts. The Fund may utilize derivatives for investment and hedging purposes. In addition, as a non-fundamental\npolicy, the Fund may also invest up to 20% of its managed assets in derivatives for non-hedging purposes.

In addition, the Adviser has appointed a committee consisting of senior management\n(the “CPZ Allocation Committee”) to determine the percentage of the Fund’s assets to be allocated to each such sleeve. The\nCPZ Allocation Committee meets quarterly, or more frequently if needed, to review and adjust the specific allocation ranges\nbased upon its judgment of economic, market and regulatory conditions in a manner consistent with the Fund’s investment\nobjective. Actual allocations may vary at any time due to market movements, changes in equity prices, changes in interest\nrates and other economic factors.\nThe Fund currently uses, and may in the future use, financial leverage. The Fund has obtained financial leverage under an\nAmended and Restated Liquidity Agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“SSB Agreement”) that allows the\nFund to borrow up to $150 million.\nTerm Structure\nThe Fund will dissolve on the twelfth anniversary of the effective date of the Fund’s registration statement (the “Dissolution\nDate”); provided, that if the Board of Trustees (the “Board”) believes that, under then-current market conditions, it is in the\nbest interests of the Fund to do so, the Fund may extend the Dissolution Date: (i)once for up to one year, and (ii)once for\nup to an additional six months, in each case upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board and without Shareholder\n(as defined below) approval. In addition, as of a date within twelve months preceding the Dissolution Date, the Board may\ncause the Fund to conduct a tender offer to all Shareholders to purchase Shares (as defined below) of the Fund at a price\nequal to the NAV per Share on the expiration date of the tender offer (the “Eligible Tender Offer”). The Board has established\nthat, following the Eligible Tender Offer, the Fund must have at least $100 million of net assets to ensure the continued\nviability of the Fund (the “Dissolution Threshold”). In the Eligible Tender Offer, the Fund will offer to purchase all Shares\ntendered by each Shareholder; provided, that if the number of properly tendered Shares would result in the Fund’s net assets\ntotaling less than the Dissolution Threshold, the Eligible Tender Offer will be terminated and no Common Shares will be\nrepurchased pursuant to the Eligible Tender Offer. Instead, the Fund will begin (or continue) liquidating or winding up its\nportfolio and proceed to dissolve on the Dissolution Date. The investment adviser to the Fund, Calamos, will pay all costs\nand expenses associated with the making of the Eligible Tender Offer, other than brokerage and related transaction costs\nassociated with disposition of portfolio investments in connection with the Eligible Tender Offer, which will be borne by the\nFund and its Shareholders. The Eligible Tender Offer, if pursued, will be made, and Shareholders will be notified thereof, in\naccordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and the\napplicable tender offer rules thereunder (including Rule13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act). If the number\nof properly tendered Shares would result in the Fund’s net assets totaling greater than the Dissolution Threshold, all Shares\nproperly tendered and not withdrawn will be purchased by the Fund pursuant to the terms of the Eligible Tender Offer.\nFollowing the completion of the Eligible Tender Offer, the Board may eliminate the Dissolution Date upon the affirmative\nvote of a majority of the Board and without Shareholder approval. In making a decision to eliminate the Dissolution Date to\nprovide for the Fund’s perpetual existence, the Board will take such actions with respect to the continued operations of the\nFund as it deems to be in the best interests of the Fund, based on market conditions at such time, the extent of Shareholder\nparticipation in the Eligible Tender Offer and all other factors deemed relevant by the Board in consultation with the Adviser,\ntaking into account that the Adviser may have a potential conflict of interest in seeking to convert to a perpetual trust. The\nFund is not a so called “target date” or “life cycle” fund whose asset allocation becomes more conservative over time as its\ntarget date, often associated with retirement, approaches. In addition, the Fund is not a “target term” fund whose investment\nobjective is to return its original NAV on the Dissolution Date. The Fund’s investment objective and policies are not designed\nto seek to return to investors that purchase Shares in this offering their initial investment of $20.00 per Share on the\nDissolution Date or in the Eligible Tender Offer, and such investors and investors that purchase Shares after the completion\nof this offering may receive more or less than their original investment upon dissolution or in the Eligible Tender Offer.\nwww.calamos.com 89\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 1\nCHKSUM Content: 42793 Layout: 2218 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nThe factors that are most likely to have a material effect on a particular Fund’s portfolio as a whole are called “principal\nrisks.” Each Fund is subject to the principal risks indicated below, whether through direct investment or derivative positions.\nEach Fund may be subject to additional risks other than those identified and described below because the types of investments\nmade by a Fund can change over time.\nPortfolio LevelRisks CPZ CGO CCD CSQ CHW CHI CHY\nAmerican Depositary Receipts Risk x x x x x x x\nAntitakeover Provisions x x x x x x x\nCash Holdings Risk x x x x x x x\nContingent Liabilities Risk x x x x x x x\nConvertible Hedging/Short Sales Risk x\nConvertible Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nCorrelation Risk x\nCounterparty and Settlement Risk x x x x x x x\nCovenant-Lite Loans Risk x x x x x x x\nCredit Risk x x x x x x x\nDebt Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nDecline in Net Asset Value Risk x x x x x x\nDefault Risk x x x x x x x\nDerivatives Risk x x x x x x x\nDiminished Voting Power and Excess Cash Risk x x x x x x x\nDuration Mismatch Risk x\nDuration Risk x x x x x x x\nEarly Redemption Risk x x x x x x x\nEmerging Markets Risk x x x x x x x\nEquity Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nFixed Income Securities Risk x\nForeign Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nForward Currency Exchange Contract Risks x x x x x x x\nFutures and Forward Contracts Risk x x x x\nGeneral Derivative Risks x\nGeographic Concentration Risk x x x\nGeographic Focus Risk x x x x\nHigh Yield Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nInterest Rate Risk x x x x x x x\nInterest Rate TransactionsRisk x x x x x x x\nLeverage Risk x\nLiquidity Risk x x x x x x x\nManagement Risk x x x x x x x\nMarket Discount Risk x\nMaster Limited Partnership Risk x x x x\nMaturity Risk x x x x x x x\nNon-Convertible Income Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nNon-US Government Obligation Risk x x x x x x\nOther Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk x x x x x x\nPortfolio Selection Risk x x x x x x x\nPortfolio Turnover Risk x x x x x x x\nPreferred Share Liquidation Preference Risk x\nRecent Market Events x x x x x x x\nREIT Risk x x x x x x\n90 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 2\nCHKSUM Content: 28863 Layout: 20193 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nPortfolio LevelRisks CPZ CGO CCD CSQ CHW CHI CHY\nRisks Associated with Options x x x x x x x\nRule144A Securities Risk x x x x x x x\nSector Risk x x x x x x x\nShort Selling Risk x x x\nSynthetic Convertible Instruments Risk x x x x x x x\nTax Risk x x x x x x x\nUS Government Security Risk x x x x x x x\nVolatility Risk x\nFund Leveland Other Risks CPZ CGO CCD CSQ CHW CHI CHY\nCurrency Risk x x x x x x x\nCybersecurity Risk x x x x x x x\nInflation Risk x x x x x x x\nLeverage Risk x x x x x x x\nLimited Term Risk x x\nLoan Risk x x x x x x x\nMarket Discount Risk x x x x x x x\nMarket Disruption Risk x x x x x x x\nMarket Impact Risk x x x x x x x\nRatings and Asset Coverage Risk x x x x x x x\nReduction of Leverage Risk x x x x x x x\nRegulatory Risk x\nSecondary Market Risk x x x x x x x\nSenior Leverage Risk x x x x x x\nwww.calamos.com 91\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 3\nCHKSUM Content: 5462 Layout: 51718 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nPortfolio Level Risks\nAmerican Depositary Receipts Risk. The stocks of most foreign companies that trade in the US markets are traded as\nADRs. US depositary banks issue these stocks. Each ADR represents one or more shares of foreign stock or a fraction of a\nshare. The price of an ADR corresponds to the price of the foreign stock in its home market, adjusted to the ratio of the\nADRs to foreign company shares. Therefore, while purchasing a security on a US exchange, the risks inherently associated\nwith foreign investing still apply to ADRs.\nAntitakeover Provisions. The Fund’s Agreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws include provisions that could limit\nthe ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund or to change the composition of its Board of Trustees.\nSuch provisions could limit the ability of shareholders to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by\ndiscouraging a third party from seeking to obtain control of the Fund. These provisions include staggered terms of office for\nthe Trustees, advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals, and super-majority voting requirements for certain\ntransactions with affiliates, converting the Fund to an open-end investment company or a merger, asset sale or similar\ntransaction. Holders of preferred shares have voting rights in addition to and separate from the voting rights of common\nshareholders with respect to certain of these matters. Holders of any preferred shares, voting separately as a single class,\nhave the right to elect at least two Trustees at all times. The holders of preferred shares or debt, if any, on the one hand, and\nthe holders of the common shares, on the other, may have interests that conflict with each other in certain situations,\nincluding conflicts that relate to the fees and expenses of the Fund.\nCash Holdings Risk.To the extent the Fund holds cash positions, the Fund risks achieving lower returns and potential lost\nopportunities to participate in market appreciation which could negatively impact the Fund’s performance and ability to\nachieve its investment objective.\nContingent Liabilities Risk.Entering into derivative contracts in order to pursue the Fund’s various hedging strategies could\nrequire the Fund to fund cash payments in the future under certain circumstances, including an event of default or other\nearly termination event, or the decision by a counterparty to request margin in the form of securities or other forms of\ncollateral under the terms of the derivative contract or applicable laws. The amounts due with respect to a derivative contract\nwould generally be equal to the unrealized loss of the open positions with the respective counterparty and could also include\nother fees and charges. These payments are contingent liabilities and therefore may not appear on the Fund’s balance sheet.\nThe Fund’s ability to fund these contingent liabilities will depend on the liquidity of the Fund’s assets and access to capital at\nthe time, and the need to fund these contingent liabilities could adversely impact the Fund’s financial condition.\nConvertible Hedging/Short Sales Risk. The Fund may incur a loss (without limit) as a result of a short sale if the market\nvalue of the borrowed security increases between the date of the short sale and the date the Fund replaces the security. The\nFund may be unable to repurchase the borrowed security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. If the market price\nof the common stock issuable upon exercise of a convertible security increases above the conversion price on the convertible\nsecurity, the price of the convertible security will increase. The Fund’s increased liability on the short position would, in whole\nor in part, reduce this gain. If the price of the common stock declines, any decline in the price of the convertible security\nwould offset, in whole or in part, the Fund’s gain on the short position. The use of short sales could increase the Fund’s\nexposure to the market, magnify losses and increase the volatility of returns.\nConvertible Securities Risk.The value of a convertible security is influenced by both the yield of non- convertible securities\nof comparable issuers and by the value of the underlying common stock. The value of a convertible security viewed without\nregard to its conversion feature (i.e., strictly on the basis of its yield) is sometimes referred to as its “investment value.” A\nconvertible security’s investment value tends to decline as prevailing interest rate levels increase. Conversely, a convertible\nsecurity’s investment value tends to increase as prevailing interest rate levels decline.\nCorrelation Risk.Imperfect correlation between the value of derivative instruments and the underlying assets of the Fund\ncreates the possibility that the loss on such instruments may be greater than the gain in the value of the underlying assets\nin the Fund’s portfolio.\nCounterparty and Settlement Risk (all Funds except CPZ).Trading options, futures contracts, swaps and other derivative\nfinancial instruments entails credit risk with respect to the counterparties with whom and through which the Fund trades.\nSuch instruments when traded over the counter do not include the same protections as may apply to trading derivatives on\norganized Calamos—We note that CPZ includes a more robust version of this risk disclosure.

Settlement mechanisms in emerging markets are generally less developed and reliable\nthan those in more developed countries, thus increasing the risks. In the past, broker-dealers and other financial institutions\nhave experienced extreme financial difficulty, sometimes resulting in bankruptcy of the institution. Although Calamos monitors\nthe creditworthiness of the Fund’s counterparties, there can be no assurance that the Fund’s counterparties will not experience\nsimilar difficulties, possibly resulting in losses to the Fund. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt, or otherwise fails to perform\nits obligations under a derivative contract due to financial difficulties, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining\nany recovery under the derivative contract in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Fund may obtain only a\nlimited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances. Material exposure to a single or small group of\ncounterparties increases the Fund’s counterparty risk.\nCounterparty and Settlement Risk (CPZ). Trading options, futures contracts, swaps and other derivative financial\ninstruments entails credit risk with respect to the counterparties with whom and through which the Fund trades. Such\ninstruments when traded over the counter do not include the same protections as may apply to trading derivatives on\norganized exchanges. Substantial losses may arise from the insolvency, bankruptcy or default of a counterparty and risk of\nsettlement default of parties with whom the Fund trades securities. This risk may be heightened during volatile market\nconditions. Settlement mechanisms in emerging markets are generally less developed and reliable than those in more\ndeveloped countries, thus increasing the risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the other party in a derivative transaction\nwill not fulfill its contractual obligation. Changes in the credit quality of the Fund’s counterparties with respect to its derivative\ntransactions may affect the value of those instruments. By entering into derivatives, the Fund assumes the risk that its\ncounterparties could experience financial hardships that could call into question their continued ability to perform their\nobligations. As a result, concentrations of such derivatives in any one counterparty would subject the Fund to an additional\ndegree of risk with respect to defaults by such counterparty.\n“Covenant-Lite” Loans Risk.Some of the loans in which the Fund may invest may be “covenant-lite” loans, which means\nthe loans contain fewer or no maintenance covenants than other loans and do not include terms which allow the lender to\nmonitor the performance of the borrower and declare a default if certain criteria are breached. The Fund may experience\ndelays in enforcing its rights on its holdings of covenant-lite loans.\nHowever, a convertible security’s market value tends to reflect the market price of the common stock of the issuing company\nwhen that stock price is greater than the convertible security’s “conversion price.” The conversion price is defined as the\npredetermined price at which the convertible security could be exchanged for the associated stock. As the market price of\nthe underlying common stock declines, the price of the convertible security tends to be influenced more by the yield of the\nconvertible security and changes in interest rates. Thus, the convertible security may not decline in price to the same extent\nas the underlying common stock. In the event of a liquidation of the issuing company, holders of convertible securities would\nbe paid before the company’s common stockholders.\nIf a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial\ndifficulties, such bankruptcy or failure to perform is likely to result in a default under such derivative contract, unless such\ndefault is cured. Default by a party with whom the Fund enters into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized\nprofits, leaving the Fund with unsecured exposure and force the Fund to cover its resale commitments, if any, at the then\ncurrent market price. It may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the\nhedging counterparty, and the Fund may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover its risk. The Fund\ncannot assure its shareholders that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and the\nFund may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses.\nFurthermore, upon the bankruptcy of a counterparty, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery\nunder the derivative contract in a dissolution, assignment for the benefit of creditors, liquidation, winding-up, bankruptcy,\nor other analogous proceeding. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of a counterparty to a derivative transaction, the\nderivative transaction would typically be terminated at its fair market value. If the Fund is owed this fair market value in the\ntermination of the derivative transaction and its claim is unsecured, the Fund will be treated as a general creditor of such\ncounterparty, and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying security. The Fund may obtain only a limited recovery\nor may obtain no recovery in such circumstances and the enforceability of agreements for hedging transactions may depend\non compliance with applicable statutory and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the\ncounterparty, applicable international requirements.\nwww.calamos.com 93\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 5\nCHKSUM Content: 29820 Layout: 43320 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nCertain interest rate and credit default swaps are subject to mandatory clearing, in which case a central clearing counterparty\nstands between each buyer and seller and effectively guarantees performance of each derivative contract, to the extent of\nits available resources for such purpose. As a result, the counterparty risk is now shifted from bilateral risk between the\nparties to the individual credit risk of the central clearing counterparty and the futures commission merchant through which\nthe Fund holds its cleared position. Even in such case, there can be no assurance that a clearing house, or its members, will\nsatisfy the clearing house’s obligations to the Fund. Uncleared derivatives have no such protection; each party bears the risk\nthat its direct counterparty will default.\nCredit Risk. An issuer of a fixed income security could be downgraded or default. If the Fund holds securities that have\nbeen downgraded, or that default on payment, the Fund’s performance could be negatively affected.\nDebt Securities Risk.The Fund may invest in debt securities, including corporate bonds and high yield securities. In addition\nto the risks described elsewhere in the Fund’s prospectus (such as high yield securities risk and interest rate risk), debt securities\nare subject to certain additional risks, including issuer risk and reinvestment risk. Issuer risk is the risk that the value of debt\nsecurities may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer, such as management performance, leverage\nand reduced demand for the issuer’s goods and services. Reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the Fund’s portfolio\nwill decline if the Fund invests the proceeds from matured, traded or called bonds at market interest rates that are below\nthe Fund portfolio’s current earnings rate. A decline in income could affect the market price of the Fund’s common shares\nor the overall return of the Fund.\nDecline in Net Asset Value Risk. A material decline in the Fund’s NAV may impair the Fund’s ability to maintain required\nlevels of asset coverage for any outstanding borrowings or any debt securities or preferred shares.\nDefault Risk.Default risk refers to the risk that a company that issues a convertible or debt security will be unable to fulfill\nits obligations to repay principal and interest. The lower a debt security is rated, the greater its default risk. As a result, the\nFund may incur cost and delays in enforcing its rights against the defaulting issuer.\nDerivatives Risk.Generally, derivatives are financial contracts whose value depends on, or is derived from, the value of an\nunderlying asset, reference rate or index, and may relate to individual debt or equity instruments, interest rates, currencies\nor currency exchange rates, commodities, related indexes and other assets. The Fund may utilize a variety of derivative\ninstruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, convertible securities, synthetic convertible\ninstruments, options on individual securities, index options, long calls, covered calls, long puts, cash-secured short puts and\nprotective puts for hedging, risk management and investment purposes.\nThe Fund’s use of derivative instruments involves investment risks and transaction costs to which the Fund would not be\nsubject absent the use of these instruments and, accordingly, may result in losses greater than if they had not been used.\nThe use of derivative instruments may have risks including, among others, leverage risk, duration mismatch risk, correlation\nrisk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, volatility risk, credit risk, management risk and counterparty risk. Derivatives also involve\nthe risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the risk that changes in the value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly\nwith an underlying asset, interest rate or index. Suitable derivative transactions may not be available in all circumstances and\nthere can be no assurance that the Fund will engage in these transactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would\nbe beneficial.\nFurthermore, the skills needed to employ derivatives strategies are different from those needed to select portfolio securities\nand, in connection with such strategies, the Fund makes predictions with respect to market conditions, liquidity, currency\nmovements, market values, interest rates and other applicable factors, which may be inaccurate. Thus, the use of derivative\ninstruments may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices below or above\nthe current market values, may limit the amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment or may cause the\nFund to hold a security that it might otherwise want to sell. Tax rules governing the Fund’s transactions in derivative\ninstruments may also affect whether gains and losses recognized by the Fund are treated as ordinary or capital, accelerate\nthe recognition of income or gains to the Fund, defer losses to the Fund, and cause adjustments in the holding periods of\nthe Fund’s securities, thereby affecting, among other things, whether capital gains and losses are treated as short-term or\nlong-term. These rules could therefore affect the amount, timing and/or character of distributions to shareholders. In addition,\nthere may be situations in which the Fund elects not to use derivative instruments that result in losses greater than if they\nhad been used. Amounts paid by the Fund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to\nthe Fund’s derivative instruments would not be available to the Fund for other investment purposes, which may result in lost\n94 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 6\nCHKSUM Content: 48259 Layout: 60095 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nopportunities for gain. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially\nlarge impact on Fund performance.\nDiminished Voting Power and Excess Cash Risk.The voting power of current shareholders will be diluted to the extent\nthat such shareholders do not purchase shares in any future common share offerings or do not purchase sufficient shares to\nmaintain their percentage interest. In addition, if the Fund is unable to invest the proceeds of such offering as intended, its\nper share distribution may decrease (or may consist of return of capital) and the Fund may not participate in market advances\nto the same extent as if such proceeds were fully invested as planned.\nDuration Mismatch Risk. The duration of a derivative instrument may be significantly different than the duration of the\nrelated liability or asset.\nDuration Risk.Duration measures the time-weighted expected cash flows of a fixed-income security, which can determine\nits sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates. The value of securities with longer durations tend to be more\nsensitive to interest rate changes than securities with shorter durations. The longer the Fund’s dollar-weighted average\nduration, the more its value can generally be expected to be sensitive to interest rate changes than a fund with a shorter\ndollar-weighted average duration. Duration differs from maturity in that it considers a security’s coupon payments in addition\nto the amount of time until the security matures. Various techniques may be used to shorten or lengthen the Fund’s duration.\nAs the value of a security changes over time, so will its duration.\nEarly Redemption Risk.The Fund may voluntarily redeem preferred shares or may be forced to redeem preferred shares to\nmeet regulatory requirements and the asset coverage requirements of the preferred shares. Such redemptions may be at a\ntime that is unfavorable to holders of the preferred shares\nEmerging Markets Risk. Emerging market countries may have relatively unstable governments and economies based on\nonly a few industries, which may cause greater instability. The value of emerging market securities will likely be particularly\nsensitive to changes in the economies of such countries. These countries are also more likely to experience higher levels of\ninflation, deflation or currency devaluations, which could adversely affect the value of the Fund’s investments and hurt those\ncountries’ economies and securities markets. Securities issued in these countries may be more volatile and less liquid than\nsecurities issued in foreign countries with more developed economies or markets. Loss may also result from the imposition\nof exchange controls, confiscations and other government restrictions, or from problems in share registration, settlement,\ncustody, or other operational risks.\nEquity Securities Risk.Equity investments are subject to greater fluctuations in market value than other asset classes as a\nresult of such factors as the issuer’s business performance, investor perceptions, stock market trends and general economic\nconditions. Equity securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms\nof priority to corporate income and liquidation payments. The Fund may invest in preferred stocks and convertible securities\nof any rating, including below investment grade.\nBelow investment grade securities or comparable unrated securities are considered predominantly speculative with respect\nto the issuer’s ability to pay interest and principal and are susceptible to default or decline in market value due to adverse\neconomic and business developments. The market values for below investment grade securities tend to be very volatile, and\nthese securities are generally less liquid than investment- grade debt securities. For these reasons, your investment in the\nFund is subject to the following specific risks:\n• increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment;\n• greater risk of loss due to default or declining credit quality;\n• adverse company specific events are more likely to render the issuer unable to make interest and/or principal payments;\nand\n• if a negative perception of the below investment grade market develops, the price and liquidity of below investment grade\nsecurities may be depressed. This negative perception could last for a significant period of time.\nFixed Income Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in fixed income securities, including corporate, municipal, and\ngovernment bonds. Fixed income securities are subject to the risk of decreasing value in periods of increasing interest rates,\nas well as the risk that the issuer of such securities could be downgraded or default, causing the credit rating of the securities\nto drop and thus generally decreasing the value of such securities.\nwww.calamos.com 95\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 7\nCHKSUM Content: 12842 Layout: 57627 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nForeign Securities Risk. Investments in non-US issuers may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of US\nissuers. These risks are more pronounced to the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its non-US investments\nin one region or in the securities of emerging market issuers. These risks may include:\n• less information may be available about non-US issuers or markets due to less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards\nor regulatory practices in foreign jurisdictions;\n• many non-US markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile. In a changing market, Calamos may not be able to sell the\nFund’s portfolio securities at times, in amounts and at prices it considers reasonable;\n• an adverse effect of currency exchange rate changes or controls on the value of the Fund’s investments;\n• the economies of non-US countries may grow at slower rates than expected or may experience a downturn or recession;\n• economic, political and social developments may adversely affect the securities markets in foreign jurisdictions, including\nexpropriation and nationalization;\n• the difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment in non-US countries;\n• restrictions on foreign investments in non-US jurisdictions;\n• difficulties in effecting the repatriation of capital invested in non-US countries;\n• withholding and other non-US taxes may decrease the Fund’s return;\n• the ability for the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which regulates auditors of US public companies, is unable\nto inspect audit work papers in certain foreign countries;\n• often limited rights and few practical remedies to pursue shareholder claims, including class actions or fraud claims, and\nthe ability of the Commission, the US Department of Justice and other authorities to bring and enforce actions against\nforeign issuers or foreign persons is limited; and\n• dividend income the Fund receives from foreign securities may not be eligible for the special tax treatment applicable to\nqualified dividend income.\nBased upon the Fund’s test for determining whether an issuer is a “foreign issuer”, it is possible that an issuer of securities\nin which the Fund invests could be organized under the laws of a foreign country, yet still conduct a substantial portion of\nits business in the US or have substantial assets in the US. In this case, such a “foreign issuer” may be subject to the market\nconditions in the US to a greater extent than it may be subject to the market conditions in the country of its organization.\nThere may be less publicly available information about non-US markets and issuers than is available with respect to US\nsecurities and issuers. Non-US companies generally are not subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards,\npractices and requirements comparable to those applicable to US companies. The trading markets for most non-US securities\nare generally less liquid and subject to greater price volatility than the markets for comparable securities in the United States.\nThe markets for securities in certain emerging markets are in the earliest stages of their development. Even the markets for\nrelatively widely traded securities in certain non-US markets, including emerging market countries, may not be able to absorb,\nwithout price disruptions, a significant increase in trading volume or trades of a size customarily undertaken by institutional\ninvestors in the United States. Additionally, market making and arbitrage activities are generally less extensive in such markets,\nwhich may contribute to increased volatility and reduced liquidity.\nEconomies and social and political conditions in individual countries may differ unfavorably from those in the United States.\nNon-US economies may have less favorable rates of growth of gross domestic product, rates of inflation, currency valuation,\ncapital reinvestment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments positions. Many countries have experienced\nsubstantial, and in some cases extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation\nrates have had, and may continue to have, very negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging\ncountries. Unanticipated political or social developments may also affect the values of the Fund’s investments and the\navailability to the Fund of additional investments in such countries.\nForward Currency Exchange Contracts Risk.Forward contracts are contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specified\ncurrency at a specified future date (or within a specified time period) at a price set at the time of the contract.

Futures contracts are standardized contracts\ntraded on a recognized exchange. An option on a futures contract gives the purchaser the right, in exchange for a premium,\nto assume a position in a futures contract at a specified exercise price during the term of the option. Futures and forward\ncontracts are subject to counterparty risk, meaning that the party who issues the derivatives (the clearinghouse or the broker\nholding the Fund’s position for a futures contract or the counterparty for a forward contract) may experience a significant\ncredit event and may be unwilling or unable to make timely settlement payments or otherwise honor its obligations.\nGeneral Derivative Risks.Derivatives also involve the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the risk that changes in\nthe value of a derivative may not correlate perfectly with an underlying asset, interest rate or index. Suitable derivative\ntransactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that the Fund will engage in these\ntransactions to reduce exposure to other risks when that would be beneficial. Furthermore, the skills needed to employ\nderivatives strategies are different from those needed to select portfolio securities and, in connection with such strategies,\nthe Fund may make predictions with respect to market conditions, liquidity, currency movements, market values, interest\nrates and other applicable factors, which may be inaccurate. Thus, the use of derivative instruments may require the Fund\nto sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices below or above the current market values, may limit\nthe amount of appreciation the Fund can realize on an investment or may cause the Fund to hold a security that it might\notherwise want to sell.

In addition, there may be situations in which the\nFund elects not to use derivative instruments that result in losses greater than if they had been used. Amounts paid by the\nFund as premiums and cash or other assets held in margin accounts with respect to the Fund’s derivative instruments would\nnot be available to the Fund for other investment purposes, which may result in lost opportunities for gain. Derivative\ninstruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and may have a potentially large impact on Fund\nperformance.\nGeographic Concentration Risk.Investments in a particular country or geographic region may be particularly susceptible\nto political, diplomatic or economic conditions and regulatory requirements. To the extent the Fund concentrates its\ninvestments in a particular country, region or group of regions, the Fund may be more volatile than a more geographically\ndiversified fund.\nGeographic Focus Risk.Investments in a particular country or geographic region may be particularly susceptible to political,\ndiplomatic or economic conditions and regulatory requirements. To the extent the Fund focuses its investments in a particular\ncountry, region or group of regions, the Fund may be more volatile than a more geographically diversified fund.\nHigh Yield Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in high yield securities of any rating. Investment in high yield securities\ninvolves substantial risk of loss. Below investment grade non-convertible debt securities or comparable unrated securities\nare commonly referred to as “junk bonds” and are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s ability\nto pay interest and principal and are susceptible to default or decline in market value due to adverse economic and business\ndevelopments. The market values for high yield securities tend to be very volatile, and these securities are less liquid than\ninvestment grade debt securities. For these reasons, your investment in the Fund is subject to the following specific risks:\n• increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment;\n• greater risk of loss due to default or declining credit quality;\n• adverse company specific events are more likely to render the issuer unable to make interest and/or principal payments;\nand\n• if a negative perception of the high yield market develops, the price and liquidity of high yield securities may be depressed.\nThis negative perception could last for a significant period of time.\nwww.calamos.com 97\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 9\nCHKSUM Content: 36168 Layout: 57627 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nAdverse changes in economic conditions are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of a high yield issuer to make\nprincipal payments and interest payments than an investment grade issuer. The principal amount of high yield securities\noutstanding has proliferated in the past decade as an increasing number of issuers have used high yield securities for corporate\nfinancing. An economic downturn could severely affect the ability of highly leveraged issuers to service their debt obligations\nor to repay their obligations upon maturity. The Fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek\nrecovery upon a default in payment of principal or interest on its portfolio holdings. In certain circumstances, the Fund may\nbe required to foreclose on an issuer’s assets and take possession of its property or operations. In such circumstances, the\nFund would incur additional costs in disposing of such assets and potential liabilities from operating any business acquired.\nThe secondary market for high yield securities may not be as liquid as the secondary market for more highly rated securities,\na factor which may have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to dispose of a particular security. There are fewer dealers in\nthe market for high yield securities than for investment grade obligations. The prices quoted by different dealers may vary\nsignificantly and the spread between the bid and asked price is generally much larger than for higher quality instruments.\nUnder adverse market or economic conditions, the secondary market for high yield securities could contract further,\nindependent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular issuer, and these instruments may become\nilliquid. As a result, the Fund could find it more difficult to sell these securities or may be able to sell the securities only at\nprices lower than if such securities were widely traded. Prices realized upon the sale of such lower rated or unrated securities,\nunder these circumstances, may be less than the prices used in calculating the Fund’s NAV.\nInterest Rate Risk. In addition to the risks described above, debt securities, including high yield securities, are subject to\ncertain risks, including:\n• if interest rates go up, the value of debt securities in the Fund’s portfolio generally will decline;\n• during periods of declining interest rates, the issuer of a security may exercise its option to prepay principal earlier than\nscheduled, forcing the Fund to reinvest in lower yielding securities. This is known as call or prepayment risk. Debt securities\nfrequently have call features that allow the issuer to repurchase the security prior to its stated maturity. An issuer may\nredeem an obligation if the issuer can refinance the debt at a lower cost due to declining interest rates or an improvement\nin the credit standing of the issuer;\n• during periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain types of securities may be extended because of slower\nthan expected principal payments. This may lock in a below market interest rate, increase the estimated period until the\nsecurity is paid in full and reduce the value of the security. This is known as extension risk;\n• rising interest rates could result in an increase in the cost of the Fund’s leverage and could adversely affect the ability of\nthe Fund to meet asset coverage requirements with respect to leverage;\n• variable rate securities generally are less sensitive to interest rate changes but may decline in value if their interest rates do\nnot rise as much, or as quickly, as interest rates in general. When the Fund holds variable rate securities, a decrease in\nmarket interest rates will adversely affect the income received from such securities and the NAV of the Fund’s shares; and\n• to the extent the Federal Reserve Board continues to raise interest rates, there is a risk that interest rates across the financial\nsystem may also rise. Increases in volatility and interest rates in the fixed-income market may expose the Fund to heightened\ninterest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Transactions Risk. The Fund may enter into an interest rate swap, cap or floor transaction to attempt to\nprotect itself from increasing dividend or interest expenses on its leverage resulting from increasing short-term interest rates\nand to hedge its portfolio securities. A decline in interest rates may result in a decline in the value of the swap or cap, which\nmay result in a decline in the NAV of the Fund.\nDepending on the state of interest rates in general, the Fund’s use of interest rate swap or cap transactions could enhance\nor harm the overall performance of the common shares. To the extent there is a decline in interest rates, the value of the\ninterest rate swap or cap could decline and could result in a decline in the NAV of the common shares. In addition, if the\ncounterparty to an interest rate swap or cap defaults, the Fund would not be able to use the anticipated net receipts under\nthe swap or cap to offset the dividend or interest payments on the Fund’s leverage or offset certain losses in its portfolio.\nDepending on whether the Fund would be entitled to receive net payments from the counterparty on the swap or cap,\nwhich in turn would depend on the general state of short-term interest rates at that point in time, such a default could\nnegatively impact the performance of the common shares. In addition, at the time an interest rate swap or cap transaction\n98 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 10\nCHKSUM Content: 16067 Layout: 27101 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nreaches its scheduled termination date, there is a risk that the Fund would not be able to obtain a replacement transaction\nor that the terms of the replacement would not be as favorable as on the expiring transaction. If either of these events\noccurs, it could have a negative impact on the performance of the common shares.\nIf the Fund fails to maintain a required 200% asset coverage of the liquidation value of any outstanding preferred shares or\nif the Fund loses its rating on its preferred shares or fails to maintain other covenants with respect to the preferred shares,\nthe Fund may be required to redeem some or all of the preferred shares. Similarly, the Fund could be required to prepay the\nprincipal amount of any debt securities or other borrowings. Such redemption or prepayment would likely result in the Fund\nseeking to terminate early all or a portion of any swap or cap transaction. Early termination of a swap could result in a\ntermination payment by or to the Fund. Early termination of a cap could result in a termination payment to the Fund. The\nFund intends to segregate with its custodian cash or liquid securities having a value at least equal to the Fund’s net payment\nobligations under any swap transaction, marked-to-market daily.\nCurrently, certain categories of interest rate swaps are subject to mandatory clearing, and more are expected to be cleared\nin the future. The counterparty risk for cleared derivatives is generally lower than for uncleared OTC derivative transactions\nbecause generally a clearing organization becomes substituted for each counterparty to a cleared derivative contract and, in\neffect, guarantees the parties’ performance under the contract as each party to a trade looks only to the clearing house for\nperformance of financial obligations. However, there can be no assurance that a clearing house, or its members, will satisfy\nthe clearing house’s obligations to the Fund.\nLeverage Risk. The derivative instruments in which the Fund may invest will give rise to forms of financial leverage, which\nmay magnify the risk of owning such instruments. Derivatives generally involve leverage in the sense that the investment\nexposure created by the derivatives may be significantly greater than the Fund’s initial investment in the derivative. Accordingly,\nif the Fund enters into a derivative transaction, it could lose substantially more than the principal amount invested.\nAdditionally, as a closed-end investment company registered with the SEC, the Fund is subject to the federal securities laws,\nincluding the 1940Act, the rules thereunder, and various SEC and SEC staff interpretive positions. In accordance with these\nlaws, rules and positions, the Fund may “set aside” liquid assets (often referred to as “asset segregation”), or engage in\nother SEC or staff-approved measures, to “cover” open positions with respect to certain portfolio management techniques,\nsuch as engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, dollar rolls, entering into credit default swaps or futures contracts, or\npurchasing securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis, that may be considered senior securities under the 1940Act.\nThe Fund intends to cover its derivative positions by maintaining an amount of cash or liquid securities in a segregated\naccount equal to the face value of those positions and by offsetting derivative positions against one another or against other\nassets to manage the effective market exposure resulting from derivatives in its portfolio. To the extent that the Fund does\nnot segregate liquid assets or otherwise cover its obligations under such transactions, such transactions will be treated as\nsenior securities representing indebtedness for purposes of the requirement under the 1940Act that the Fund may not enter\ninto any such transactions if the Fund’s borrowings would thereby exceed 33 1/3% of its managed assets, less all liabilities\nand indebtedness of the Fund not represented by senior securities. However, these transactions, even if covered, may\nrepresent a form of economic leverage and will create risks. In addition, these segregation and coverage requirements could\nresult in the Fund maintaining securities positions that it would otherwise liquidate, segregating assets at a time when it\nmight be disadvantageous to do so or otherwise restricting portfolio management. Such segregation and cover requirements\nwill not limit or offset losses on related positions.\nLiquidity Risk.The Fund may invest without limit in securities that, at the time of investment, are illiquid (i.e., any investment\nthat the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less\nwithout the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment). The Fund may also invest without\nlimit in Rule144A Securities determined to be liquid. Calamos, under the supervision and oversight of the Board of Trustees,\nwill determine whether Rule144A Securities are illiquid (that is, not readily marketable). Illiquid securities may be difficult to\ndispose of at a fair price at the times when the Fund believes it is desirable to do so. Investment of the Fund’s assets in illiquid\nsecurities may restrict the Fund’s ability to take advantage of market opportunities. The market price of illiquid securities\ngenerally is more volatile than that of more liquid securities, which may adversely affect the price that the Fund pays for or\nrecovers upon the sale of illiquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value and may be fair valuedin which\ncase Calamos’ judgment may play a greater role in the valuation process. The risks associated with illiquid securities may be\nparticularly acute in situations in which the Fund’s operations require cash and could result in the Fund borrowing to meet\nits short-term needs or incurring losses on the sale of illiquid securities. The Fund may also invest without limitation in\nsecurities that have not been registered for public sale, but that are eligible for purchase and sale by certain qualified\ninstitutional buyers.\nwww.calamos.com 99\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 11\nCHKSUM Content: 65518 Layout: 57627 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nManagement Risk. Calamos’ judgment about the attractiveness, relative value or potential appreciation of a particular\nsector, security or investment strategy may prove to be incorrect.\nMarket Discount Risk.The market price of exchanged-listed preferred shares that the Fund may issue may also be affected\nby such factors as the Fund’s use of leverage, dividend stability, portfolio credit quality, liquidity, and the Fund’s dividends\npaid (which are, in turn, affected by expenses), call protection for portfolio securities and interest rate movements.\nMaster Limited Partnerships Risk.Investments in MLPs involve risks that differ from investments in common stock. Holders\nof MLP common units are subject to certain risks inherent in the structure of MLPs, including (i)tax risks, (ii)risk related to\nlimited control of management or the general partner or managing member, (iii)limited rights to vote on matters affecting\nthe MLP, except with respect to extraordinary transactions, (iv)conflicts of interest between the general partner or managing\nmember and its affiliates, on the one hand, and the limited partners or members, on the other hand, including those arising\nfrom incentive distribution payments or corporate opportunities, and (v)cash flow risks. MLP common units and other equity\nsecurities can be affected by macro-economic and other factors affecting the stock market in general, expectations of interest\nrates, investor sentiment towards MLPs or the energy sector, changes in a particular issuer’s financial condition, or unfavorable\nor unanticipated poor performance of a particular issuer (in the case of MLPs, generally measured in terms of distributable\ncash flow). Prices of common units of individual MLPs and other equity securities also can be affected by fundamentals\nunique to the partnership or company, including cash flow growth, cash generating power and distribution coverage.\nAlthough certain MLPs may trade on national securities exchanges, certain MLPs may trade less frequently than those of\nlarger companies due to their market capitalizations. Due to limited trading volumes of certain MLPs, the prices of such MLPs\nmay display abrupt or erratic movements at times. Additionally, it may be more difficult for the Fund to buy and sell significant\namounts of such securities without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices. The Fund’s investment in securities\nthat are less actively traded or over time experience decreased trading volume may restrict its ability to dispose of the securities\nat a fair price. Such a situation may prevent the Fund from limiting losses or realizing gains. This also may adversely affect\nthe Fund’s ability to make dividend distributions to shareholders.\nMLPs are generally treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes. Partnerships do not pay US federal income\ntax at the partnership level. Rather, each partner is allocated a share of the partnership’s income, gains, losses, deductions\nand expenses. A change in current tax law, or a change in the business of a given MLP, could result in an MLP being treated\nas a corporation for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP\nwould be reduced and the after-tax return to the Fund with respect to its investment in such MLPs would be materially\nreduced. Thus, if any of the MLPs owned by the Fund were treated as corporations for US federal income tax purposes, it\ncould result in a reduction in the value of the Fund.\nMaturity Risk. Interest rate risk will generally affect the price of a fixed income security more if the security has a longer\nmaturity. Fixed income securities with longer maturities will therefore be more volatile than other fixed income securities\nwith shorter maturities. Conversely, fixed income securities with shorter maturities will be less volatile but generally provide\nlower potential returns than fixed income securities with longer maturities. The average maturity of the Fund’s investments\nmay affect the volatility of the Fund’s share price.\nNon-Convertible Income Securities Risk. The Fund will also invest in non-convertible income securities. The Fund’s\ninvestments in non-convertible income securities may have fixed or variable principal payments and all types of interest rate\nand dividend payment and reset terms, including fixed rate, adjustable rate, zero coupon, contingent, deferred, payment in\nkind and auction rate features. Recent events in the fixed-income markets, including the potential impact of the Federal\nReserve Board tapering its quantitative easing program, may expose the Fund to heightened interest rate risk and volatility\nas a result of a rise in interest rates. In addition, the Fund is subject to the risk that interest rates may exhibit increased\nvolatility, which could cause the Fund’s net asset value (“NAV”) to fluctuate more. A decrease in fixed-income market maker\ncapacity may act to decrease liquidity in the fixed-income markets and act to further increase volatility, affecting the Fund’s\nreturn.\nNon-US Government Obligation Risk. An investment in debt obligations of non-US governments and their political\nsubdivisions involves special risks that are not present in corporate debt obligations. The non-US issuer of the sovereign debt\nor the non-US governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal\nor interest when due, and the Fund may have limited recourse in the event of a default. During periods of economic\nuncertainty, the market prices of sovereign debt may be more volatile than prices of debt obligations of US issuers.\n100 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 12\nCHKSUM Content: 10767 Layout: 25640 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nOther Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk.Investments in the securities of other investment companies, including\nETFs, may involve duplication of advisory fees and certain other expenses. By investing in another investment company or\nETF, the Fund becomes a shareholder thereof. As a result, Fund shareholders indirectly bear the Fund’s proportionate share\nof the fees and expenses indirectly paid by shareholders of the other investment company or ETF, in addition to the fees and\nexpenses Fund shareholders bear in connection with the Fund’s own operations. If the investment company or ETF fails to\nachieve its investment objective, the value of the Fund’s investment will decline, adversely affecting the Fund’s performance.\nIn addition, closed-end investment company and ETF shares potentially may trade at a discount or a premium and are subject\nto brokerage and other trading costs, which could result in greater expenses to the Fund. In addition, the Fund may engage\nin short sales of the securities of other investment companies. When the Fund shorts securities of another investment\ncompany, it borrows shares of that investment company which it then sells. The Fund closes out a short sale by purchasing\nthe security that it has sold short and returning that security to the entity that lent the security.\nPortfolio Selection Risk. The value of your investment may decrease if the investment adviser’s judgment about the\nattractiveness, value or market trends affecting a particular security, issuer, industry or sector or about market movements is\nincorrect.\nPortfolio Turnover Risk. The portfolio managers may actively and frequently trade securities or other instruments in the\nFund’s portfolio to carry out its investment strategies. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may\nincrease the Fund’s expenses. Frequent and active trading may also cause adverse tax consequences for investors in the Fund\ndue to an increase in short term capital gains.\nPreferred Share Liquidation Preference Risk.Preferred shares, if issued and outstanding, will be junior in liquidation and\nwith respect to distribution rights to debt securities and any other borrowings. Senior securities representing indebtedness\nmay constitute a substantial lien and burden on preferred shares by reason of their prior claim against our income and against\nour net assets in liquidation. The Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other distributions with respect to any\nseries of preferred shares unless at such time the Fund meets applicable asset coverage requirements and the payment of\nprincipal or interest is not in default with respect to any borrowings.\nRecent Market Events.Since the 2008 financial crisis, financial markets throughout the world have experienced increased\nperiods of volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty and turmoil. This turmoil resulted\nin unusual and extreme volatility in the equity and debt markets, in the prices of individual securities and in the world\neconomy. Events that have contributed to these market conditions include, but are not limited to, major cybersecurity events,\ngeopolitical events (such aswars(including Russia’s military invasion of the Ukraine),terror attacks, natural or environmental\ndisasters, country instability,and public health emergencies), measures to address budget deficits, downgrading of sovereign\ndebt, declines in oil and commodity prices, dramatic changes in currency exchange rates, and public sentiment. In addition,\nmany governments and quasi-governmental entities throughout the world have responded to the turmoil with a variety of\nsignificant fiscal and monetary policy changes, including, but not limited to, direct capital infusions into companies, new\nmonetary programs and dramatically lower interest rates.\nThe full extent of the political, economic and legal consequences of Brexit are not yet fully known, and the long-term impact\nof Brexit on the UK, the EU and the broader global economy may be significant. As a result of the political divisions within\nthe UK and between the UK and the EU that the referendum vote has highlighted and the uncertain consequences of Brexit,\nthe UK and European economies and the broader global economy could be significantly impacted, potentially resulting in\nincreased market volatility and illiquidity, political, economic, and legal uncertainty, and lower economic growth for companies\nthat rely significantly on Europe for their business activities and revenues. Any further exits from the EU, or the possibility of\nsuch exits, or the abandonment of the Euro, may cause additional market disruption globally and introduce new legal and\nregulatory uncertainties.\nIn addition, policy and legislative changes in the United States and in other countries are changing many aspects of financial\nregulation. The impact of these changes on the markets, and the practical implications for market participants, may not be\nfully known for some time. Widespread disease and virus epidemics and pandemics, such as the coronavirus outbreak, could\nlikewise be highly disruptive, adversely affecting individual companies, sectors, industries, markets, currencies, interest and\ninflation rates, credit ratings, investor sentiment, and other factors affecting the value of the Fund’s investments.\nREIT Risk.Investing in real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) involves certain unique risks in addition to those risks associated\nwith investing in the real estate industry in general. An equity REIT may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying\nproperties owned by the REIT. A mortgage REIT may be affected by changes in interest rates and the ability of the issuers of\nwww.calamos.com 101\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 13\nCHKSUM Content: 40176 Layout: 57627 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nits portfolio mortgages to repay their obligations. REITs are dependent upon the skills of their managers and are not diversified.\nREITs are generally dependent upon maintaining cash flows to repay borrowings and to make distributions to shareholders\nand are subject to the risk of default by lessees or borrowers. REITs whose underlying assets are concentrated in properties\nused by a particular industry, such as health care, are also subject to risks associated with such industry.\nREITs (especially mortgage REITs) are also subject to interest rate risks. When interest rates decline, the value of a REIT’s\ninvestment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of a REIT’s\ninvestment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to decline. If the REIT invests in adjustable rate mortgage loans the\ninterest rates on which are reset periodically, yields on a REIT’s investments in such loans will gradually align themselves to\nreflect changes in market interest rates. This causes the value of such investments to fluctuate less dramatically in response\nto interest rate fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations.\nREITs may have limited financial resources, may utilize significant amounts of leverage, may trade less frequently and in a\nlimited volume and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically,\nREITs have been more volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in Standard& Poor’s 500 Stock Index.\nRisks Associated with Options(all Funds except CPZ).There are several risks associated with transactions in options. For\nexample, there are significant differences between the securities markets and options markets that could result in an imperfect\ncorrelation among these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. A decision as to whether, when\nand how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well- conceived transaction may be\nunsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. The Fund’s ability to utilize options\nsuccessfully will depend on Calamos’ ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured.\nThe Fund may sell options on individual securities and securities indices. All call options sold by the Fund must be “covered.”\nEven though the Fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss, a call option sold by the Fund exposes\nthe Fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the\nunderlying security or instrument and may require the Fund to hold a security or instrument that it might otherwise have\nsold. In addition, a loss on a call option sold may be greater than the premium received. The Fund may purchase and sell put\noptions on individual securities and securities indices. In selling put options, there is a risk that the Fund may be required to\nbuy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price.\nRisks Associated with Options (CPZ).The Fund may use options, including on the Fund’s convertible securities or during\nthe creation of synthetic convertible instruments. There are several risks associated with transactions in options. For example,\nthere are significant differences between the securities markets and options markets that could result in an imperfect\ncorrelation among these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. A decision as to whether, when\nand how to use options involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived transaction may be\nunsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events. The Fund’s ability to utilize options\nsuccessfully will depend on Calamos’ ability to predict pertinent market movements, which cannot be assured.\nThe Fund intends to seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options. The Fund may write (sell)\ncall options (i)on a portion of the equity securities (including securities that are convertible into equity securities) in the Fund’s\nportfolio, (ii) on a portion of the equity securities the Fund has a right to receive upon conversion of a convertible security\nthat it owns at the time it writes the call, and (iii)on broad-based securities indexes (such as the S&P500 or MSCI EAFE) or\ncertain ETFs that trade like common stocks but seek to replicate such market indexes. All call options sold by the Fund must\nbe “covered”, other than those sold in the Long/Short Component. For example, a call option written by the Fund will\nrequire the Fund to hold the securities subject to the call (or securities convertible into the needed securities without additional\nconsideration) or to segregate cash or liquid assets sufficient to purchase and deliver the securities if the call is exercised.\nEven though the Fund will receive the option premium to help protect it against loss, a call option sold by the Fund exposes\nthe Fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize appreciation in the market price of the\nunderlying security or instrument and may require the Fund to hold a security or instrument that it might otherwise have\nsold. The Fund may purchase and sell put options on individual securities and securities indices. In selling put options, there\nis a risk that the Fund may be required to buy the underlying security at a disadvantageous price above the market price. A\nput option written by the Fund requires the Fund to segregate cash or liquid assets equal to the exercise price minus any\nmargin the Fund is required to post.\nRule144A Securities Risk.The Fund may invest in securities that are issued and sold through transactions under Rule144A\nof the Securities Act of 1933. Under the supervision and oversight of the Board of Trustees, Calamos will determine whether\n102 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 14\nCHKSUM Content: 33753 Layout: 19776 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nRule 144A Securities are illiquid. If qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to purchase these Rule 144A Securities, the\npercentage of the Fund’s assets invested in illiquid securities would increase. Typically, the Fund purchases Rule144A Securities\nonly if the Fund’s adviser has determined them to be liquid. If any Rule 144A Security held by the Fund should become\nilliquid, the value of the security may be reduced and a sale of the security may be more difficult.\nSector Risk. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in a particular sector, a greater portion of the\nFund’s performance may be affected by the general business and economic conditions affecting that sector. Each sector may\nshare economic risk with the broader market, however there may be economic risks specific to each sector. As a result,\nreturns from those sectors may trail returns from the overall stock market and it is possible that the Fund may underperform\nthe broader market, or experience greater volatility.\nShort Selling Risk.The Fund will engage in short sales for investment and risk management purposes, including when the\nAdviser believes an investment will underperform due to a greater sensitivity to earnings growth of the issuer, default risk or\ninterest rates. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political conditions, the Fund may not be able,\nfully or partially, to implement its short selling strategy. Periods of unusual or adverse market, economic, regulatory or political\nconditions may exist for extended periods of time.\nShort sales are transactions in which the Fund sells a security or other instrument that it does not own but can borrow in the\nmarket. Short selling allows the Fund to profit from a decline in market price to the extent such decline exceeds the transaction\ncosts and the costs of borrowing the securities and to obtain a low cost means of financing long investments that the Adviser\nbelieves are attractive. If a security sold short increases in price, the Fund may have to cover its short position at a higher\nprice than the short sale price, resulting in a loss. The Fund will have substantial short positions and must borrow those\nsecurities to make delivery to the buyer under the short sale transaction. The Fund may not be able to borrow a security that\nit needs to deliver or it may not be able to close out a short position at an acceptable price and may have to sell related long\npositions earlier than it had expected. Thus, the Fund may not be able to successfully implement its short sale strategy due\nto limited availability of desired securities or for other reasons. Also, there is the risk that the counterparty to a short sale\nmay fail to honor its contractual terms, causing a loss to the Fund.\nGenerally, the Fund will have to pay a fee or premium to borrow securities and will be obligated to repay the lender of the\nsecurity any dividends or interest that accrues on the security during the term of the loan. The amount of any gain from a\nshort sale will be decreased, and the amount of any loss increased, by the amount of such fee, premium, dividends, interest\nor expense the Fund pays in connection with the short sale.\nUntil the Fund replaces a borrowed security, it may be required to maintain a segregated account of cash or liquid assets\nwith a broker or custodian to cover the Fund’s short position. Generally, securities held in a segregated account cannot be\nsold unless they are replaced with other liquid assets. The Fund’s ability to access the pledged collateral may also be impaired\nin the event the broker becomes bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of the contract. In such\ninstances the Fund may not be able to substitute or sell the pledged collateral and may experience significant delays in\nobtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. The Fund may obtain only a limited recovery or\nmay obtain no recovery in these circumstances. Additionally, the Fund must maintain sufficient liquid assets (less any additional\ncollateral pledged to the broker), marked-to-market daily, to cover the borrowed securities obligations. This may limit the\nFund’s investment flexibility, as well as its ability to meet other current obligations.\nBecause losses on short sales arise from increases in the value of the security sold short, such losses are theoretically unlimited.\nBy contrast, a loss on a long position arises from decreases in the value of the security and is limited by the fact that a\nsecurity’s value cannot decrease below zero. The Adviser’s use of short sales in combination with long positions in the Fund’s\nportfolio in an attempt to improve performance or reduce overall portfolio risk may not be successful and may result in\ngreater losses or lower positive returns than if the Fund held only long positions. It is possible that the Fund’s long securities\npositions will decline in value at the same time that the value of its short securities positions increase, thereby increasing\npotential losses to the Fund. In addition, the Fund’s short selling strategies will limit its ability to fully benefit from increases\nin the fixed-income markets.\nBy investing the proceeds received from selling securities short, the Fund could be deemed to be employing a form of\nleverage, which creates special risks. The use of leverage may increase the Fund’s exposure to long securities positions and\nmake any change in the Fund’s NAV greater than it would be without the use of leverage. This could result in increased\nwww.calamos.com 103\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 15\nCHKSUM Content: 14195 Layout: 57627 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nvolatility of returns. There is no guarantee that any leveraging strategy the Fund employs will be successful during any period\nin which it is employed.\nSynthetic Convertible Instruments Risk.The value of a synthetic convertible instrument may respond differently to market\nfluctuations than a convertible instrument because a synthetic convertible instrument is composed of two or more separate\nsecurities, each with its own market value. In addition, if the value of the underlying common stock or the level of the index\ninvolved in the convertible component falls below the exercise price of the warrant or option, the warrant or option may\nlose all value.Synthetic convertible instruments created by other parties have the same attributes of a convertible security;\nhowever, the issuer of the synthetic convertible instrument assumes the credit risk associated with the investment, rather\nthan the issuer of the underlying equity security into which the instrument is convertible. Investing in synthetic convertible\ninstruments also involves the risk that the Fund does not achieve the investment exposure desired by Calamos. The Fund\nremains subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument.\nTax Risk.The Fund may invest in certain securities, such as certain convertible securities and high yield securities, for which\nthe federal income tax treatment may not be clear or may be subject to re-characterization by the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”). It could be more difficult for the Fund to comply with certain federal income tax requirements applicable to regulated\ninvestment companies if the tax characterization of the Fund’s investments is not clear or if the tax treatment of the income\nfrom such investments was successfully challenged by the IRS. In addition, the tax treatment of the Fund may be affected by\nfuture interpretations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and changes in the tax laws and regulations, all\nof which may apply with retroactive effect.\nUS Government Security Risk. Some securities issued by US Government agencies or government sponsored enterprises\nare not backed by the full faith and credit of the US and may only be supported by the right of the agency or enterprise to\nborrow from the US Treasury. There can be no assurance that the US Government will always provide financial support to\nthose agencies or enterprises.\nVolatility Risk. Risk may arise in connection with the use of derivative instruments from volatility of interest rates and the\nprices of reference instruments.\nFund Level and Other Risks\nCurrency Risk.To the extent that the Fund invests in securities or other instruments denominated in or indexed to foreign\ncurrencies, changes in currency exchange rates bring an added dimension of risk. Currency fluctuations could negatively\nimpact investment gains or add to investment losses. Although the Fund may attempt to hedge against currency risk, the\nhedging instruments may not always perform as the Fund expects and could produce losses. Suitable hedging instruments\nmay not be available for currencies of emerging market countries. The Fund’s investment adviser may determine not to\nhedge currency risks, even if suitable instruments appear to be available.\nCybersecurity Risk. Investment companies, such as the Fund, and their service providers are exposed to operational and\ninformation security risks resulting from cyberattacks, which may result in financial losses to a fund and its shareholders.\nCyber-attacks include, among other behaviors, stealing or corrupting data maintained online or digitally, denial of service\nattacks on websites, “ransomware” that renders systems inoperable until ransom is paid, the unauthorized release of\nconfidential information, or various other forms of cybersecurity breaches. Cyber-attacks affecting the Fund or the Adviser,\ncustodian, transfer agent, distributor, administrator, intermediaries, trading counterparties, and other third-party service\nproviders may adversely impact the Fund or the companies in which the Fund invests, causing the Fund’s investments to lose\nvalue or to prevent a shareholder redemption or purchase from clearing in a timely manner.\nInflation Risk.Inflation is the reduction in the purchasing power of money resulting from an increase in the price of goods\nand services. Inflation risk is the risk that the inflation adjusted or “real” value of an investment in preferred stock or debt\nsecurities or the income from that investment will be worth less in the future. As inflation occurs, the real value of the\npreferred stock or debt securities and the dividend payable to holders of preferred stock or interest payable to holders of\ndebt securities declines.\nLeverage Risk(for all Funds except CPZ).The Fund has issued indebtedness and preferred shares and may borrow money\nor issue debt securities as permitted by the 1940 Act. As of October 31, 2023, the Fund has leverage in the form of\nborrowings under the SSBAgreement and outstanding MRP Shares.

As a non-fundamental policy, the Fund may\nnot issue preferred shares or borrow money and/or issue debt securities with an aggregate liquidation preference and\naggregate principal amount exceeding 38% of the Fund’s managed assets as measured at the time of borrowing or issuance\nof the new securities. However, the Board of Trustees reserves the right to issue preferred shares or debt securities or borrow\nto the extent permitted by the 1940Act and the Fund’s policies.\nLeverage creates risks which may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:\n• the likelihood of greater volatility in the NAV and market price of the Fund’s common shares;\n• fluctuations in the dividend rates on any preferred shares borne by the Fund or in interest rates on borrowings and short-\nterm debt;\n• increased operating costs, which are effectively borne by common shareholders, may reduce the Fund’s total return; and\n• the potential for a decline in the value of an investment acquired with borrowed funds, while the Fund’s obligations under\nsuch borrowing or preferred shares remain fixed.\nIn addition, the rights of lenders and the holders of preferred shares and debt securities issued by the Fund will be senior to\nthe rights of the holders of common shares with respect to the payment of dividends or to the payment of assets upon\nliquidation. Holders of preferred shares have voting rights in addition to and separate from the voting rights of common\nshareholders. The holders of preferred shares or debt, if any, on the one hand, and the holders of the common shares, on\nthe other, may have interests that conflict in certain situations.\nLeverage is a speculative technique that could adversely affect the returns to common shareholders. Leverage can cause the\nFund to lose money and can magnify the effect of any losses. To the extent the income or capital appreciation derived from\nsecurities purchased with funds received from leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund’s return will be greater than\nif leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income or capital appreciation from the securities purchased with such\nfunds is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage or if the Fund incurs capital losses, the return of the Fund will be less\nthan if leverage had not been used, and therefore the amount available for distribution to common shareholders as dividends\nand other distributions will be reduced or potentially eliminated.\nThe Fund will pay, and common shareholders will effectively bear, any costs and expenses relating to any borrowings and to\nthe issuance and ongoing maintenance of preferred shares or debt securities. Such costs and expenses include the higher\nmanagement fee resulting from the use of any such leverage, offering and/or issuance costs, and interest and/or dividend\nexpense and ongoing maintenance. These conditions may, directly or indirectly, result in higher leverage costs to common\nshareholders.\nCertain types of borrowings may result in the Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements, including those relating\nto asset coverage, borrowing base and portfolio composition requirements and additional covenants that may affect the\nFund’s ability to pay dividends and distributions on common shares in certain instances. The Fund may also be required to\npledge its assets to the lenders in connection with certain types of borrowings. The Fund may be subject to certain restrictions\non investments imposed by guidelines of and covenants with rating agencies which may issue ratings for the preferred shares\nor short-term debt instruments issued by the Fund. These guidelines and covenants may impose asset coverage or portfolio\ncomposition requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the 1940Act. The Board of Trustees reserves the\nright to change the amount and type of leverage that the Fund uses, and reserves the right to implement changes to the\nFund’s borrowings that it believes are in the long-term interests of the Fund and its shareholders, even if such changes impose\na higher interest rate or other costs or impacts over the intermediate, or short-term time period. There is no guarantee that\nthe Fund will maintain leverage at the current rate, and the Board of Trustees reserves the right to raise, decrease, or eliminate\nthe Fund’s leverage exposure.\nIf the Fund’s ability to make dividends and distributions on its common shares is limited, such limitation could, under certain\ncircumstances, impair the ability of the Fund to maintain its qualification for taxation as a regulated investment company or\nto reduce or eliminate tax at the Fund level, which would have adverse tax consequences for common shareholders. To the\nextent that the Fund is required, in connection with maintaining 1940 Act asset coverage requirements or otherwise, or\nelects to redeem any preferred shares or debt securities or prepay any borrowings, the Fund may need to liquidate investments\nto fund such redemptions or prepayments. Liquidation at times of adverse economic conditions may result in capital loss\nand reduce returns to common shareholders.\nwww.calamos.com 105\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 17\nCHKSUM Content: 46859 Layout: 57627 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nBecause Calamos’ investment management fee is a percentage of the Fund’s managed assets, Calamos’ fee will be higher\nif the Fund is leveraged and Calamos will have an incentive to be more aggressive and leverage the Fund. Consequently, the\nFund and Calamos may have differing interests in determining whether to leverage the Fund’s assets. Any additional use of\nleverage by the Fund effected through new, additional or increased credit facilities or the issuance of preferred shares would\nrequire approval by the Board. In considering whether to approve the use of additional leverage, the Board would be\npresented with all relevant information necessary to make a determination whether or not additional leverage through those\nmeans would be in the best interests of the Fund, including information regarding any potential conflicts of interest.\nLeverage Risk (CPZ). The Fund anticipates that it will issue indebtedness and may issue preferred shares or borrow money\nor issue debt securities as permitted by the 1940 Act. As of October 31, 2023, the Fund has leverage in the form of\nborrowings under the SSB Agreement. Leverage is the potential for the Fund to participate in gains and losses on an amount\nthat exceeds the Fund’s investment. The borrowing of money or issuance of debt securities and preferred shares represents\nthe leveraging of the Fund’s common shares. As a non-fundamental policy, the Fund may not issue preferred shares or borrow\nmoney and issue debt securities with an aggregate liquidation preference and aggregate principal amount exceeding 38%\nof the Fund’s total assets. However, the Board reserves the right to issue preferred shares or borrow to the extent permitted\nby the 1940Act and the Fund’s policies. Investments of short sale proceeds and economic leverage through derivatives are\nnot counted as borrowings.\nLeverage creates risks which may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:\n• the likelihood of greater volatility in the NAV and market price of the Fund’s common shares;\n• fluctuations in the interest rates on borrowings and short-term debt;\n• increased operating costs, which are effectively borne by common shareholders, may reduce the Fund’s total return; and\n• the potential for a decline in the value of an investment acquired with borrowed funds, while the Fund’s obligations under\nsuch borrowing remain fixed.\nThe Fund’s use of leverage is premised upon the expectation that the Fund’s preferred share dividends or borrowing cost will\nbe lower than the return the Fund achieves on its investments with the proceeds of the issuance of senior securities or\nborrowing. Such difference in return may result from the Fund’s higher credit rating or the short-term nature of its borrowing\ncompared to the lower credit quality, long-term nature of its investments. Because Calamos seeks to invest the Fund’s\nmanaged assets (including the assets obtained from leverage) in a portfolio of potentially higher yielding investments or\nportfolio investments with the potential for capital appreciation, the holders of common shares will be the beneficiaries of\nthe incremental return but will bear the risk of loss on investments made with the leverage proceeds. Should the differential\nbetween the Fund’s return on investments made with the proceeds of leverage and the cost of the leverage narrow, the\nincremental return “pick up” will be reduced or the Fund may incur losses. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise\nwithout a corresponding increase in the yield on the Fund’s portfolio investments or the Fund otherwise incurs losses on its\ninvestments, the Fund’s NAV attributable to its common shares will reflect the decline in the value of portfolio holdings\nresulting therefrom.\nLeverage is a speculative technique that could adversely affect the returns to holders of common shares. Leverage can cause\nthe Fund to lose money and can magnify the effect of any losses. To the extent the income or capital appreciation derived\nfrom securities purchased with funds received from leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund’s return will be greater\nthan if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income or capital appreciation from the securities purchased with such\nfunds is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage or if the Fund incurs capital losses, the return of the Fund will be less\nthan if leverage had not been used, and therefore the amount available for distribution to common shareholders as dividends\nand other distributions will be reduced or potentially eliminated.\nThe Fund will pay, and common shareholders will effectively bear, any costs and expenses relating to any borrowings and to\nthe issuance and ongoing maintenance of debt. Such costs and expenses include the higher management fee resulting from\nthe use of any such leverage, offering and/or issuance costs, and interest expense and ongoing maintenance. These conditions\nmay, directly or indirectly, result in higher leverage costs to common shareholders.\nCertain types of borrowings may result in the Fund being subject to covenants in credit agreements, including those relating\nto asset coverage, borrowing base and portfolio composition requirements and additional covenants that may affect the\nFund’s ability to pay dividends and distributions on common shares in certain instances. The Fund may also be required to\n106 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 18\nCHKSUM Content: 28518 Layout: 35585 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\npledge its assets to the lenders in connection with certain types of borrowings. The Fund may be subject to certain restrictions\non investments imposed by guidelines of rating agencies which may issue ratings for the short-term debt instruments issued\nby the Fund. These guidelines may impose asset coverage or portfolio composition requirements that are more stringent\nthan those imposed by the 1940Act.\nIf the Fund’s ability to make dividends and distributions on its common shares is limited, such limitation could, under certain\ncircumstances, impair the ability of the Fund to maintain its qualification for taxation as a regulated investment company or\nto reduce or eliminate tax at the Fund level, which would have adverse tax consequences for common shareholders. To the\nextent that the Fund is required, in connection with maintaining 1940 Act asset coverage requirements or otherwise, or\nelects to redeem any senior securities or prepay any borrowings, the Fund may need to liquidate investments to fund such\nredemptions or prepayments. Liquidation at times of adverse economic conditions may result in capital loss and reduce\nreturns to common shareholders.\nBecause Calamos’ investment management fee is a percentage of the Fund’s managed assets, Calamos’ fee will be higher\nif the Fund is leveraged and Calamos will have an incentive to be more aggressive and leverage the Fund. Consequently, the\nFund and Calamos may have differing interests in determining whether to leverage the Fund’s assets. Any additional use of\nleverage by the Fund would require approval by the Board. In considering whether to approve the use of additional leverage,\nthe Board would be presented with all relevant information necessary to make a determination whether or not additional\nleverage would be in the best interests of the Fund, including information regarding any potential conflicts of interest.\nLimited Term Risk. Unless the limited term provision of the Fund’s Declaration of Trust is amended by shareholders in\naccordance with the Declaration of Trust, or unless the Fund completes the Eligible Tender Offer and converts to perpetual\nexistence, the Fund will dissolve on the Dissolution Date. The Fund is not a so called “target date” or “life cycle” fund whose\nasset allocation becomes more conservative over time as its target date, often associated with retirement, approaches. In\naddition, the Fund is not a “target term” fund whose investment objective is to return its original NAV on the Dissolution\nDate. The Fund’s investment objective and policies are not designed to seek to return to investors that purchase Shares in\nthis offering their initial investment of $20.00 per Share on the Dissolution Date or in the Eligible Tender Offer, and such\ninvestors and investors that purchase Shares after the completion of this offering may receive more or less than their original\ninvestment upon dissolution or in the Eligible Tender Offer.\nBecause the assets of the Fund will be liquidated in connection with the dissolution, the Fund will incur transaction costs in\nconnection with dispositions of portfolio securities. The Fund does not limit its investments to securities having a maturity\ndate prior to the Dissolution Date and may be required to sell portfolio securities when it otherwise would not, including at\ntimes when market conditions are not favorable, which may cause the Fund to lose money. In particular, the Fund’s portfolio\nmay still have large exposures to illiquid securities as the Dissolution Date approaches, and losses due to portfolio liquidation\nmay be significant. During the winddown period, beginning one year before the Dissolution Date, the Fund may begin\nliquidating all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio, and may deviate from its investment policies and may not achieve its\ninvestment objective. During the wind-down period, the Fund’s portfolio composition may change as more of its portfolio\nholdings are called or sold and portfolio holdings are disposed of in anticipation of dissolution. The disposition of portfolio\ninvestments by the Fund could cause market prices of such instruments, and hence the NAV and market price of the Shares,\nto decline. In addition, disposition of portfolio investments will cause the Fund to incur increased brokerage and related\ntransaction expenses. The Fund may receive proceeds from the disposition of portfolio investments that are less than the\nvaluations of such investments by the Fund. Rather than reinvesting the proceeds of matured, called or sold securities, the\nFund may invest such proceeds in short term or other lower yielding securities or hold the proceeds in cash, which may\nadversely affect its performance and the market price of the Shares. The Fund may distribute the proceeds in one or more\nliquidating distributions prior to the final liquidation, which may cause fixed expenses to increase when expressed as a\npercentage of assets under management. Upon dissolution, it is anticipated that the Fund will have distributed substantially\nall of its net assets to Shareholders, although securities for which no market exists or securities trading at depressed prices,\nif any, may be placed in a liquidating trust. Shareholders will bear the costs associated with establishing and maintaining a\nliquidating trust, if necessary. Securities placed in a liquidating trust may be held for an indefinite period of time until they\ncan be sold or pay out all of their cash flows. The Fund cannot predict the amount, if any, of securities that will be required\nto be placed in a liquidating trust. If the Fund conducts the Eligible Tender Offer, the Fund anticipates that funds to pay the\naggregate purchase price of Shares accepted for purchase pursuant to the tender offer will be first derived from any cash on\nhand and then from the proceeds from the sale of portfolio investments held by the Fund. In addition, the Fund may be\nrequired to dispose of portfolio investments in connection with any reduction in the Fund’s outstanding leverage necessary\nin order to maintain the Fund’s desired leverage ratios following a tender offer.

It is likely that during the pendency of a tender offer, and possibly for a time thereafter, the\nFund will hold a greater than normal percentage of its total assets in cash and cash equivalents, which may impede theFund’s\nability to achieve its investment objective and decrease returns to Shareholders. If the Fund’s tax basis for the investments\nsold is less than the sale proceeds, the Fund will recognize capital gains, which the Fund will generally distribute to\nShareholders. In addition, the Fund’s purchase of tendered Shares pursuant to a tender offer will have tax consequences for\ntendering Shareholders and may have tax consequences for non-tendering Shareholders. The purchase of Shares by the\nFund pursuant to a tender offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the Fund of non-tendering\nShareholders. All Shareholders remaining after a tender offer will be subject to proportionately higher expenses due to the\nreduction in the Fund’s total assets resulting from payment for the tendered Shares. Such reduction in the Fund’s total assets\nmay also result in less investment flexibility, reduced diversification and greater volatility for the Fund, and may have an\nadverse effect on the Fund’s investment performance. The Fund is not required to conduct the Eligible Tender Offer. If the\nFund conducts the Eligible Tender Offer, there can be no assurance that the number of tendered Shares would not result in\nthe Fund’s net assets totaling less than the Dissolution Threshold, in which case the Eligible Tender Offer will be terminated,\nno Shares will be repurchased pursuant to the Eligible Tender Offer and the Fund will dissolve on the Dissolution Date (subject\nto possible extensions). Following the completion of the Eligible Tender Offer in which the number of tendered Shares would\nresult in the Fund’s net assets totaling greater than the Dissolution Threshold, the Board may eliminate the Dissolution Date\nupon the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board and without a Shareholder vote. Thereafter, the Fund will have a\nperpetual existence. The Adviser may have a conflict of interest in recommending to the Board that the Dissolution Date be\neliminated and the Fund have a perpetual existence. The Fund is not required to conduct additional tender offers following\nthe Eligible Tender Offer and conversion to perpetual existence. Therefore, remaining Shareholders may not have another\nopportunity to participate in a tender offer. Shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a\ndiscount from their NAV, and as a result remaining Shareholders may only be able to sell their Shares at a discount to NAV.\nLoan Risk.The Fund may invest in loans which may not be (i)rated at the time of investment, (ii)registered with the SEC or\n(iii)listed on a securities exchange. There may not be as much public information available regarding these loans as is available\nfor other Fund investments, such as exchange-listed securities. As well, there may not be an active trading market for some\nloans, meaning they may be illiquid and more difficult to value than other more liquid securities. Settlement periods for loans\nare longer than for exchange traded securities, typically ranging between 1 and 3 weeks, and in some cases much longer.\nThere is no central clearinghouse for loan trades, and the loan market has not established enforceable settlement standards\nor remedies for failure to settle. Because the interest rates of floating-rate loans in which the Fund may invest may reset\nfrequently, if market interest rates fall, the loans’ interest rates will be reset to lower levels, potentially reducing the Fund’s\nincome. Because the adviser may wish to invest in the publicly traded securities of an obligor, the Fund may not have access\nto material non-public information regarding the obligor to which other investors have access\nMarket Discount Risk. The Fund’s common shares have traded both at a premium and at a discount relative to NAV.\nCommon shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount from NAV, but in some cases trade\nabove NAV. The risk of the Fund’s common shares trading at a discount is a risk separate from the risk of a decline in the\nFund’s NAV as a result of investment activities. The Fund’s NAV may be reduced immediately following an offering by the\noffering costs for common shares or other securities, which will be borne entirely by all common shareholders. The Fund’s\ncommon shares are designed primarily for long-term investors, and you should not purchase common shares if you intend\nto sell them shortly after purchase. Whether shareholders will realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the Fund’s common\nshares depends upon whether the market value of the shares at the time of sale is above or below the price the shareholder\npaid, taking into account transaction costs for the shares, and is not directly dependent upon the Fund’s NAV. Because the\nmarket value of the Fund’s common shares will be determined by factors such as the relative demand for and supply of the\nshares in the market, general market conditions and other factors beyond the control of the Fund, the Fund cannot predict\nwhether its common shares will trade at, below or above the Fund’s NAV, or below or above the public offering price for the\ncommon shares.\nMarket Disruption Risk. Certain events have a disruptive effect on the securities markets, such as terrorist attacks, war\nand other geopolitical events, earthquakes, storms and other disasters. The Fund cannot predict the effects of similar events\nin the future on the US economy or any foreign economy.\nMarket Impact Risk. The sale of the Fund’s common shares (or the perception that such sales may occur) may have an\nadverse effect on prices in the secondary market for the Fund’s common shares. An increase in the number of common\nshares available may put downward pressure on the market price for the Fund’s common shares. These sales also might\n108 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:06 | 23-28873-8.cm | Sequence: 20\nCHKSUM Content: 12538 Layout: 60302 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nPrincipal Risks of the Funds\nmake it more difficult for the Fund to sell additional equity securities in the future at a time and price the Fund deems\nappropriate.\nRatings and Asset Coverage Risk.To the extent that senior securities are rated, a rating does not eliminate or necessarily\nmitigate the risks of investing in the Fund’s senior securities, and a rating may not fully or accurately reflect all of the credit\nand market risks associated with that senior security. A rating agency could downgrade the rating of the Fund’s shares of\npreferred stock or debt securities, which may make such securities less liquid in the secondary market, though potentially\nwith higher resulting interest rates. If a rating agency downgrades the rating assigned to a senior security, the Fund may\nalter its portfolio or redeem the senior security. The Fund may voluntarily redeem senior securities under certain circumstances\nReduction of Leverage Risk. A Fund may take action to reduce the amount of leverage it employs. Reduction of the\nleverage employed by the Fund, including by redemption of preferred shares(if applicable), will in turn reduce the amount\nof assets available for investment in portfolio securities. This reduction in leverage may negatively impact the Fund’s financial\nperformance, including the Fund’s ability to sustain current levels of distributions on common shares.\nThe Board reserves the right to change the amount and type of leverage that the Fund uses, and reserves the right to\nimplement changes to the Fund’s borrowings that it believes are in the best long-term interests of the Fund and its\nshareholders, even if such changes impose a higher interest rate or other costs or impacts over the intermediate, or short-\nterm time period. There is no guarantee that the Fund will maintain leverage at the current rate, and the Board reserves the\nright to raise, decrease, or eliminate the Fund’s leverage exposure.\nRegulatory Risk. The enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions may depend on compliance with\napplicable statutory and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable\ninternational requirements. New or amended regulations may be imposed by the CFTC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve or\nother financial regulators, other governmental regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the\nfinancial markets that could adversely affect the Fund. In particular, these agencies are empowered to promulgate a variety\nof new rules pursuant to recently enacted financial reform legislation in the United States. The Fund also may be adversely\naffected by changes in the enforcement or interpretation of existing statues and rules by these governmental regulatory\nauthorities or self-regulatory organizations. In addition, the securities and futures markets are subject to comprehensive\nstatutes, regulations and margin requirements. For instance, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection\nAct (“Dodd-Frank Act”) could have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to use derivative instruments. The Dodd-Frank Act\nis designed to impose stringent regulation on the over-the-counter derivatives market in an attempt to increase transparency\nand accountability and provides for, among other things, new clearing, execution, margin, reporting, recordkeeping, business\nconduct, disclosure, position limit, minimum net capital and registration requirements. Although the CFTC has released final\nrules relating to clearing, execution, reporting, risk management, compliance, position limit, anti-fraud, consumer protection,\nportfolio reconciliation, documentation, recordkeeping, business conduct, margin requirements and registration requirements\nunder the Dodd-Frank Act, many of the provisions are subject to further final rulemaking, and thus the Dodd-Frank Act’s\nultimate impact remains unclear. New regulations could, among other things, restrict the Fund’s ability to engage in derivatives\ntransactions (for example, by making certain types of derivatives transactions no longer available to our funds), increase the\ncosts of using these instruments (for example, by increasing margin, capital or reporting requirements) and/or make them\nless effective and, as a result, the Fund may be unable to execute its investment strategy. Limits or restrictions applicable to\nthe counterparties with which the Fund engages in derivative transactions could also prevent the Fund from using these\ninstruments, affect the pricing or other factors relating to these instruments or may change availability of certain investments.\nIt is unclear how the regulatory changes will affect counterparty risk.\nSecondary Market Risk.The market value of exchange-listed preferred shares that the Fund may issue will be determined\nby factors such as the relative demand for and supply of the preferred shares in the market, general market conditions and\nother factors beyond the control of the Fund. It may be difficult to predict the trading patterns of preferred shares, including\nthe effective costs of trading. There is a risk that the market for preferred shares may be thinly traded and relatively illiquid\ncompared to the market for other types of securities.\nSenior Leverage Risk.Preferred shares will be junior in liquidation and with respect to distribution rights to debt securities\nand any other borrowings. Senior securities representing indebtedness may constitute a substantial lien and burden on\npreferred shares by reason of their prior claim against the Fund’s income and against the Fund’s net assets in liquidation.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and the Funds are each considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follow the accounting and reporting guidance applicable to investment companies. The Funds adhere\nto the accounting and reporting requirements set forthby the Financial Accounting Standards Boardin Accounting Standards\nCodification (ASC) Topic 946: Financial Services—Investment Companies. Under U.S. GAAP, management is required to make\ncertain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements and actual results may differ from those estimates.\nSubsequent events, if any, through the date that the financial statements were issued, have been evaluated in the preparation\nof the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Funds:\nFund Valuation.EachBoard of Trustees (“Board” or “Trustees”), including a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested\npersons” of each Fund, have designated Calamos Advisors LLC (“Calamos Advisors”, or the “Advisor”) to perform fair\nvaluation determinations related to all Funds’ investments under the oversight of the Board. As “valuation designee” Calamos\nAdvisors has adopted policies and procedures to guide the determination of the net asset value (“NAV”) on any day on\nwhich each Fund’s NAV is determined. The valuation of each Fund’s investments is in accordance with these procedures.\nFunds’securities that are traded on U.S. securities exchanges, except option securities, are valued at the official closing price,\nwhich is the last current reported sales price on its principal exchange at the time the Fund determines its NAV. Securities\ntraded in the over-the-counter market and quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market are valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing\nPrice, as determined by NASDAQ, or lacking a NASDAQ Official Closing Price, the last current reported sale price on NASDAQ\nat the time the Fund determines its NAV. When a last sale or closing price is not available, equity securities, other than option\nsecurities, that are traded on a U.S. securities exchange and other equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market\nare valued at the mean between the most recent bid and asked quotations on its principal exchange in accordance with\nguidelines adopted by the Board. Each option security traded on a U.S. securities exchange is valued at the mid-point of the\nconsolidated bid/ask quote for the option security, also in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Board of Trustees. Each\nover-the-counter option that is not traded through the Options Clearing Corporation is valued either by an independent\npricing agent approved by the Board or based on a quotation provided by the counterparty to such option under the ultimate\nsupervision of the Board.\nFixed income securities, bank loans, certain convertible preferred securities, and non-exchange traded derivatives are normally\nvalued by independent pricing services or by dealers or brokers who make markets in such securities. Valuations of such\nfixed income securities, bank loans, certain convertible preferred securities, and non-exchange traded derivatives consider\nyield or price of equivalent securities of comparable quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and\nother market data and do not rely exclusively upon exchange or over-the-counter prices.\nTrading on European and Far Eastern exchanges and over-the-counter markets is typically completed at various times before\nthe close of business on each day on which the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) is open. Each security trading on these\nexchanges or in over-the-counter markets may be valued utilizing a systematic fair valuation model provided by an\nindependent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees. The valuation of each security that meets certain criteria in\nrelation to the valuation model is systematically adjusted to reflect the impact of movement in the U.S. market after the\nforeign markets close. Securities that do not meet the criteria, or that are principally traded in other foreign markets, are\nvalued as of the last reported sale price at the timeeachFund determines its NAV, or when reliable market prices or quotations\nare not readily available, at the mean between the most recent bid and asked quotations as of the close of the appropriate\nexchange or other designated time. Trading of foreign securities may not take place on every NYSE business day. In addition,\ntrading may take place in various foreign markets on Saturdays or on other days when the NYSE is not open and on which\neachFund’s NAV is not calculated.\nIf the Advisor’s pricing committee determines that the valuation of a security in accordance with the methods described\nabove is not reflective of a fair value for such security, the security is valued at a fair value by the pricing committee.\nwww.calamos.com 239\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ga | Sequence: 2\nCHKSUM Content: 33321 Layout: 51032 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nNotes to Financial Statements\nThe Funds also may use fair value pricing, pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by Calamos Advisors, if trading in\nthe security is halted or if the value of a security it holds is materially affected by events occurring before a Fund’s pricing\ntime but after the close of the primary market or exchange on which the security is listed. Those procedures may utilize\nvaluations furnished by pricing services approved by Calamos Advisors, which may be based on market transactions for\ncomparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders, a\ncomputerized matrix system, or appraisals derived from information concerning the securities or similar securities received\nfrom recognized dealers in those securities.\nWhen fair value pricing of securities is employed, the prices of securities used by each Fund to calculate its NAV may differ\nfrom market quotations or official closing prices. There can be no assurance that each Fund could purchase or sell a portfolio\nsecurity at the price used to calculate each Fund’s NAV.\nVarious inputs are used to determine the value of each Fund’s investments. These inputs are categorized into three broad\nlevels as follows:\n• Level 1 – Prices are determined using inputs from unadjusted quoted prices from active markets (including securities\nactively traded on a securities exchange) for identical assets.\n• Level 2 – Prices are determined using significant observable market inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices,\nincluding quoted prices of similar securities, fair value adjustments to quoted foreign securities, interest rates, credit\nrisk, prepayment speeds, and other relevant data.\n• Level3– Prices reflect unobservable market inputs (including each Fund’s own judgments about assumptions market\nparticipants would use in determining fair value) when observable inputs are unavailable.\nDebt securities are valued based upon evaluated prices received from an independent pricing service or from a dealer or\nbroker who makes markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize various observable market data and as such, debt\nsecurities are generally categorized as Level 2. The levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity of each\nFund’s investments. The summary of the inputs used in valuing each Fund’s holdings are available after each Fund’sSchedule\nof Investments.\nInvestment Transactions.Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis as of October31, 2023. Net realized\ngains and losses from investment transactions are reported on an identified cost basis. Interest income is recognized using\nthe accrual method and includes accretion of original issue and market discount and amortization of premium. Dividend\nincome is recognized on the ex-dividend date, except that certain dividends from foreign securities are recorded as soon as\nthe information becomes available after the ex-dividend date.\nForeign Currency Translation.Values of investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using a rate quoted by a major bank or dealer in the particular currency market, as reported by\na recognized quotation dissemination service.\nThe Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on\ninvestments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included\nwith the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.\nReported net realized foreign currency gains or losses arise from disposition of foreign currency, the difference in the foreign\nexchange rates between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts\nof dividends, interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the ex-date or accrual date and the U.S. dollar equivalent\nof the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes (due to the\nchanges in the exchange rate) in the value of foreign currency and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies held at period end.\nAllocation of Expenses Among Funds.

The amount of dividends\nand distributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income\ntax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent these “book and tax”\ndifferences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal tax-\nbasis treatment. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, contingent\npayment debt instruments and methods of amortizing and accreting for fixed income securities. The financial statements\nare not adjusted for temporary differences.\nDistributions to holders of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares (“MRPS”) as described in Note8 are accrued on a daily\nbasis and are treated as an operating expense due to the fixed term of the obligation. The distributions are shown on the\nStatement of Operations as Interest expense and amortization of offering costs on MRPS. For tax purposes, the distributions\nmade to the holders of the MRPS are treated as dividends.\nThe Funds recognized no liability for uncertain tax positions. A reconciliation is not provided as the beginning and ending\namounts of unrecognized benefits are zero, with no interim additions, reductions or settlements. Tax years 2020 – 2022\nremain subject to examination by the U.S. and the State of Illinois tax jurisdictions.\nIndemnifications.Under the Funds’ organizational documents, each Fund is obligated to indemnify its officers and trustees\nagainst certain liabilities incurred by them by reason of having been an officer or trustee of the Fund. In addition, in the\nnormal course of business,aFund may enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other parties.AFund’s\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made againsta\nFund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Funds’ management expects the risk of material loss in connection to a\npotential claim to be remote.\nNote 2 – Investment Adviser and Transactions With Affiliates Or Certain Other Parties\nPursuant to an investment advisory agreement with Calamos Advisors, each Fund pays an annual fee, payable monthly based\non the average weekly managed assets of the Fund, as shown below:\nFUND ANNUAL RATE\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund 0.80%\nConvertible and High Income Fund 0.80%\nStrategic Total Return Fund 1.00%\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 1.00%\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 1.00%\nGlobal Total Return Fund 1.00%\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 1.35%\nEach Fund reimburses Calamos Advisors for a portion of compensation paid to each Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer. This\ncompensation is reported as part of the “Trustees’ fees and officer compensation” expense on the Funds’ Statements of\nOperations.\nThe Funds have adopted a deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, a trustee who is not an “interested\nperson” (as defined in the 1940Act) and has elected to participate in the Plan (a “participating trustee”) may defer receipt\nof all or a portion of his compensation from the Trust. The deferred compensation payable to the participating trustee is\ncredited to the trustee’s deferral account as of the business day such compensation would have been paid to the participating\ntrustee. The value of amounts deferred for a participating trustee is determined by reference to the change in value of ClassI\nshares of one or more funds of theCalamos Investment Trustdesignated by the participant. The value of the account increases\nwith contributions to the account or with increases in the value of the measuring shares, and the value of the account\ndecreases with withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the measuring shares.\nwww.calamos.com 241\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ga | Sequence: 4\nCHKSUM Content: 58496 Layout: 51032 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nNotes to Financial Statements\nAt October 31, 2023, the Funds had deferred compensation balances, which are included in “Other assets” on the\nStatements of Assets and Liabilities, as follows:\nFUND AMOUNT\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund $165,660\nConvertible and High Income Fund 142,968\nStrategic Total Return Fund 202,387\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 0\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 76,901\nGlobal Total Return Fund 48,868\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 0\nEach Fund’s obligation to make payments under the Plan is a general obligation of the Fund and is included in “Payable for\ndeferred compensation to trustees” on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities at October31, 2023.\nCalamos Long/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust recorded payment by affiliates in the amount of $1,223,984 for losses\nincurred on the disposal of investments that resulted due to the identification of an error during the year ended October31,\n2023.

Each Fund may sell a security it does not\nown in anticipation of a decline in the value of that security before the delivery date. When a Fund sells a security short, it\nmust borrow the security sold short and deliver it to the broker-dealer through which it made the short sale. Dividends paid\non securities sold short are disclosed as an expense on the Statements of Operations. A gain, limited to the price at which a\nFund sold the security short, or a loss, unlimited in size, will be realized upon the termination of a short sale.\nTo secure its obligation to deliver to the broker-dealer the securities sold short, a Fund must segregate an amount of cash or\nliquid securities with its custodian equal to any excess of the current market value of the securities sold short over any cash\nor liquid securities deposited as collateral with the broker in connection with the short sale (not including the proceeds of\nthe short sale). As a result of that requirement, a Fund will not gain any leverage merely by selling short, except to the extent\nthat it earns interest or other income or gains on the segregated cash or liquid securities while also being subject to the\npossibility of gain or loss from the securities sold short. Other Income on the Statement of Operations consists of income\nfrom interest on short sales of $6,494,633 during the year ended October 31, 2023.\nNote 6 – Derivative Instruments\nForeign Currency Risk.Each Fund may engage in portfolio hedging with respect to changes in currency exchange rates by\nentering into forward foreign currency contracts to purchase or sell currencies. A forward foreign currency contract is a\ncommitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. Risks associated with such\ncontracts include, among other things, movement in the value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar and the\nability of the counterparty to perform.\nTo mitigate the counterparty risk, a Fund may enter into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master\nAgreement (“ISDA Master Agreement”) or similar agreement with its derivative contract counterparties. An ISDA Master\nAgreement is a bilateral agreement between a Fund and a counterparty that governs over-the-counter derivatives and foreign\nexchange contracts and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event\nof a default and/or termination event. Under an ISDA Master Agreement, a Fund may, under certain circumstances, offset\nwith the counterparty certain derivative financial instrument’s payables and/or receivables with collateral held and/or posted\nand create one single net payment. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in\nthe event of default (close-out netting) including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. Generally, collateral is\nexchanged between a Fund and the counterparty and the amount of collateral due from a Fund or to a counterparty has to\nexceed a minimum transfer amount threshold before a transfer has to be made. To the extent amounts due to the Fund\nfrom its counterparties are not fully collateralized, contractually or otherwise, the Fund bears the risk of loss from counterparty\nnonperformance. When a Fund is required to post collateral under the terms of a derivatives transaction and master netting\nagreement, a Fund’s custodian holds the collateral in a segregated account, subject to the terms of a tri-party agreement\namong a Fund, the custodian and the counterparty. The master netting agreement and tri-party agreement provide, in\nrelevant part, that the counterparty may have rights to the amounts in the segregated account in the event that a Fund\ndefaults in its obligation with respect to the derivative instrument that is subject to the collateral requirement. When a\ncounterparty is required to post collateral under the terms of a derivatives transaction and master netting agreement, the\ncounterparty delivers such amount to a Fund’s custodian. The master netting agreement provides, in relevant part, that the\nFund may have rights to such collateral in the event that the counterparty defaults in its obligation with respect to the\n244 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ga | Sequence: 7\nCHKSUM Content: 43943 Layout: 42329 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nNotes to Financial Statements\nderivative instrument that is subject to the collateral requirement. Generally before a default, neither a Fund nor the\ncounterparty may resell, rehypothecate, or repledge any collateral that it receives.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Funds do not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to netting\narrangements in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Each Fund’s net counterparty exposure, if any, is reflected in the\nSchedules of Investments. The net unrealized gain, if any, represents the credit risk to the Fund on a forward foreign currency\ncontract. The contracts are valued daily at forward foreign exchange rates. The Fund realizes a gain or loss when a position\nis closed or upon settlement of the contracts. There were no open forward foreign currency contractsfor any of the Funds\nat October31, 2023.\nEquity Risk. Each Fund may engage in option transactions and in doing so achieves similar objectives to what it would\nachieve through the sale or purchase of individual securities. A call option, upon payment of a premium, gives the purchaser\nof the option the right to buy, and the seller of the option the obligation to sell, the underlying security, index or other\ninstrument at the exercise price. A put option gives the purchaser of the option, upon payment of a premium, the right to\nsell, and the seller the obligation to buy, the underlying security, index, or other instrument at the exercise price.\nTo seek to offset some of the risk of a potential decline in value of certain long positions, each Fund may also purchase put\noptions on individual securities, broad-based securities indexes or certain exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). Each Fund may\nalso seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options on a portion of the equity securities (including\nsecurities that are convertible into equity securities) in a Fund’s portfolio, on broad-based securities indexes, or certain ETFs.\nWhen a Fund purchases an option, it pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as an asset. When\na Fund writes an option, it receives a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as a liability. The asset or\nliability is adjusted daily to reflect the current market value of the option. If an option expires unexercised, a Fund realizes a\ngain or loss to the extent of the premium received or paid. If an option is exercised, the premium received or paid is recorded\nas an adjustment to the proceeds from the sale or the cost basis of the purchase. The difference between the premium and\nthe amount received or paid on a closing purchase or sale transaction is also treated as a realized gain or loss. The cost of\nsecurities acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The proceeds from securities sold\nthrough the exercise of put options are decreased by the premiums paid. Gain or loss on written options and purchased\noptions is presented separately on the Statements of Operations as net realized gain or loss on written options and net\nrealized gain or loss on purchased options, respectively.\nOptions written by each Fund do not typically give rise to counterparty credit risk since options written obligate each Fund\nand not the counterparty to perform. Exchange traded purchased options have minimal counterparty credit risk to each\nFund since the exchange’s clearinghouse, as counterparty to such instruments, guarantees against a possible default. As of\nOctober 31, 2023, the Funds had outstanding purchased options and/or written options as listed on the Schedules of\nInvestments.\nInterest Rate Risk. Each Fund may engage in interest rate swaps primarily to hedge the interest rate risk on the Fund’s\nborrowings (see Note7—Notes Payable). An interest rate swap is a contract that involves the exchange of one type of interest\nrate for another type of interest rate. If interest rates rise, resulting in a diminution in the value of the Fund’s portfolio, the\nFund would receive payments under the swap that would offset, in whole or in part, such diminution in value; if interest\nrates fall, the Fund would likely lose money on the swap transaction. Unrealized gains are reported as an asset, and unrealized\nlosses are reported as a liability on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value of swaps, including accruals\nof periodic amounts of interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as change in net unrealized\nappreciation/depreciation on interest rate swaps in the Statements of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded in net\nrealized gain (loss) on interest rate swaps in the Statements of Operations upon payment or receipt of a periodic payment\nor termination of the swap agreements. Swap agreements are stated at fair value. Notional principal amounts are used to\nexpress the extent of involvement in these transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much smaller.\nIn connection with these contracts, securities may be identified as collateral in accordance with the terms of the respective\nswap contracts in the event of default or bankruptcy of each Fund. Please see the disclosure regarding ISDA Master\nAgreements under Foreign Currency Risk within this note.\nPremiums paid to or by a Fund are accrued daily and included in realized gain (loss) when paid on swaps in the accompanying\nStatements of Operations. The contracts are marked-to-market daily based upon third party vendor valuations and changes\nin value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Gains or losses are realized upon early termination of the\ncontract. Risks may exceed amounts recognized in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These risks include changes in\nthe returns of the underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the contracts’ terms, counterparty’s\ncreditworthiness, and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the contracts.\nwww.calamos.com 245\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ga | Sequence: 8\nCHKSUM Content: 20012 Layout: 36831 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nNotes to Financial Statements\nAs of October31, 2023, the Funds had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements.\nAs of October31, 2023, the Funds had outstanding derivative contracts which are reflected on the Statement of Assets and\nLiabilities as follows:\nASSET LIABILITY\nDERIVATIVES DERIVATIVES\nCONVERTIBLE OPPORTUNITIES AND\nINCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $1,175,700 $ —\n$1,175,700 $ —\nCONVERTIBLE AND\nHIGH INCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $1,261,775 $ —\n$1,261,775 $ —\nASSET LIABILITY\nDERIVATIVES DERIVATIVES\nSTRATEGIC TOTAL RETURN FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $1,526,300 $ —\n$1,526,300 $ —\nDYNAMIC CONVERTIBLE AND\nINCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $1,037,475 $ —\n$1,037,475 $ —\nGLOBAL DYNAMIC INCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $1,573,636 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 160,840\n$1,573,636 $ 160,840\nGLOBAL TOTAL RETURN FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $ 324,467 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 35,365\n$ 324,467 $ 35,365\nLONG/SHORT EQUITY& DYNAMIC\nINCOME TRUST\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $3,105,465 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 3,965,683\n$3,105,465 $3,965,683\n246 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ga | Sequence: 9\nCHKSUM Content: 28241 Layout: 53153 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nNotes to Financial Statements\nFor the year ended October31, 2023, the volume of derivative activity for the Fundsarereflected below:*\nPURCHASED WRITTEN\nFUND OPTIONS(1) OPTIONS(2)\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund 1,753 —\nConvertible and High Income Fund 1,881 —\nStrategic Total Return Fund 67,203 11,360\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 1,534 —\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 38,769 5,648\nGlobal Total Return Fund 9,801 1,244\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 394,136 413,960\n* Activity during the period is measured by opened number of contracts for options purchased or written.\n(1) Generally, the Statement of Assets and Liabilities location for Purchased Options is “Investments in securities, at value”.\n(2) Generally, the Statement of Assets and Liabilities location for Written Options is “Options written, at value”.\nNote 7 – Notes Payable\nThe Funds have each entered into an Amended and Restated Liquidity Agreement (the “SSB Agreement”) with State Street\nBank and Trust Company (“SSB”) that allows each Fund to borrow up to a certain limit as shown in the table below, as well\nas engage in securities lending and securities repurchase transactions.\nBORROWING\nLIMIT\nFUND (IN MILLIONS)\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund $ 430.0\nConvertible and High Income Fund 480.0\nStrategic Total Return Fund 1,130.0\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 370.0\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 265.0\nGlobal Total Return Fund 55.0\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 150.0\nAdvancesunder the SSB Agreement are secured by assets of the Funds that are held with the Funds’ custodian in a separate\naccount (the “pledged collateral”).

Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Funds’ financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Funds in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Funds are not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an\naudit of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Funds’\ninternal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and\nfinancial highlights, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial\nhighlights. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included\nconfirmation of securities owned as of October31, 2023, by correspondence with custodians or counterparties; when replies\nwere not received, we performed other auditing procedures.

The “Independent Trustees,” who comprise more than 80% of the Board, have never been affiliated with the\nAdviser.\nIn connection with their most recent consideration regarding the continuation of the management agreements, the Trustees\nreceived and reviewed a substantial amount of information provided by the Adviser in response to detailed requests of the\nIndependent Trustees and their independent legal counsel. In the course of their consideration of each agreement, the\nIndependent Trustees were advised by their counsel, and in addition to meeting with management of the Adviser, they met\nseparately in executive session with their counsel.\nAt a meeting held on June21, 2023, based on their evaluation of the information referred to above and other information\nprovided in this and previous meetings, the Trustees determined that the overall arrangements between each Fund and the\nAdviser were fair in light of the nature, quality and extent of the services provided by the Adviser and its affiliates, the fees\ncharged for those services and other matters that the Trustees considered relevant in the exercise of their business judgment.\nAt that meeting, the Trustees, including all of the Independent Trustees, approved the continuation of the management\nagreement with respect to each Fund except Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund through July 31, 2024 and\nthrough September 30, 2024 with respect to Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund subject to possible earlier\ntermination as provided intheagreement.\nIn connection with its consideration of the management agreements, the Board considered, among other things: (i) the\nnature, quality and extent of the Adviser’s services, (ii) the investment performance of each Fund as well as performance\ninformation for comparable funds and other, comparable clients of the Adviser, (iii)the fees and other expenses paid byeach\nFund as well as expense information for comparable funds and for other, comparable clients of the Adviser, (iv)the profitability\nof the Adviser and its affiliates from their relationship with each Fund, (v) whether economies of scale may be realized as\neach Fund grows and whether potential economies may be shared, in some measure, with Fund investors and (vi) other\nbenefits to the Adviser from its relationship witheachFund. In the Board’s deliberations, no single factor was responsible for\ntheBoard’s decision to approve continuation of the management agreements, and each Trustee may have afforded different\nweight to the various factors.\nNature, Quality and Extent of Services.The Board’s consideration of the nature, quality and extent of the Adviser’s services\nto the Funds took into account the knowledge gained from the Board’s meetings with the Adviser throughout the years. In\naddition, the Board considered: the Adviser’s long-term history of managing each Fund; the consistency of investment\napproach; the background and experience of the Adviser’s investment personnel responsible for managing each Fund; and\nthe Adviser’s performance as administrator of the Funds, including, among other things, in the areas of brokerage selection,\ntrade execution, compliance and shareholder communications. The Board also reviewed the Adviser’s resources and key\npersonnel involved in providing investment management services to the Funds. The Board noted the personal investments\nthat the Adviser’s key investment personnel have made in each Fund, which further aligns the interests of the Adviser and\nits personnel with those ofeachFund’s shareholders. In addition, the Board considered compliance reports about the Adviser\nfrom the Funds’ Chief Compliance Officer.\nThe Board also considered the information provided by the Adviser regarding each Fund’s performance and the steps the\nAdviser is taking to improve performance. In particular, the Board noted the additional personnel added to the Adviser’s\ninvestment team, which includes portfolio managers, research analysts, research associates and risk management personnel.\nThe Board also noted the Adviser’s significant investment into its infrastructure and investment processes.\nInvestment Performance of the Funds.The Board considered each Fund’s investment performance over various time periods,\nincluding how the Fund performed compared to the average performance of a group of comparable funds (the Fund’s\n“Category”) selected by an independent third-party service provider. The performance periods considered by the Board\nended on March 31, 2023. Where available, the Board considered one-, three-, five- and ten-year performance.

The Board also considered that CGO\nranked in the 38thpercentile of its Category for the three-year period and in the 33rdpercentile of its Category for the ten-\nyear period.\nFor Calamos Long/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust (“CPZ”), the Board considered that CPZ outperformed its Category\naverage for the one-year period and underperformed its Category average for the year-to-date and three-year periods.\nCosts of Services Provided and Profits Realized by the Adviser. Using information provided by an independent third-party\nservice provider, the Board evaluated each Fund’s actual management fee rate compared to the median management fee\nrate for other closed-end funds similar in size, character and investment strategy (the Fund’s “Expense Group”), and the\nFund’s total expense ratio compared to the median total expense ratio of the Fund’s Expense Group.\nThe Board also reviewed the Adviser’s management fee rates for its institutional separate accounts, other advisory accounts\nand sub-advisory accounts with comparable investment strategies. The Board took into account that although, generally,\nthe rates of fees paid by institutional clients or for sub-advisory services were lower than the rates of fees paid by each Fund,\nthe differences reflected the Adviser’s greater level of responsibilities and significantly broader scope of services regarding\neach Fund, the more extensive regulatory obligations and risks associated with managing each Fund, and other financial\nconsiderations with respect to creation and sponsorship ofeachFund. The Board considered factors that led to more expenses\nfor registered funds including but not limited to: (i)capital expenditures to establish a fund, (ii)length of time to reach critical\nmass, and the related expenses, (iii) higher servicing costs of intermediaries and shareholders, (iv) higher redemption rates\nof assets under management, (v) entrepreneurial risk assumed by the Adviser and (vi) greater exposure to “make whole”\nerrors.\nThe Board also considered the Adviser’s costs in serving as each Fund’s investment adviser and manager, including but not\nlimited to costs associated with technology, infrastructure and compliance necessary to manage each Fund. The Board\nreviewed the Adviser’s methodology for allocating costs among the Adviser’s lines of business. The Board also considered\ninformation regarding the structure of the Adviser’s compensation program for portfolio managers, analysts and certain\nother employees, and the relationship of such compensation to the attraction and retention of quality personnel. Finally, the\nBoard reviewed information on the profitability of the Adviser in serving as the Funds’ investment manager and of the Adviser\nand its affiliates in all of their relationships with the Funds, as well as an explanation of the methodology utilized in allocating\nvarious expenses among the Funds and the Adviser’s other business units. Data was provided to the Board with respect to\nprofitability, both on a pre- and post-marketing cost basis. The Board reviewed the financial statements of the Adviser’s\nparent company and discussed its corporate structure. Further detail considered by the Board regarding the management\nfee rate and total expense ratio of each Fund is set forth below.\nFor CHI, the Board considered that although CHI’s management fee rate is higher than the median of the its Expense Group,\nits total expense ratio is equal to the median of its Expense Group. The Board reviewed CHI’s expenses in light of its\nperformance record.\nFor CHY, the Board considered that although CHY’s management fee rate is higher than the median of its Expense Group,\nits total expense ratio is lower than the median of its Expense Group.

The Board considered whether each Fund’s management fee shares with shareholders potential\neconomies of scale that may be achieved by the Adviser. The Board also considered the benefits accruing to shareholders\nfrom the Adviser’s investments into its infrastructure and investment processes.\nOther Benefits Derived from the Relationship with the Funds. The Board also considered other benefits that accrue to the\nAdviser and its affiliates from their relationship with the Funds. The Board concluded that while the Adviser may potentially\nbenefit from its relationship with the Funds in ways other than the fees payable by the Funds, the Funds also may benefit\nfromtheirrelationship with the Adviser in ways other than the services to be provided by the Adviser and its affiliates pursuant\nto their agreement with the Funds and the fees payable by each Fund.\nThe Board also considered the Adviser’s use of a portion of the commissions paid by the Funds ontheirportfolio brokerage\ntransactions to obtain research products and services benefiting the Funds and/or other clients of the Adviser and concluded,\nbased on reports from the Funds’ Chief Compliance Officer, that the Adviser’s use of “soft” commission dollars to obtain\nresearch products and services was consistent with regulatory requirements.\nAfter full consideration of the above factors as well as other factors that were instructive in their consideration, the Trustees,\nincluding all of the Independent Trustees, concluded that the continuation of the management agreement for each Fund\nwith the Adviser was in the best interest of each Fund and each Fund’s shareholders.\n270 CALAMOSCLOSED-ENDFAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ia | Sequence: 5\nCHKSUM Content: 34027 Layout: 27111 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nTrustees and Officers\n(Unaudited)\nThe management of each Fund, including general supervision of the duties performed for the Fund under the investment\nmanagement agreement between theFundand Calamos Advisors, is the responsibility of its board of trustees.

Shares of a closed-end fund are\nlisted on a stock exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market. Like all investment companies, a\nclosed-end fund is professionally managed and offers investors a unique investment solution based on\nits investment objective approved by the fund’s Board of Trustees.\nPotential Advantages of Closed-End Fund Investing\n• Defined Asset Pool Allows Efficient Portfolio Management—Although closed-end fund shares trade\nactively on a securities exchange, this doesn’t affect the closed-end fund manager because there are no new\ninvestors buying into or selling out of the fund’s portfolio.\n• More Flexibility in the Timing and Price of Trades—Investors can purchase and sell shares of closed-\nend funds throughout the trading day, just like the shares of other publicly traded securities.\n• Lower Expense Ratios—The expense ratios of closed-end funds are oftentimes less than those of mutual\nfunds. Over time, a lower expense ratio could enhance investment performance.\n• Closed-End Structure Makes Sense for Less-Liquid Asset Classes—A closed-end structure makes\nsense for investors considering less-liquid asset classes, such as high-yield bonds or micro-cap stocks.\n• Ability to Put Leverage to Work—Closed-end funds may issue senior securities (such as preferred shares\nor debentures) or borrow money to “leverage” their investment positions.\n• No Minimum Investment Requirements\nOPEN-END MUTUAL FUNDS VERSUS CLOSED-END FUNDS\nOPEN-END FUND CLOSED-END FUND\nIssues new shares on an ongoing basis Generally issues a fixed number of shares\nIssues common equity shares Can issue common equity shares and senior securities such\nas preferred shares and bonds\nSold at NAV plus any sales charge Price determined by the marketplace\nSold through the fund’s distributor Traded in the secondary market\nFund redeems shares at NAV calculated at the close of Fund does not redeem shares\nbusiness day\nYou can purchase or sell common shares of closed-end funds daily. Like any other stock, market price will\nfluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net\nasset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds\nfrequently trade at a discount, which is a market price that is below their net asset value.\nLeverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of\nnet asset value and market price of common shares and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage\nfinancing.\nEach open-end or closed-end fund should be evaluated individually. Before investing carefully consider\nthe fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.\n278 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ia | Sequence: 13\nCHKSUM Content: 4634 Layout: 8452 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nLevel Rate Distribution Policy\nUsing a LevelRate Distribution Policy to Promote Dependable Income and Total Return\nCalamos Global Total Return Fund and Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund have implemented a level\nrate distribution policy. The goal of the level rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable,\nthough not assured, level of cash flow, which can either serve as a stable income stream or, through\nreinvestment, may contribute significantly to long-term total return.\nWe understand the importance that investors place on the stability of dividends and their ability to\ncontribute to long-term total return, which is why we have instituted a level rate distribution policy for\nCalamos Global Total Return Fund andCalamos Global Dynamic Income Fund. Under the policy, monthly\ndistributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, and, if\nnecessary, return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include\nnet realized long-term capital gains. Please refer to each Fund’s financial statements for specific\ninformation about distributions made during the last fiscal year.\nThere is no guarantee that the Funds will realize capital gains in any given year. Distributions are subject\nto recharacterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. All shareholders with taxable\naccounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions\nvia Form 1099-DIV. For purposes of maintaining the level rate distribution policy, the Funds may realize\nshort-term capital gains on securities that, if sold at a later date, would have resulted in long-term capital\ngains. Maintenance of a level rate distribution policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated\nwith the Funds.\nDistributions from the Funds are generally subject to Federal income taxes.\nManaged Distribution Policy\nUsing a Managed Distribution Policy to Promote Dependable Income and Total Return\nCalamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund, Calamos Convertible and High Income Fund,\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund, Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund, and Calamos\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust have implemented a managed distribution policy. The goal of\nthe managed distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash\nflow, which can serve either as a stable income stream or, through reinvestment, may contribute\nsignificantly to long-term total return.\nWe understand the importance that investors place on the stability of dividends and their ability to\ncontribute to long-term total return, which is why we have instituted a managed distribution policy for\nCalamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund, Calamos Convertible and High Income Fund,\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund, Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund and Calamos\nLong/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust.Under the policy, monthly distributions paid may include net\ninvestment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and, if\nnecessary, return of capital.Please refer to each Fund’s financial statements for specific information about\ndistributions made during the last fiscal year.\nDistributions of capital decreasea Fund’stotal assets and total assets per share and, therefore, could have\nthe effect of increasinga Fund’sexpense ratio. In general, the policy of fixinga Fund’sdistributions at a\ntargeted rate does not affecta Fund’sinvestment strategy. However, in order to make these distributions,\non occasion theFundsmay have to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time.\nThere is no guarantee that theFundswill realize capital gains in any given year. Distributions are subject\nto re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. All shareholders with taxable\naccounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions\nvia Form 1099-DIV.\nDistributions from theFundsare generally subject to Federal income taxes.\nwww.calamos.com 279\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ia | Sequence: 14\nCHKSUM Content: 64426 Layout: 2567 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nAutomatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nMaximizing Investment with an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nThe Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan offers a simple, cost-efficient and convenient way to reinvest\nyour dividends and capital gains distributions in additional shares ofeachFund, allowing you to increase\nyour investment in the Fund.\nPotential Benefits\n• Compounded Growth: By automatically reinvesting with the Plan, you gain the potential to allow your\ndividends and capital gains to compound over time.\n• Potential for Lower Commission Costs: Additional shares are purchased in large blocks, with brokerage\ncommissions shared among all plan participants. There is no cost to enroll in the Plan.\n• Convenience: After enrollment, the Plan is automatic and includes detailed statements for participants.\nParticipants can terminate their enrollment at any time.\nPursuant to the Plan, unless a shareholder is ineligible or elects otherwise, all dividend and capital gains\non common shares distributions are automatically reinvested by Computershare, as agent for shareholders\nin administering the Plan (“Plan Agent”), in additional common shares of the Fund. Shareholders who\nelect not to participate in the Plan will receive all dividends and distributions payable in cash paid by check\nmailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name,\nthen to such nominee) by Plan Agent, as dividend paying agent. Shareholders may elect not to participate\nin the Plan and to receive all dividends and distributions in cash by sending written instructions to the\nPlan Agent, as dividend paying agent, at: Dividend Reinvestment Department, P.O.Box 43078, Providence\nRI 02940-3078. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at\nany time without penalty by giving notice in writing to the Plan Agent; such termination will be effective\nwith respect to a particular dividend or distribution if notice is received prior to the record date for the\napplicable distribution.\nThe shares are acquired by the Plan Agent for the participant’s account either (i) through receipt of\nadditional common shares from the Fund (“newly issued shares”) or (ii) by purchase of outstanding\ncommon shares on the open market (“open-market purchases”) on the NASDAQ or elsewhere. If, on\nthe payment date, the net asset value per share of the common shares is equal to or less than the market\nprice per common share plus estimated brokerage commissions (a “market premium”), the Plan Agent\nwill receive newly issued shares from the Fund for each participant’s account. The number of newly issued\ncommon shares to be credited to the participant’s account will be determined by dividing the dollar\namount of the dividend or distribution by the greater of (i)the net asset value per common share on the\npayment date, or (ii) 95% of the market price per common share on the payment date.\nIf, on the payment date, the net asset value per common share exceeds the market price plus estimated\nbrokerage commissions (a “market discount”), the Plan Agent has a limited period of time to invest the\ndividend or distribution amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. If, before the Plan Agent\nhas completed its open-market purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions exceeds\nthe net asset value of the common shares as of the payment date, the purchase price paid by Plan Agent\nmay exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer common shares\nthan if such dividend or distribution had been paid in common shares issued by the Fund. The weighted\naverage price (including brokerage commissions) of all common shares purchased by the Plan Agent as\nPlan Agent will be the price per common share allocable to each participant. If the Plan Agent is unable to\ninvest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the purchase period or if the market\ndiscount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-\nmarket purchases and will invest the uninvested portion of the dividend or distribution amount in newly\nissued shares at the net asset value per common share at the close of business on the last purchase date.\nThe automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve participants of any federal,\nstate or local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends even though\nno cash is received by participants.\n280 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ia | Sequence: 15\nCHKSUM Content: 59128 Layout: 63948 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nAutomatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nThere are no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of dividends\nor distributions payable either in shares or in cash.

The DSTA Control Share\nStatute became automatically applicable to the Funds on August1, 2022.\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute defines “control beneficial interests” (referred to as “control shares”\nherein) by reference to a series of voting power thresholds and provides that a holder of control shares\nacquired in a control share acquisition has no voting rights under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (DSTA)\nor each Fund’s Governing Documents (as used herein, “Governing Documents” means each Fund’s\nAgreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,\nincluding any Statement of Preferences establishing a series of preferred shares, as applicable) with respect\nto the control shares acquired in the control share acquisition, except to the extent approved by a Fund’s\nshareholders by the affirmative vote of two—thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter,\nexcluding all interested shares (generally, shares held by the acquiring person and their associates and\nshares held by Fund insiders).\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute provides for a series of voting power thresholds above which shares are\nconsidered control shares. Whether one of these thresholds of voting power is met is determined by\nwww.calamos.com 281\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ia | Sequence: 16\nCHKSUM Content: 6992 Layout: 43417 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nAdditional Fund Information: Delaware Statutory Trust Act – Control Share Acquisitions\naggregating the holdings of the acquiring person as well as those of his, her or its “associates.” These\nthresholds are:\n• 10% or more, but less than 15% of all voting power;\n• 15% or more, but less than 20% of all voting power;\n• 20% or more, but less than 25% of all voting power;\n• 25% or more, but less than 30% of all voting power;\n• 30% or more, but less than a majority of all voting power; or\n• a majority or more of all voting power.\nUnder the DSTA Control Share Statute, once a threshold is reached, an acquirer has no voting rights with\nrespect to shares in excess of that threshold (i.e., the “control shares”) until approved by a vote of\nshareholders, as described above, or otherwise exempted by the Funds’ Board of Trustees. The DSTA\nControl Share Statute contains a statutory process for an acquiring person to request a shareholder\nmeeting for the purpose of considering the voting rights to be accorded control shares. An acquiring\nperson must repeat this process at each threshold level.\nUnder the DSTA Control Share Statute, an acquiring person’s “associates” are broadly defined to include,\namong others, relatives of the acquiring person, anyone in a control relationship with the acquiring person,\nany investment fund or other collective investment vehicle that has the same investment adviser as the\nacquiring person, any investment adviser of an acquiring person that is an investment fund or other\ncollective investment vehicle and any other person acting or intending to act jointly or in concert with\nthe acquiring person.\nVoting power under the DSTA Control Share Statute is the power (whether such power is direct or indirect\nor through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise) to directly or indirectly\nexercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of a Fund in the election of each Fund’s\nTrustees (either generally or with respect to any subset, series or class of trustees, including any Trustees\nelected solely by a particular series or class of shares, such as the preferred shares). Thus, a Fund’s preferred\nshares, as applicable, acquired in excess of the above thresholds would be considered control shares with\nrespect to the preferred share class vote for two Trustees.\nAny control shares of the Fund acquired before August1, 2022 are not subject to the DSTA Control Share\nStatute; however, any further acquisitions on or after August1, 2022 are considered control shares subject\nto the DSTA Control Share Statute.\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute requires shareholders to disclose to a Fund any control share acquisition\nwithin 10 days of such acquisition, and also permits the Fund to require a shareholder or an associate of\nsuch person to disclose the number of shares owned or with respect to which such person or an associate\nthereof can directly or indirectly exercise voting power. Further, the DSTA Control Share Statute requires\na shareholder or an associate of such person to provide to the Fund within 10 days of receiving a request\ntherefor from the Fund any information that the Fund’s Trustees reasonably believe is necessary or desirable\nto determine whether a control share acquisition has occurred.\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute permits the Funds’ Board of Trustees, through a provision in each Fund’s\nGoverning Documents or by Board action alone, to eliminate the application of the DSTA Control Share\nStatute to the acquisition of control shares in the Fund specifically, generally, or generally by types, as to\nspecifically identified or unidentified existing or future beneficial owners or their affiliates or associates or\nas to any series or classes of shares. The DSTA Control Share Statute does not provide that the Fund can\ngenerally “opt out” of the application of the DSTA Control Share Statute; rather, specific acquisitions or\nclasses of acquisitions may be exempted by the Board of Trustees, either in advance or retroactively, but\nother aspects of the DSTA Control Share Statute, which are summarized above, would continue to apply.\n282 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS ANNUAL REPORT\nJOB: 23-28873-8 CYCLE#;BL#: 19; 0 TRIM: 8.25\" x 10.75\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Combined Closed End Fund Annual Report [Funds] 10-31-2023 ED [AUX] | 105568 | 22-Dec-23 13:07 | 23-28873-8.ia | Sequence: 17\nCHKSUM Content: 2131 Layout: 47140 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nAdditional Fund Information: Delaware Statutory Trust Act – Control Share Acquisitions\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute further provides that the Board of Trustees is under no obligation to\ngrant any such exemptions.\nThe foregoing is only a summary of the material terms of the DSTA Control Share Statute.

The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and the Funds are each considered an investment company\nunder U.S. GAAP and follow the accounting and reporting guidanceset forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board\nin Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946: Financial Services—Investment Companies. Under U.S. GAAP,\nmanagement is required to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements and actual results\nmay differ from those estimates. Subsequent events, if any, through the date that the financial statements were issued, have\nbeen evaluated in the preparation of the financial statements. The following summarizes the significant accounting policies\nof the Funds:\nFund Valuation.Each Board of Trustees (“Board” or “Trustees”), including a majority of the Trustees who are not “interested\npersons” of each Fund, have designated Calamos Advisors LLC (“Calamos Advisors”, or the “Advisor”) to perform fair\nvaluation determinations related to all Funds’ investments under the oversight of the Board. As “valuation designee” Calamos\nAdvisors has adopted policies and procedures to guide the determination of the net asset value (“NAV”) on any day on\nwhich each Fund’s NAV is determined. The valuation of each Fund’s investments is in accordance with these procedures.\nFunds’ securities that are traded on U.S. securities exchanges, except option securities, are valued at the official closing price,\nwhich is the last current reported sales price on its principal exchange at the time the Fund determines its NAV. Securities\ntraded in the over-the-counter market and quoted on The NASDAQ Stock Market are valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing\nPrice, as determined by NASDAQ, or lacking a NASDAQ Official Closing Price, the last current reported sale price on NASDAQ\nat the time the Fund determines its NAV. When a last sale or closing price is not available, equity securities, other than option\nsecurities, that are traded on a U.S. securities exchange and other equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market\nare valued at the mean between the most recent bid and asked quotations on its principal exchange in accordance with\nguidelines adopted by the Board. Each option security traded on a U.S. securities exchange is valued at the mid-point of the\nconsolidated bid/ask quote for the option security, also in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Board of Trustees. Each\nover-the-counter option that is not traded through the Options Clearing Corporation is valued either by an independent\npricing agent approved by the Board or based on a quotation provided by the counterparty to such option under the ultimate\nsupervision of the Board.\nFixed income securities, bank loans, certain convertible preferred securities, and non-exchange traded derivatives are normally\nvalued by independent pricing services or by dealers or brokers who make markets in such securities. Valuations of such\nfixed income securities, bank loans, certain convertible preferred securities, and non-exchange traded derivatives consider\nyield or price of equivalent securities of comparable quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and\nother market data and do not rely exclusively upon exchange or over-the-counter prices.\nTrading on European and Far Eastern exchanges and over-the-counter markets is typically completed at various times before\nthe close of business on each day on which the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) is open. Each security trading on these\nexchanges or in over-the-counter markets may be valued utilizing a systematic fair valuation model provided by an\nindependent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees. The valuation of each security that meets certain criteria in\nrelation to the valuation model is systematically adjusted to reflect the impact of movement in the U.S. market after the\nforeign markets close. Securities that do not meet the criteria, or that are principally traded in other foreign markets, are\nvalued as of the last reported sale price at the time each Fund determines its NAV, or when reliable market prices or quotations\nare not readily available, at the mean between the most recent bid and asked quotations as of the close of the appropriate\nexchange or other designated time. Trading of foreign securities may not take place on every NYSE business day. In addition,\ntrading may take place in various foreign markets on Saturdays or on other days when the NYSE is not open and on which\neach Fund’s NAV is not calculated.\nIf the Advisor’s pricing committee determines that the valuation of a security in accordance with the methods described\nabove is not reflective of a fair value for such security, the security is valued at a fair value by the pricing committee.\n146 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nThe Funds also may use fair value pricing, pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by Calamos Advisors, if trading in\nthe security is halted or if the value of a security it holds is materially affected by events occurring before a Fund’s pricing\ntime but after the close of the primary market or exchange on which the security is listed. Those procedures may utilize\nvaluations furnished by pricing services approved by Calamos Advisors, which may be based on market transactions for\ncomparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally recognized by institutional traders, a\ncomputerized matrix system, or appraisals derived from information concerning the securities or similar securities received\nfrom recognized dealers in those securities.\nWhen fair value pricing of securities is employed, the prices of securities used by each Fund to calculate its NAV may differ\nfrom market quotations or official closing prices. There can be no assurance that each Fund could purchase or sell a portfolio\nsecurity at the price used to calculate each Fund’s NAV.\nVarious inputs are used to determine the value of each Fund’s investments. These inputs are categorized into three broad\nlevels as follows:\n• Level 1 – Prices are determined using inputs from unadjusted quoted prices from active markets (including securities\nactively traded on a securities exchange) for identical assets.\n• Level 2 – Prices are determined using significant observable market inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices,\nincluding quoted prices of similar securities, fair value adjustments to quoted foreign securities, interest rates, credit\nrisk, prepayment speeds, and other relevant data.\n• Level3 –Prices reflect unobservable market inputs (including each Fund’s own judgments about assumptions market\nparticipants would use in determining fair value) when observable inputs are unavailable.\nDebt securities are valued based upon evaluated prices received from an independent pricing service or from a dealer or\nbroker who makes markets in such securities. Pricing services utilize various observable market data and as such, debt\nsecurities are generally categorized as Level 2. The levels are not necessarily an indication of the risk or liquidity of each\nFund’s investments. The summary of the inputs used in valuing each Fund’s holdings are available after each Fund’s Schedule\nof Investments.\nInvestment Transactions. Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis as of April 30, 2024. Net realized\ngains and losses from investment transactions are reported on an identified cost basis. Interest income is recognized using\nthe accrual method and includes accretion of original issue and market discount and amortization of premium. Dividend\nincome is recognized on the ex-dividend date, except that certain dividends from foreign securities are recorded as soon as\nthe information becomes available after the ex-dividend date.\nForeign Currency Translation.Values of investments and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are\ntranslated into U.S. dollars using a rate quoted by a major bank or dealer in the particular currency market, as reported by\na recognized quotation dissemination service.\nThe Funds do not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on\ninvestments from the fluctuations arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are included\nwith the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.\nReported net realized foreign currency gains or losses arise from disposition of foreign currency, the difference in the foreign\nexchange rates between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts\nof dividends, interest and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the ex-date or accrual date and the U.S. dollar equivalent\nof the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes (due to the\nchanges in the exchange rate) in the value of foreign currency and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies held at period end.\nAllocation of Expenses Among Funds. Expenses directly attributable to each respective Fund are charged to the Fund;\ncertain other common expenses of Calamos Advisors Trust, Calamos Investment Trust, Calamos Convertible Opportunities\nand Income Fund, Calamos Convertible and High Income Fund, Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund, Calamos Global Total\nReturn Fund, Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund, Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund, Calamos Long/Short\nEquity & Dynamic Income Trust, Calamos Antetokounmpo Sustainable Equities Trust, and Calamos ETF Trust are allocated\nproportionately among each fund to which the expenses relate in relation to the net assets of each fund or on another\nreasonable basis.\nwww.calamos.com 147\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nIncome Taxes.No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because each Funds’ policy is to continue to qualify as a\nregulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and distribute to shareholders\nsubstantially all of the respective Funds’ taxable income and net realized gains.\nDividends and distributions paid to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends\nand distributions from net investment income and net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income\ntax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent these “book and tax”\ndifferences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal tax-\nbasis treatment. These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency transactions, contingent\npayment debt instruments and methods of amortizing and accreting for fixed income securities. The financial statements\nare not adjusted for temporary differences.\nDistributions to holders of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares (“MRPS”) as described in Note8 are accrued on a daily\nbasis and are treated as an operating expense due to the fixed term of the obligation. The distributions are shown on the\nStatement of Operations as Interest expense and amortization of offering costs on MRPS. For tax purposes, the distributions\nmade to the holders of the MRPS are treated as dividends.\nThe Funds recognized no liability for uncertain tax positions. A reconciliation is not provided as the beginning and ending\namounts of unrecognized benefits are zero, with no interim additions, reductions or settlements. Tax years 2021 – 2023\nremain subject to examination by the U.S. and the State of Illinois tax jurisdictions.\nIndemnifications.Under the Funds’ organizational documents, each Fund is obligated to indemnify its officers and trustees\nagainst certain liabilities incurred by them by reason of having been an officer or trustee of the Fund. In addition, in the\nnormal course of business, a Fund may enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other parties. A Fund’s\nmaximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against a\nFund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Funds’ management expects the risk of material loss in connection to a\npotential claim to be remote.\nNote 2 – Investment Adviser and Transactions With Affiliates Or Certain Other Parties\nPursuant to an investment advisory agreement with Calamos Advisors, each Fund pays an annual fee, payable monthly based\non the average weekly managed assets of the Fund, as shown below:\nFUND ANNUAL RATE\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund 0.80%\nConvertible and High Income Fund 0.80%\nStrategic Total Return Fund 1.00%\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 1.00%\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 1.00%\nGlobal Total Return Fund 1.00%\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 1.35%\nEach Fund reimburses Calamos Advisors for a portion of compensation paid to each Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer. This\ncompensation is reported as part of the “Trustees’ fees and officer compensation” expense on the Funds’ Statements of\nOperations.\nThe Funds have adopted a deferred compensation plan (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, a trustee who is not an “interested\nperson” (as defined in the 1940Act) and has elected to participate in the Plan (a “participating trustee”) may defer receipt\nof all or a portion of his compensation from the Trust. The deferred compensation payable to the participating trustee is\ncredited to the trustee’s deferral account as of the business day such compensation would have been paid to the participating\ntrustee. The value of amounts deferred for a participating trustee is determined by reference to the change in value of ClassI\nshares of one or more funds of the Calamos Investment Trust designated by the participant. The value of the account increases\nwith contributions to the account or with increases in the value of the measuring shares, and the value of the account\ndecreases with withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the measuring shares.\n148 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nAt April30, 2024, the Funds had deferred compensation balances, which are included in “Other assets” on the Statements\nof Assets and Liabilities, as follows:\nFUND AMOUNT\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund $202,110\nConvertible and High Income Fund 174,425\nStrategic Total Return Fund 246,919\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 0\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 93,822\nGlobal Total Return Fund 59,621\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 0\nEach Fund’s obligation to make payments under the Plan is a general obligation of the Fund and is included in “Payable for\ndeferred compensation to trustees” on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities at April30, 2024.\nNote 3 – Investments\nThe cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of long-term investments, excluding investments sold short, for the period\nended April30, 2024 are shown in the table below.

Each Fund may sell a security it does not\nown in anticipation of a decline in the value of that security before the delivery date. When a Fund sells a security short, it\nmust borrow the security sold short and deliver it to the broker-dealer through which it made the short sale. Dividends paid\n150 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\non securities sold short are disclosed as an expense on the Statements of Operations. A gain, limited to the price at which a\nFund sold the security short, or a loss, unlimited in size, will be realized upon the termination of a short sale.\nTo secure its obligation to deliver to the broker-dealer the securities sold short, a Fund must segregate an amount of cash or\nliquid securities with its custodian equal to any excess of the current market value of the securities sold short over any cash\nor liquid securities deposited as collateral with the broker in connection with the short sale (not including the proceeds of\nthe short sale). As a result of that requirement, a Fund will not gain any leverage merely by selling short, except to the extent\nthat it earns interest or other income or gains on the segregated cash or liquid securities while also being subject to the\npossibility of gain or loss from the securities sold short.\nNote 6 – Derivative Instruments\nForeign Currency Risk.Each Fund may engage in portfolio hedging with respect to changes in currency exchange rates by\nentering into forward foreign currency contracts to purchase or sell currencies. A forward foreign currency contract is a\ncommitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. Risks associated with such\ncontracts include, among other things, movement in the value of the foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar and the\nability of the counterparty to perform.\nTo mitigate the counterparty risk, a Fund may enter into an International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. Master\nAgreement (“ISDA Master Agreement”) or similar agreement with its derivative contract counterparties. An ISDA Master\nAgreement is a bilateral agreement between a Fund and a counterparty that governs over-the-counter derivatives and foreign\nexchange contracts and typically contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event\nof a default and/or termination event. Under an ISDA Master Agreement, a Fund may, under certain circumstances, offset\nwith the counterparty certain derivative financial instrument’s payables and/or receivables with collateral held and/or posted\nand create one single net payment. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement typically permit a single net payment in\nthe event of default (close-out netting) including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty. Generally, collateral is\nexchanged between a Fund and the counterparty and the amount of collateral due from a Fund or to a counterparty has to\nexceed a minimum transfer amount threshold before a transfer has to be made. To the extent amounts due to the Fund\nfrom its counterparties are not fully collateralized, contractually or otherwise, the Fund bears the risk of loss from counterparty\nnonperformance. When a Fund is required to post collateral under the terms of a derivatives transaction and master netting\nagreement, a Fund’s custodian holds the collateral in a segregated account, subject to the terms of a tri-party agreement\namong a Fund, the custodian and the counterparty. The master netting agreement and tri-party agreement provide, in\nrelevant part, that the counterparty may have rights to the amounts in the segregated account in the event that a Fund\ndefaults in its obligation with respect to the derivative instrument that is subject to the collateral requirement. When a\ncounterparty is required to post collateral under the terms of a derivatives transaction and master netting agreement, the\ncounterparty delivers such amount to a Fund’s custodian. The master netting agreement provides, in relevant part, that the\nFund may have rights to such collateral in the event that the counterparty defaults in its obligation with respect to the\nderivative instrument that is subject to the collateral requirement. Generally before a default, neither a Fund nor the\ncounterparty may resell, rehypothecate, or repledge any collateral that it receives.\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Funds do not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to netting\narrangements in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Each Fund’s net counterparty exposure, if any, is reflected in the\nSchedules of Investments. The net unrealized gain, if any, represents the credit risk to the Fund on a forward foreign currency\ncontract. The contracts are valued daily at forward foreign exchange rates. The Fund realizes a gain or loss when a position\nis closed or upon settlement of the contracts. There were no open forward foreign currency contracts for any of the Funds\nat April30, 2024.\nEquity Risk. Each Fund may engage in option transactions and in doing so achieves similar objectives to what it would\nachieve through the sale or purchase of individual securities. A call option, upon payment of a premium, gives the purchaser\nof the option the right to buy, and the seller of the option the obligation to sell, the underlying security, index or other\ninstrument at the exercise price. A put option gives the purchaser of the option, upon payment of a premium, the right to\nsell, and the seller the obligation to buy, the underlying security, index, or other instrument at the exercise price.\nTo seek to offset some of the risk of a potential decline in value of certain long positions, each Fund may also purchase put\noptions on individual securities, broad-based securities indexes or certain exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”). Each Fund may\nalso seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options on a portion of the equity securities (including\nsecurities that are convertible into equity securities) in a Fund’s portfolio, on broad-based securities indexes, or certain ETFs.\nwww.calamos.com 151\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nWhen a Fund purchases an option, it pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as an asset. When\na Fund writes an option, it receives a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as a liability. The asset or\nliability is adjusted daily to reflect the current market value of the option. If an option expires unexercised, a Fund realizes a\ngain or loss to the extent of the premium received or paid. If an option is exercised, the premium received or paid is recorded\nas an adjustment to the proceeds from the sale or the cost basis of the purchase. The difference between the premium and\nthe amount received or paid on a closing purchase or sale transaction is also treated as a realized gain or loss. The cost of\nsecurities acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The proceeds from securities sold\nthrough the exercise of put options are decreased by the premiums paid. Gain or loss on written options and purchased\noptions is presented separately on the Statements of Operations as net realized gain or loss on written options and net\nrealized gain or loss on purchased options, respectively.\nOptions written by each Fund do not typically give rise to counterparty credit risk since options written obligate each Fund\nand not the counterparty to perform. Exchange traded purchased options have minimal counterparty credit risk to each Fund\nsince the exchange’s clearinghouse, as counterparty to such instruments, guarantees against a possible default. As of April30,\n2024, the Funds had outstanding purchased options and/or written options as listed on the Schedules of Investments.\nInterest Rate Risk. Each Fund may engage in interest rate swaps primarily to hedge the interest rate risk on the Fund’s\nborrowings (see Note7—Notes Payable). An interest rate swap is a contract that involves the exchange of one type of interest\nrate for another type of interest rate. If interest rates rise, resulting in a diminution in the value of the Fund’s portfolio, the\nFund would receive payments under the swap that would offset, in whole or in part, such diminution in value; if interest\nrates fall, the Fund would likely lose money on the swap transaction. Unrealized gains are reported as an asset, and unrealized\nlosses are reported as a liability on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value of swaps, including accruals\nof periodic amounts of interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as change in net unrealized\nappreciation/depreciation on interest rate swaps in the Statements of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded in net\nrealized gain (loss) on interest rate swaps in the Statements of Operations upon payment or receipt of a periodic payment\nor termination of the swap agreements. Swap agreements are stated at fair value. Notional principal amounts are used to\nexpress the extent of involvement in these transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk are much smaller.\nIn connection with these contracts, securities may be identified as collateral in accordance with the terms of the respective\nswap contracts in the event of default or bankruptcy of each Fund. Please see the disclosure regarding ISDA Master\nAgreements under Foreign Currency Risk within this note.\nPremiums paid to or by a Fund are accrued daily and included in realized gain (loss) when paid on swaps in the accompanying\nStatements of Operations. The contracts are marked-to-market daily based upon third party vendor valuations and changes\nin value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Gains or losses are realized upon early termination of the\ncontract. Risks may exceed amounts recognized in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These risks include changes in\nthe returns of the underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the contracts’ terms, counterparty’s\ncreditworthiness, and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the contracts.\nAs of April30, 2024, the Funds had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Funds had outstanding derivative contracts which are reflected on the Statements of Assets and\nLiabilities as follows:\nASSET LIABILITY\nDERIVATIVES DERIVATIVES\nCONVERTIBLE OPPORTUNITIES AND\nINCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $ 404,625 $ —\n$ 404,625 $ —\nCONVERTIBLE AND\nHIGH INCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $ 435,750 $ —\n$ 435,750 $ —\n152 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nASSET LIABILITY\nDERIVATIVES DERIVATIVES\nSTRATEGIC TOTAL RETURN FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $2,206,500 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 1,666,590\n$2,206,500 $1,666,590\nDYNAMIC CONVERTIBLE AND\nINCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $ 342,375 $ —\n$ 342,375 $ —\nGLOBAL DYNAMIC INCOME FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $5,915,311 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 398,719\n$5,915,311 $ 398,719\nGLOBAL TOTAL RETURN FUND\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $1,414,813 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 91,504\n$1,414,813 $ 91,504\nLONG/SHORT EQUITY& DYNAMIC\nINCOME TRUST\nGross amounts at fair value:\nPurchased Options(1) $3,852,463 $ —\nWritten Options(2) — 4,427,252\n$3,852,463 $4,427,252\nFor the period ended April30, 2024, the volume of derivative activity for the Fund is reflected below:*\nPURCHASED WRITTEN\nFUND OPTIONS(1) OPTIONS(2)\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund 5,225 —\nConvertible and High Income Fund 5,650 —\nStrategic Total Return Fund 20,660 9,340\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 4,475 —\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 26,954 4,756\nGlobal Total Return Fund 6,733 1,175\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 194,576 208,866\n* Activity during the period is measured by opened number of contracts for options purchased or written.\n(1) Generally, the Statement of Assets and Liabilities location for Purchased Options is “Investments in securities, at value”.\n(2) Generally, the Statement of Assets and Liabilities location for Written Options is “Options written, at value”.\nwww.calamos.com 153\nNotes to Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNote 7 – Notes Payable\nThe Funds have each entered into an Amended and Restated Liquidity Agreement (the “SSB Agreement”) with State Street\nBank and Trust Company (“SSB”) that allows each Fund to borrow up to a certain limit as shown in the table below, as well\nas engage in securities lending and securities repurchase transactions.\nBORROWING\nLIMIT\nFUND (IN MILLIONS)\nConvertible Opportunities and Income Fund $ 430.0\nConvertible and High Income Fund 480.0\nStrategic Total Return Fund 1,130.0\nDynamic Convertible and Income Fund 370.0\nGlobal Dynamic Income Fund 265.0\nGlobal Total Return Fund 55.0\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust 150.0\nAdvances under the SSB Agreement are secured by assets of the Funds that are held with the Funds’ custodian in a separate\naccount (the “pledged collateral”).

Cash collateral received by SSB on behalf of the Fund is deposited by SSB in a custodial account of the Fund and\nthen applied to repay borrowings under the SSBAgreement, such that the cash advanced to the Fund remains unchanged.\nUpon termination of a securities loan, SSB will advance to the Fund the cash collateral required to be returned by the Fund,\nor secure the appropriate amount through one or more securities lending transactions as the Fund’s agent, and deposit the\namount to a custodial account of the Fund and then subsequently return such amount to the securities borrower against\nreturn of the securities on loan. Again, the net cash to the Fund is unaltered. Only the composition of the advance is changed,\nand regardless of the composition of advances as between cash collateral for securities lending transactions or borrowings\nfrom SSB, they are not reflected separately in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities but as a component of the Notes Payable.\nThe Fund has the right to recall securities which have been lent at any time.

Shares of a closed-end fund are\nlisted on a stock exchange or traded in the over-the-counter market. Like all investment companies, a\nclosed-end fund is professionally managed and offers investors a unique investment solution based on\nits investment objective approved by the fund’s Board of Trustees.\nPotential Advantages of Closed-End Fund Investing\n• Defined Asset Pool Allows Efficient Portfolio Management—Although closed-end fund shares trade\nactively on a securities exchange, this doesn’t affect the closed-end fund manager because there are no new\ninvestors buying into or selling out of the fund’s portfolio.\n• More Flexibility in the Timing and Price of Trades—Investors can purchase and sell shares of closed-\nend funds throughout the trading day, just like the shares of other publicly traded securities.\n• Lower Expense Ratios—The expense ratios of closed-end funds are oftentimes less than those of mutual\nfunds. Over time, a lower expense ratio could enhance investment performance.\n• Closed-End Structure Makes Sense for Less-Liquid Asset Classes—A closed-end structure makes\nsense for investors considering less-liquid asset classes, such as high-yield bonds or micro-cap stocks.\n• Ability to Put Leverage to Work—Closed-end funds may issue senior securities (such as preferred shares\nor debentures) or borrow money to “leverage” their investment positions.\n• No Minimum Investment Requirements\nOPEN-END MUTUAL FUNDS VERSUS CLOSED-END FUNDS\nOPEN-END FUND CLOSED-END FUND\nIssues new shares on an ongoing basis Generally issues a fixed number of shares\nIssues common equity shares Can issue common equity shares and senior securities such\nas preferred shares and bonds\nSold at NAV plus any sales charge Price determined by the marketplace\nSold through the fund’s distributor Traded in the secondary market\nFund redeems shares at NAV calculated at the close of Fund does not redeem shares\nbusiness day\nYou can purchase or sell common shares of closed-end funds daily. Like any other stock, market price will\nfluctuate with the market. Upon sale, your shares may have a market price that is above or below net\nasset value and may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of closed-end funds\nfrequently trade at a discount, which is a market price that is below their net asset value.\nLeverage creates risks which may adversely affect return, including the likelihood of greater volatility of\nnet asset value and market price of common shares and fluctuations in the variable rates of the leverage\nfinancing.\nEach open-end or closed-end fund should be evaluated individually. Before investing carefully consider\nthe fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.\n160 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nLevel Rate Distribution Policy\nUsing a LevelRate Distribution Policy to Promote Dependable Income and Total Return\nCalamos Global Total Return Fund and Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund have implemented a level\nrate distribution policy. The goal of the level rate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable,\nthough not assured, level of cash flow, which can either serve as a stable income stream or, through\nreinvestment, may contribute significantly to long-term total return.\nWe understand the importance that investors place on the stability of dividends and their ability to\ncontribute to long-term total return, which is why we have instituted a level rate distribution policy for\nCalamos Global Total Return Fund and Calamos Global Dynamic Income Fund. Under the policy, monthly\ndistributions paid may include net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, and, if\nnecessary, return of capital. In addition, a limited number of distributions per calendar year may include\nnet realized long-term capital gains. Please refer to each Fund’s financial statements for specific\ninformation about distributions made during the last fiscal year.\nThere is no guarantee that the Funds will realize capital gains in any given year. Distributions are subject\nto recharacterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. All shareholders with taxable\naccounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions\nvia Form 1099-DIV. For purposes of maintaining the level rate distribution policy, the Funds may realize\nshort-term capital gains on securities that, if sold at a later date, would have resulted in long-term capital\ngains. Maintenance of a level rate distribution policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated\nwith the Funds.\nDistributions from the Funds are generally subject to Federal income taxes.\nManaged Distribution Policy\nUsing a Managed Distribution Policy to Promote Dependable Income and Total Return\nCalamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund, Calamos Convertible and High Income Fund,\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund, Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund, and Calamos\nLong/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust have implemented a managed distribution policy. The goal of\nthe managed distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable, though not assured, level of cash\nflow, which can serve either as a stable income stream or, through reinvestment, may contribute\nsignificantly to long-term total return.\nWe understand the importance that investors place on the stability of dividends and their ability to\ncontribute to long-term total return, which is why we have instituted a managed distribution policy for\nCalamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund, Calamos Convertible and High Income Fund,\nCalamos Strategic Total Return Fund, Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund and Calamos\nLong/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust. Under the policy, monthly distributions paid may include net\ninvestment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains and, if\nnecessary, return of capital. Please refer to each Fund’s financial statements for specific information about\ndistributions made during the last fiscal year.\nDistributions of capital decrease a Fund’s total assets and total assets per share and, therefore, could have\nthe effect of increasing a Fund’s expense ratio. In general, the policy of fixing a Fund’s distributions at a\ntargeted rate does not affect a Fund’s investment strategy. However, in order to make these distributions,\non occasion the Funds may have to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time.\nThere is no guarantee that the Funds will realize capital gains in any given year. Distributions are subject\nto re-characterization for tax purposes after the end of the fiscal year. All shareholders with taxable\naccounts will receive written notification regarding the components and tax treatment for distributions\nvia Form 1099-DIV.\nDistributions from the Funds are generally subject to Federal income taxes.\nwww.calamos.com 161\nAutomatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nMaximizing Investment with an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nThe Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan offers a simple, cost-efficient and convenient way to reinvest\nyour dividends and capital gains distributions in additional shares of each Fund, allowing you to increase\nyour investment in the Fund.\nPotential Benefits\n• Compounded Growth: By automatically reinvesting with the Plan, you gain the potential to allow your\ndividends and capital gains to compound over time.\n• Potential for Lower Commission Costs: Additional shares are purchased in large blocks, with brokerage\ncommissions shared among all plan participants. There is no cost to enroll in the Plan.\n• Convenience: After enrollment, the Plan is automatic and includes detailed statements for participants.\nParticipants can terminate their enrollment at any time.\nPursuant to the Plan, unless a shareholder is ineligible or elects otherwise, all dividend and capital gains\non common shares distributions are automatically reinvested by Computershare, as agent for shareholders\nin administering the Plan (“Plan Agent”), in additional common shares of the Fund. Shareholders who\nelect not to participate in the Plan will receive all dividends and distributions payable in cash paid by check\nmailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name,\nthen to such nominee) by Plan Agent, as dividend paying agent. Shareholders may elect not to participate\nin the Plan and to receive all dividends and distributions in cash by sending written instructions to the\nPlan Agent, as dividend paying agent, at: Dividend Reinvestment Department, P.O.Box 43078, Providence\nRI 02940-3078. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at\nany time without penalty by giving notice in writing to the Plan Agent; such termination will be effective\nwith respect to a particular dividend or distribution if notice is received prior to the record date for the\napplicable distribution.\nThe shares are acquired by the Plan Agent for the participant’s account either (i) through receipt of\nadditional common shares from the Fund (“newly issued shares”) or (ii) by purchase of outstanding\ncommon shares on the open market (“open-market purchases”) on the NASDAQ or elsewhere. If, on\nthe payment date, the net asset value per share of the common shares is equal to or less than the market\nprice per common share plus estimated brokerage commissions (a “market premium”), the Plan Agent\nwill receive newly issued shares from the Fund for each participant’s account. The number of newly issued\ncommon shares to be credited to the participant’s account will be determined by dividing the dollar\namount of the dividend or distribution by the greater of (i)the net asset value per common share on the\npayment date, or (ii) 95% of the market price per common share on the payment date.\nIf, on the payment date, the net asset value per common share exceeds the market price plus estimated\nbrokerage commissions (a “market discount”), the Plan Agent has a limited period of time to invest the\ndividend or distribution amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. If, before the Plan Agent\nhas completed its open-market purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions exceeds\nthe net asset value of the common shares as of the payment date, the purchase price paid by Plan Agent\nmay exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer common shares\nthan if such dividend or distribution had been paid in common shares issued by the Fund. The weighted\naverage price (including brokerage commissions) of all common shares purchased by the Plan Agent as\nPlan Agent will be the price per common share allocable to each participant. If the Plan Agent is unable to\ninvest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the purchase period or if the market\ndiscount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-\nmarket purchases and will invest the uninvested portion of the dividend or distribution amount in newly\nissued shares at the net asset value per common share at the close of business on the last purchase date.\nThe automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve participants of any federal,\nstate or local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends even though\nno cash is received by participants.\n162 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nAutomatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan\nThere are no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund as a result of dividends\nor distributions payable either in shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of\nbrokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent’s open-market purchases in connection\nwith the reinvestment of dividends or distributions. If a participant elects to have the Plan Agent sell part\nor all of his or her common shares and remit the proceeds, such participant will be charged his or her pro\nrata share of brokerage commissions on the shares sold, plus a $15 transaction fee.

The DSTA Control Share\nStatute became automatically applicable to the Funds on August1, 2022.\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute defines “control beneficial interests” (referred to as “control shares”\nherein) by reference to a series of voting power thresholds and provides that a holder of control shares\nacquired in a control share acquisition has no voting rights under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (DSTA)\nor each Fund’s Governing Documents (as used herein, “Governing Documents” means each Fund’s\nAgreement and Declaration of Trust and By-Laws, together with any amendments or supplements thereto,\nincluding any Statement of Preferences establishing a series of preferred shares, as applicable) with respect\nto the control shares acquired in the control share acquisition, except to the extent approved by a Fund’s\nshareholders by the affirmative vote of two—thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter,\nexcluding all interested shares (generally, shares held by the acquiring person and their associates and\nshares held by Fund insiders).\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute provides for a series of voting power thresholds above which shares are\nconsidered control shares. Whether one of these thresholds of voting power is met is determined by\nwww.calamos.com 163\nAdditional Fund Information: Delaware Statutory Trust Act – Control Share Acquisitions\naggregating the holdings of the acquiring person as well as those of his, her or its “associates.” These\nthresholds are:\n• 10% or more, but less than 15% of all voting power;\n• 15% or more, but less than 20% of all voting power;\n• 20% or more, but less than 25% of all voting power;\n• 25% or more, but less than 30% of all voting power;\n• 30% or more, but less than a majority of all voting power; or\n• a majority or more of all voting power.\nUnder the DSTA Control Share Statute, once a threshold is reached, an acquirer has no voting rights with\nrespect to shares in excess of that threshold (i.e., the “control shares”) until approved by a vote of\nshareholders, as described above, or otherwise exempted by the Funds’ Board of Trustees. The DSTA\nControl Share Statute contains a statutory process for an acquiring person to request a shareholder\nmeeting for the purpose of considering the voting rights to be accorded control shares. An acquiring\nperson must repeat this process at each threshold level.\nUnder the DSTA Control Share Statute, an acquiring person’s “associates” are broadly defined to include,\namong others, relatives of the acquiring person, anyone in a control relationship with the acquiring person,\nany investment fund or other collective investment vehicle that has the same investment adviser as the\nacquiring person, any investment adviser of an acquiring person that is an investment fund or other\ncollective investment vehicle and any other person acting or intending to act jointly or in concert with\nthe acquiring person.\nVoting power under the DSTA Control Share Statute is the power (whether such power is direct or indirect\nor through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise) to directly or indirectly\nexercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of shares of a Fund in the election of each Fund’s\nTrustees (either generally or with respect to any subset, series or class of trustees, including any Trustees\nelected solely by a particular series or class of shares, such as the preferred shares). Thus, a Fund’s preferred\nshares, as applicable, acquired in excess of the above thresholds would be considered control shares with\nrespect to the preferred share class vote for two Trustees.\nAny control shares of the Fund acquired before August1, 2022 are not subject to the DSTA Control Share\nStatute; however, any further acquisitions on or after August1, 2022 are considered control shares subject\nto the DSTA Control Share Statute.\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute requires shareholders to disclose to a Fund any control share acquisition\nwithin 10 days of such acquisition, and also permits the Fund to require a shareholder or an associate of\nsuch person to disclose the number of shares owned or with respect to which such person or an associate\nthereof can directly or indirectly exercise voting power. Further, the DSTA Control Share Statute requires\na shareholder or an associate of such person to provide to the Fund within 10 days of receiving a request\ntherefor from the Fund any information that the Fund’s Trustees reasonably believe is necessary or desirable\nto determine whether a control share acquisition has occurred.\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute permits the Funds’ Board of Trustees, through a provision in each Fund’s\nGoverning Documents or by Board action alone, to eliminate the application of the DSTA Control Share\nStatute to the acquisition of control shares in the Fund specifically, generally, or generally by types, as to\nspecifically identified or unidentified existing or future beneficial owners or their affiliates or associates or\nas to any series or classes of shares. The DSTA Control Share Statute does not provide that the Fund can\ngenerally “opt out” of the application of the DSTA Control Share Statute; rather, specific acquisitions or\nclasses of acquisitions may be exempted by the Board of Trustees, either in advance or retroactively, but\nother aspects of the DSTA Control Share Statute, which are summarized above, would continue to apply.\n164 CALAMOS CLOSED-END FAMILY OF FUNDS SEMIANNUAL REPORT\nAdditional Fund Information: Delaware Statutory Trust Act – Control Share Acquisitions\nThe DSTA Control Share Statute further provides that the Board of Trustees is under no obligation to\ngrant any such exemptions.\nThe foregoing is only a summary of the material terms of the DSTA Control Share Statute. Shareholders\nshould consult their own counsel with respect to the application of the DSTA Control Share Statute to\nany particular circumstance.\nwww.calamos.com 165\nThis page intentionally left blank.\nMANAGING YOUR CALAMOS\nFUNDS INVESTMENTS\nCalamos Investments offers several convenient means\nto monitor, manage and feel confident about your\nCalamos investment choice.\nPERSONAL ASSISTANCE: 800.582.6959\nDial this toll-free number to speak with a knowledgeable Client\nServices Representative who can help answer questions or\naddress issues concerning your Calamos Fund.\nONLINE ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT:\nwww.calamos.com\nManage your personal account of Calamos Funds online at\nwww.calamos.com.

The change also permits the Fund to invest up to 40% of the Fund’s managed assets in diversified\nincome-producing securities.

The Long/Short Component will comprise at least 60% of the Fund’s managed assets with a focus on\nabsolute returns in a risk-managed format. The Fund may invest up to 40% of its managed assets opportunistically in\nthe Fixed Income Sleeve.\nEffective on February12, 2024, the fourth paragraph of the “Investment Policies” section on the cover page of\nthe Prospectus will be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:\nIn the Fixed Income Sleeve, the Fund will mainly invest in a diversified portfolio of income producing securities\nincluding, high-yield and investment grade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt securities, securitized\nproducts, U.S. Treasuries and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments. Some of the loans in which the Fund\nmay invest may be “covenant-lite” loans, which means the loans contain fewer or no maintenance covenants than\nother loans and do not include terms which allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower and declare a\ndefault if certain criteria are breached.\nEffective on February12, 2024, the section titled “Investment Strategies and Policies” on page 2 of the\nProspectus will be deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:\nPrimary Investments.The Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its managed assets in a\ndiversified portfolio comprised of (a)equity securities which are defined to include common stock, preferred stock,\nconvertible securities and exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) (the “Equity Sleeve”); (ii)long and short equity positions\nmanaged pursuant to a long/short equity strategy (the “Long/Short Component”); and (iii)diversified income-\nproducing securities, including high-yield and investment grade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt\nsecurities, securitized products, U.S. Treasuries and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments (“Fixed Income\nSleeve”).

A long position arises where the Fund\nholds a security in its portfolio. The Fund will have a short position where it sells a security it does not own by\ndelivery of a borrowed security. The Fund may maintain long and short positions through the use of derivative\ninstruments, such as options, futures and forward contracts. The Fund’s Long/Short Component utilizes a variety of\nmethods to evaluate long and short equity investments of various market capitalizations to find securities that the\nAdviser believes offer the potential for capital gains, including common stock and American Depositary Receipts\n(“ADRs”) of issuers of all market capitalizations that operate in knowledge-based sectors such as technology,\ncommunications and media, as well as financial services and healthcare, and other investment companies (including\nETFs) that track or otherwise provide exposure to such sectors. As part of this strategy, the Adviser seeks to invest in\nindustries, sectors and securities that it believes are more attractive on either a relative basis or on an absolute basis.\nIn addition to purchasing, or taking “long” positions in equity securities, the Fund’s investment strategy includes short\nselling, and may include investments in derivatives, ETFs, and/or fixed income securities.\nIn the Fixed Income Sleeve, the Fund will mainly invest in a diversified portfolio of income producing securities\nincluding, high-yield and investment grade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt securities, securitized\nproducts, U.S. Treasuries and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments. Some of the loans in which the Fund\nmay invest may be “covenant-lite” loans, which means the loans contain fewer or no maintenance covenants than\nother loans and do not include terms which allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower and declare a\ndefault if certain criteria are breached.\nThe Fund may invest up to 50% of its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers; provided, however, the\nFund will not invest more than 25% of its managed assets in securities of issuers located in a single country other than\nthe U.S. and 20% of its managed assets in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries. The Fund may\ninvest up to 30% of its managed assets in securities of European domiciled issuers.\nThe Fund’s derivative activities are principally focused on the following derivatives: interest rate swaps,\nconvertible securities, synthetic convertible instruments, options on individual securities, index options, long calls,\ncovered calls, long puts, cash-secured short puts and protective puts. The Fund may utilize derivatives for investment\nand hedging purposes. In addition, as a non-fundamental policy, the Fund may also invest up to 20% of its managed\nassets in derivatives for non-hedging purposes. The use of derivatives for non-hedging purposes may be considered\nmore speculative than other types of investments. However, the Fund reserves the right to invest in other derivative\ninstruments to the extent consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and restrictions. See “Investment Objective\nand Principal Investment Strategies—Principal Investment Strategies—Derivatives.”\nThe portions of the Fund’s assets invested in the aforementioned sleeves and securities will vary from time to\ntime consistent with the Fund’s investment objective. In addition, the Adviser has appointed a committee consisting of\nsenior management (the “CPZ Allocation Committee”) to determine the percentage of the Fund’s assets to be\nallocated to each such sleeve. The CPZ Allocation Committee will meet quarterly, or more frequently if needed, to\nreview and adjust the specific allocation ranges based upon its judgment of economic, market and regulatory\nconditions in a manner consistent with the Fund’s investment objective.

In some cases, this would include, for example, an event wherein a government\nauthority publicly announces that such issuer has accepted or agreed to accept a capital injection, or equivalent support, from such\nauthority (or agent or agency thereof) without which the issuer would have been determined to be non-viable. Such contingent\ncapital securities are typically issued as either subordinated debt instruments or preferred shares and are convertible either into\ncommon shares of the issuer or subject to principal write-down, upon the occurrence of a trigger event.\nThe Fund will not invest in types of contingent capital securities (often referred to as contingent convertible capital securities, or\n“CoCos”) that are subject to either a mandatory conversion into equity or an automatic write-down of principal upon the\noccurrence of certain “trigger events.” The trigger events are generally linked to regulatory capital thresholds or regulatory actions\ncalling into question the issuing banking institution’s continued viability as a going-concern. CoCos’ unique equity conversion\nor principal write-down features are tailored to the issuing banking institution and its regulatory requirements. CoCos can be\nwritten down to zero if and when certain pre-specified distressed conditions occur.\nSome additional risks of investing in contingent capital securities include:\n• Market Value Fluctuations – The value of contingent capital securities is unpredictable and will be influenced by many\nfactors including, without limitation: (i) the creditworthiness and financial condition of the issuer and/or fluctuations in\nsuch issuer’s applicable capital ratios; (ii) supply and demand for the securities; (iii) general market conditions and\navailable liquidity; and (iv) economic, financial and political events that affect the underlying issuer, its particular market or\nthe financial markets in general.\nDate: 09/30/2023 07:14 AM Toppan Merrill Project: 23-26900-3 Form Type: 424B3\nClient: 23-26900-3_Calamos - Calamos Long/Short Equity & Dynamic Income Trust_424B3 File: tm2326900d3_424b3.htm Type: 424B3 Pg: 2 of 2\n• Subordination of Debt, Loss of Income and/or Conversion to Equity. If the securities are converted into the\nissuer’s underlying equity securities following a conversion event (i.e., a “trigger”), each holder will be subordinated to the\nunderlying issuer’s other preferred security classes due to its conversion from being the holder of a debt instrument to being\nthe holder of an equity instrument. As a result, the Fund could experience loss of interest or dividends resulting in a\nreduced income rate, potentially to zero, as a result of the issuer’s common stock being converted. In addition, the value of\nthe issuer’s common stock following such conversion may have declined, perhaps substantially, and may continue to\ndecline, which may adversely affect the Fund’s net asset value.\n• Risk of Loss of Principal – Contingent convertible securities that are subject to a write down of principal can be written\ndown to zero under certain conditions. The Fund could lose all of its investment in such contingent capital securities, which\nmay adversely affect the Fund’s net asset value.\nPlease retain this supplement for future reference.\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Calamos Long-Short Equity _ Dynamic Income Trust N-2 CPZ 01-19-2022 ED | rwaldoc | 19-Jan-22 15:17 | 22-2670-7.aa | Sequence: 1\nCHKSUM Content: 20217 Layout: 53992 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nFiled pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)\nFile No.333-220591\nCalamos Long/Short Equity& Dynamic Income Trust (the “Fund”)\nSupplement dated January19, 2022 to the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information\ndated November26, 2019\nEffective immediately, the tenth paragraph under the section titled “Investment Restrictions” on\npage S-26 of the Statement of Additional Information is deleted in its entirety and replaced with\nthe following:\nUnder the 1940Act, the Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in the aggregate in shares of\nother investment companies and up to 5% of its total assets in any one investment company,\nprovided the investment does not represent more than 3% of the voting stock of the acquired\ninvestment company at the time such shares are purchased and except as permitted under the\n1940Act, the rules thereunder or SEC exemptive relief. Currently, under the 1940Act and the\nrules thereunder and SEC exemptive relief, a Fund may invest in other investment companies in\nexcess of the above limitations if the Fund complies with Rule12d1-4 under the 1940Act. The\nFund may also invest without limitation in money market funds, provided the Fund complies with\nRule12d1-1 under the 1940Act. These limitations do not apply, however, in connection with a\nmerger, consolidation, reorganization or acquisition of substantially all the assets of another\ninvestment company, or to purchases of investment companies done in accordance with SEC\nexemptive relief or rule. As a shareholder in any investment company, the Fund will bear its\nratable share of that investment company’s expenses, and would remain subject to payment of the\nFund’s advisory fees and other expenses with respect to assets so invested. Holders of common\nshares would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the Fund invests in other\ninvestment companies. In addition, the securities of other investment companies may also be\nleveraged and will therefore be subject to the same leverage risks described herein and in the\nprospectus. As described in the prospectus in the section entitled “Risks,” the net asset value and\nmarket value of leveraged shares will be more volatile and the yield to shareholders will tend to\nfluctuate more than the yield generated by unleveraged shares\nJOB: 22-2670-7 CYCLE#;BL#: 3; 0 TRIM: 8.50\" x 11.00\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: ~HTML color, ~watermark, ~note-color 2, Black GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Calamos Long-Short Equity _ Dynamic Income Trust N-2 CPZ 01-19-2022 ED | rwaldoc | 19-Jan-22 15:17 | 22-2670-7.aa | Sequence: 2\nCHKSUM Content: 51603 Layout: 40442 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nEffective immediately, the table titled “Trustees who Are Not Interested Persons of the Fund” on\npages 27-29 of the Statement of Additional Information is deleted and replaced with the following:\nTrustees who Are Not Interested Persons of the Fund:\nPOSITION(S) PORTFOLIOS\nAND IN EXPERIENCE,\nLENGTH OF FUND PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION(S) QUALIFICATIONS,\nNAME AND TIME WITH COMPLEX^ DURING THE PAST 5 YEARS ATTRIBUTES, SKILLS\nYEAR OF BIRTH THE FUND OVERSEEN AND OTHER DIRECTORSHIPS FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP\nJohn E.

The\ndeferred compensation payable to the participating trustee is credited to the trustee’s deferred\ncompensation account as of the business day such compensation otherwise would have been paid\nto the trustee. The value of a trustee’s deferred compensation account at any time is equal to what\nthe value would be if the amounts credited to the account had instead been invested in ClassI\nshares of one or more of the funds of Calamos Investment Trust as designated by the trustee.\nThus, the value of the account increases with contributions to the account or with increases in the\nvalue of the measuring shares, and the value of the account decreases with withdrawals from the\naccount or with declines in the value of the measuring shares. If a participating trustee retires, the\ntrustee may elect to receive payments under the plan in a lump sum or in equal annual\ninstallments over a period of five years. If a participating trustee dies, any amount payable under\n5\nJOB: 22-2670-7 CYCLE#;BL#: 3; 0 TRIM: 8.50\" x 11.00\" AS: New York: 212-620-5600\nCOLORS: Black, ~note-color 2 GRAPHICS: none V1.5\nToppan Merrill - Calamos Calamos Long-Short Equity _ Dynamic Income Trust N-2 CPZ 01-19-2022 ED | rwaldoc | 19-Jan-22 15:17 | 22-2670-7.aa | Sequence: 6\nCHKSUM Content: 17891 Layout: 33511 Graphics: 0 CLEAN\nthe Plan will be paid to the trustee’s beneficiaries.

This Statement of Additional Information relates to the Fund’s initial public offering of 18,250,000 common\nshares at $20.00 per share. This Statement of Additional Information does not constitute a prospectus, but should be read in conjunction\nwith the prospectus relating thereto dated the date hereof. This Statement of Additional Information does not include all information\nthat a prospective investor should consider before purchasing any of the Fund’s securities, and investors should obtain and read the\nprospectus prior to purchasing such securities. A copy of the prospectus, annual and semi-annual reports (when available) may be\nobtained without charge by calling 1-800-582-6959. You may also obtain a copy of the prospectus on the Securities and Exchange\nCommission’s website (http://www.sec.gov).

Such investments may\nbe delayed if suitable investments are unavailable at the time or for other reasons. Pending such investment, we anticipate that we will\ninvest the proceeds in securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities, in high quality short-term or long-\nterm debt obligations, or in cash. A delay in the anticipated use of proceeds could lower returns, reduce our distribution to common\nshareholders and reduce the amount of cash available to make interest payments on borrowings and debt securities, respectively.\nINVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES\nThis section supplements the disclosure in the Fund’s prospectus and provides additional information on the Fund’s investment\npolicies or restrictions. Restrictions or policies stated as a maximum percentage of the Fund’s assets are only applied immediately after\na portfolio investment to which the policy or restriction is applicable (other than the limitations on borrowing). Accordingly, any later\nincrease or decrease resulting from a change in values, managed assets or other circumstances will not be considered in determining\nwhether the investment complies with the Fund’s restrictions and policies.\nInvestment Objective\nThe Fund’s investment objective is to seek current income and risk-managed capital appreciation. There can be no assurance that\nthe Fund will achieve its investment objective.\nPrimary Investments\nThe Fund will invest, under normal circumstances, at least of 80% of its managed assets in a globally diversified portfolio\ncomprised of equity securities which are defined to include common stock, preferred stock, convertible securities and exchange-traded\nfunds (“ETFs”) ( the “Equity Sleeve”), as well as long and short equity positions managed pursuant to a long/short equity strategy (the\n“Long/Short Component”). The Long/Short Component will comprise at least 50% of the Fund’s managed assets with a focus on\nabsolute returns in a risk-managed format. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its managed assets opportunistically in globally\ndiversified income-producing securities including high-yield and investment grade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt\nsecurities, securitized products, U.S. Treasuries and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments (the “Fixed Income Sleeve”). Under\ncurrent market conditions, it is anticipated that the Fund will invest initially 80% of its managed assets in the Equity Sleeve, consisting\nof equities, of which 60% will be invested in the Long/Short Component, and 20% of its managed assets in the Fixed Income Sleeve.\nThe Fund will invest in common stock, preferred stock and convertible securities (including synthetic convertible instruments)\nissued by both U.S. and foreign companies without regard to market capitalization. Convertible securities include, but are not limited to,\ncorporate debt securities, debentures, notes or preferred stock that may be converted into equity securities of companies around the\nworld, including in emerging markets. A synthetic convertible instrument is a financial instrument (or two or more securities held in\ntandem) that is designed to simulate the economic characteristics of a convertible security through the combined features of a debt\ninstrument and a security providing an option on an equity security.\nIn the Long/Short Component, the Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by taking long positions in companies that are\nexpected to outperform the equity markets, while taking short positions in companies that are expected to underperform the equity\nmarkets and/or for hedging purposes. A long position arises where the Fund holds a security in its portfolio. The Fund will have a short\nposition where it sells a security it does not own by delivery of a borrowed security. The Fund may maintain long and short positions\nthrough the use of derivative instruments such as options, futures and forward contracts including up to 20% of the Fund’s managed\nassets\n1\nfor non-hedging purposes. The Fund’s Long/Short Component utilizes a variety of methods to evaluate long and short equity\ninvestments of various market capitalizations to find securities that the Adviser believes offer the potential for capital gains, including\ncommon stock and American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”) of issuers of all market capitalizations that operate in knowledge-based\nsectors such as technology, communications and media, as well as financial services and healthcare, and other investment companies\n(including ETFs) that track or otherwise provide exposure to such sectors. As part of this strategy, the Adviser seeks to invest in\nindustries, sectors and securities that it believes are more attractive on either a relative basis or on an absolute basis. In addition to\npurchasing, or taking “long” positions in equity securities, the Fund’s investment strategy includes short selling, and may include\ninvestments in derivatives, ETFs, and/or fixed income securities.\nIn the Fixed Income Sleeve, the Fund will mainly invest in a globally-diversified portfolio of income producing securities\nincluding, high-yield and investment grade corporate securities, leveraged loans, distressed debt securities, securitized products, U.S.\nTreasuries and sovereign debt issued by foreign governments. Some of the loans in which the Fund may invest may be “covenant-lite”\nloans, which means the loans contain fewer or no maintenance covenants than other loans and do not include terms which allow the\nlender to monitor the performance of the borrower and declare a default if certain criteria are breached.\nThe portions of the Fund’s assets invested in the aforementioned sleeves and securities will likely vary from time to time\nconsistent with the Fund’s investment objective. In addition, the Adviser has appointed a committee consisting of senior management\n(the “CPZ Allocation Committee”) to determine the percentage of the Fund’s assets to be allocated to each such sleeve. The CPZ\nAllocation Committee will meet quarterly, or more frequently if needed, to review and adjust the specific allocation ranges based upon\nits judgment of economic, market and regulatory conditions in a manner consistent with the Fund’s investment objective. Actual\nallocations may vary at any time due to market movements, changes in equity prices, changes in interest rates and other economic\nfactors.\nThe Fund may invest up to 50% of its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers; provided, however, the Fund will not invest\nmore than 25% of its managed assets in securities of issuers located in a single country other than the U.S. and 20% of its managed\nassets in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its managed assets in securities\nof European domiciled issuers. The Fund may seek to generate income from options premiums by writing options. The Fund may write\ncall options on some or all of the equity securities in the portfolio and on broad based securities indices of certain ETFs that trade like\ncommon stocks but seek to replicate certain market indices. “Managed assets” means the total assets of the Fund (including any assets\nattributable to any financial leverage that may be outstanding) minus the sum of liabilities (other than debt representing financial\nleverage). For this purpose, the liquidation preference on the preferred shares will not constitute a liability. These policies, as well as the\nsubsequent strategies and policies listed in this section, are non-fundamental policies and may be changed by the Board of Trustees of\nthe Fund provided that shareholders are provided with at least 60 days’ prior written notice of any change as required by the rules under\nthe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”).\nThe Fund’s derivative activities are principally focused on the following derivatives: interest rate swaps, convertible securities,\nsynthetic convertible instruments, options on individual securities, index options, long calls, covered calls, long puts, cash-secured short\nputs and protective puts. The Fund may use derivatives for investment and hedging purposes. In addition, as a non-fundamental policy,\nthe Fund may also invest up to 20% of its managed assets in derivatives for non-hedging purposes. The use of derivatives\nfor non-hedging purposes may be considered more speculative than other types of investments. However, the Fund reserves the right to\ninvest in other derivative instruments to the extent it is consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and restrictions.\nThe Fund may seek to generate income from option premiums by writing (selling) options. This would include the use of both call\nand put options. The Fund may write call options (i) on a portion of the equity securities (including securities that are convertible into\nequity securities) in the Fund’s portfolio and (ii) on broad-based securities indexes (such as the S&P 500 or MSCI EAFE) or ETFs. In\naddition, to seek to offset some of the risk of a potential decline in value of certain long positions, the Fund may also purchase put\noptions on individual securities, broad-based securities indexes (such as the S&P 500), or ETFs. In addition, the Fund may engage in\nactive and frequent trading of portfolio securities.\n2\nCalamos Advisors LLC (“Calamos” or the “Adviser”) pursues a fundamental, global approach that incorporates a blend\nof top-down and bottom-up considerations. The advantages of its investment process are based upon: 1) a comprehensive assessment of\nwhat drives share prices; 2) how companies and industries are analyzed; and 3) the flexible management of style, capitalization and\ncountry factors. The Adviser believes that flexible asset allocation across the global equity universe, with less emphasis upon the\ntraditional role of benchmarks, provides the potential for excess returns.\nThe Adviser’s approach is primarily derived from its assessment of corporate and economic fundamentals. Equally, the Fund’s\nstrategy allows for all investment styles (for example, growth versus value, small versus large capitalization) to be considered\ndepending upon a company’s business model, prevailing market conditions and the economic cycle. The Adviser believes that stocks\nwith common style characteristics can behave similarly, often in response to the economic cycle, and that these characteristics are an\nadditional source of return that should be identified.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities include common and preferred stocks, warrants, rights, and depository receipts. Under normal circumstances, the\nFund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in equity securities (including securities that are convertible into equity securities).\nAn investment in the equity securities of a company represents a proportionate ownership interest in that company. Therefore, the Fund\nparticipates in the financial success or failure of any company in which it has an equity interest.\nEquity investments are subject to greater fluctuations in market value than other asset classes as a result of such factors as the\nissuer’s business performance, investor perceptions, stock market trends and general economic conditions. Equity securities are\nsubordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and\nliquidation payments.\nPreferred stocks involve credit risk, which is the risk that a preferred stock in the Fund’s portfolio will decline in price or fail to\nmake dividend payments when due because the issuer of the security experiences a decline in its financial status. In addition to credit\nrisk, investments in preferred stocks involve certain other risks. Certain preferred stocks contain provisions that allow an issuer under\ncertain circumstances to skip distributions (in the case of “non-cumulative” preferred stocks) or defer distributions (in the case of\n“cumulative” preferred stocks). If the Fund owns a preferred stock that is deferring its distributions, the Fund may be required to report\nincome for federal income tax purposes while it is not receiving income from that stock. The Fund must distribute, at least annually, all\nor substantially all of its net investment income, including income from such deferred distributions, to shareholders to avoid federal\nincome and excise taxes. See “Certain Federal Income Tax Matters.” Therefore, if the Fund owns a preferred stock that is deferring its\ndistributions, the Fund may have to dispose of portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash, or may have\nto leverage itself by borrowing the cash, to satisfy distribution requirements. In certain varying circumstances, an issuer may redeem its\npreferred stock prior to a specified date in the event of certain tax or legal changes or at the issuer’s call. In the event of a redemption,\nthe Fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds at comparable rates of return. Preferred stocks typically do not provide any voting\nrights, except in cases when dividends are in arrears for a specified number of periods.\nEquity securities of small and medium-sized companies historically have been subject to greater investment risk than those of\nlarge companies. The risks generally associated with small and medium-sized companies include more limited product lines, markets\nand financial resources, lack of management depth or experience, dependency on key personnel and vulnerability to adverse market and\neconomic developments. Accordingly, the prices of small and medium-sized company equity securities tend to be more volatile than\nprices of large company stocks. Further, the prices of small and medium-sized company equity securities are often adversely affected by\nlimited trading volumes and the lack of publicly available information. See the prospectus for additional information regarding equity\ninvestments and their risks.\nConvertible Securities\nConvertible securities include any corporate debt security or preferred stock that may be converted into underlying shares of\ncommon stock. The common stock underlying convertible securities may be issued by a\n3\ndifferent entity than the issuer of the convertible securities. Convertible securities entitle the holder to receive interest payments paid on\ncorporate debt securities or the dividend preference on a preferred stock until such time as the convertible security matures or is\nredeemed or until the holder elects to exercise the conversion privilege. As a result of the conversion feature, however, the interest rate\nor dividend preference on a convertible security is generally less than would be the case if the security were\na non-convertible obligation.\nThe value of convertible securities is influenced by both the yield of non-convertible securities of comparable issuers and by the\nvalue of the underlying common stock. A convertible security’s value viewed without regard to its conversion feature (i.e., strictly on\nthe basis of its yield) is sometimes referred to as its “investment value.” A convertible security’s investment value typically will\nfluctuate inversely with changes in prevailing interest rates. However, at the same time, the convertible security will be influenced by its\n“conversion value,” which is the market value of the underlying common stock that would be obtained if the convertible security were\nconverted. Conversion value fluctuates directly with the price of the underlying common stock.\nIf, because of a low price of the common stock, a convertible security’s conversion value is substantially below its investment\nvalue, the convertible security’s price is governed principally by its investment value. If a convertible security’s conversion value\nincreases to a point that approximates or exceeds its investment value, the convertible security’s value will be principally influenced by\nits conversion value. A convertible security will sell at a premium over its conversion value to the extent investors place value on the\nright to acquire the underlying common stock while holding a fixed income security. Holders of convertible securities have a claim on\nthe issuer’s assets prior to the common stockholders, but may be subordinated to holders of similar non-convertible securities of the\nsame issuer.\nSynthetic Convertible Instruments\nThe Adviser may create a “synthetic” convertible instrument by combining fixed income securities with the right to acquire equity\nsecurities. More flexibility is possible in the assembly of a synthetic convertible instrument than in the purchase of a convertible\nsecurity. Although synthetic convertible instruments may be selected where the two components are issued by a single issuer, thus\nmaking the synthetic convertible instrument similar to the true convertible security, the character of a synthetic convertible instrument\nallows the combination of components representing distinct issuers, when Calamos believes that such a combination would better\npromote the Fund’s investment objective. A synthetic convertible instrument also is a more flexible investment in that its two\ncomponents may be purchased separately. For example, the Fund may purchase a warrant for inclusion in a synthetic convertible\ninstrument but temporarily hold short-term investments while postponing the purchase of a corresponding bond pending development\nof more favorable market conditions.\nA holder of a synthetic convertible instrument faces the risk of a decline in the price of the security or the level of the index\ninvolved in the convertible component, causing a decline in the value of the call option or warrant purchased to create the synthetic\nconvertible instrument. Should the price of the stock fall below the exercise price and remain there throughout the exercise period, the\nentire amount paid for the call option or warrant would be lost. Because a synthetic convertible instrument includes the fixed income\ncomponent as well, the holder of a synthetic convertible instrument also faces the risk that interest rates will rise, causing a decline in\nthe value of the fixed income instrument.\nThe Fund may also purchase synthetic convertible instruments manufactured by other parties, including convertible structured\nnotes. Convertible structured notes are fixed income debentures linked to equity, and are typically issued by investment banks.\nConvertible structured notes have the attributes of a convertible security; however, the investment bank that issued the convertible note\nassumes the credit risk associated with the investment, rather than the issuer of the underlying common stock into which the note is\nconvertible.\nShort Sales\nA short sale may be effected when Calamos believes that the price of a security will decline or underperform the market, and\ninvolves the sale of borrowed securities, in the hope of purchasing the same securities at a later date at a lower price. There can be no\nassurance that the Fund will be able to close out a short position (i.e., purchase the same securities) at any particular time or at an\nacceptable or advantageous price. To make delivery to the buyer, the\n4\nFund must borrow the securities from a broker-dealer through which the short sale is executed, and the broker-dealer delivers the\nsecurities, on behalf of the Fund, to the buyer. In addition, when the Fund employs a relative value strategy, such as convertible\narbitrage, it may use short sales in combination with long positions in an attempt to improve performance or to reduce overall portfolio\nrisk, but this strategy may not be successful and may result in greater losses or lower positive returns than if the Fund held only long\npositions.\nThe broker-dealer may be entitled to retain the proceeds from the short sale until the Fund delivers to it the securities sold short or\nthe Fund may receive and invest the proceeds. In addition, the Fund is required to pay to the broker-dealer the amount of any dividends\nor interest paid on the securities sold short.\nTo secure its obligation to deliver to the broker-dealer the securities sold short, the Fund must segregate an amount of cash or\nliquid securities that are marked to market daily with its custodian equal to any excess of the current market value of the securities sold\nshort over any cash or liquid securities deposited as collateral with the broker in connection with the short sale (not including the\nproceeds of the short sale). As a result of that requirement, the Fund will not gain any leverage merely by selling short, except to the\nextent that it earns interest or other income or gains on the segregated cash or liquid securities while also being subject to the possibility\nof gain or loss from the securities sold short.\nThe Fund is said to have a short position in the securities sold until it delivers to the broker-dealer the securities sold. The Fund\nwill normally close out a short position by purchasing on the open market and delivering to the broker-dealer an equal amount of the\nsecurities sold short.\nThe Fund will realize a gain if the price of the securities declines between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund\npurchases securities to replace the borrowed securities. On the other hand, the Fund will incur a loss if the price of the securities\nincreases between those dates. The amount of any gain will be decreased and the amount of any loss increased by any premium or\ninterest that the Fund may be required to pay in connection with the short sale. It should be noted that possible losses from short sales\ndiffer from those that could arise from a cash investment in a security in that losses from a short sale may be limitless, while the losses\nfrom a cash investment in a security cannot exceed the total amount of the investment in the security.\nThere is also a risk that securities borrowed by the Fund and delivered to the buyer of the securities sold short will need to be\nreturned to the broker-dealer on short notice. If the request for the return of securities occurs at a time when other short sellers of the\nsecurity are receiving similar requests, a “short squeeze” can occur, meaning that the Fund might be compelled, at the most\ndisadvantageous time, to replace the borrowed securities with securities purchased on the open market, possibly at prices significantly\nin excess of the proceeds received from the short sale.\nIt is possible that the market value of the securities the Fund holds in long positions will decline at the same time that the market\nvalue of the securities the Fund has sold short increases, thereby increasing the Fund’s potential volatility.\nShort sales also may afford the Fund an opportunity to earn additional current income to the extent it is able to enter into\narrangements with broker-dealers through which the short sales are executed to receive income with respect to the proceeds of the short\nsales during the period the Fund’s short positions remain open. Calamos believes that some broker-dealers may be willing to enter into\nsuch arrangements, but there is no assurance that the Fund will be able to enter into such arrangements to the desired degree.\nRule 144A Securities and Other Illiquid Securities\nThe Fund may invest up to 20% of its managed assets in securities that, at the time of investment, are illiquid (i.e., any investment\nthat the Fund reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the\nsale or disposition significantly changing the market value of the investment). The Fund may invest without limit in Rule 144A\nSecurities determined to be liquid. Calamos, under the supervision and oversight of the Board of Trustees, will determine whether\nsecurities purchased under Rule 144A are illiquid (that is, not readily marketable). Investments in Rule 144A Securities could have the\neffect of increasing the amount of the Fund’s assets invested in illiquid securities if qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to\npurchase these Rule 144A Securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Fund believes\nit is desirable to do so. The market price of illiquid securities generally is more volatile than that of more liquid securities, which may\nadversely affect the price that the Fund pays for or recovers upon the sale of illiquid\n5\nsecurities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value and Calamos’ judgment may play a greater role in the valuation process.\nInvestment of the Fund’s assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Fund’s ability to take advantage of market opportunities. The risks\nassociated with illiquid securities may be particularly acute in situations in which the Fund’s operations require cash and could result in\nthe Fund borrowing to meet its short-term needs or incurring losses on the sale of illiquid securities.\nThe Fund may invest in bonds, corporate loans, convertible securities, preferred stocks and other securities that lack a secondary\ntrading market or are otherwise considered illiquid. Liquidity of a security relates to the ability to easily dispose of the security and the\nprice to be obtained upon disposition of the security, which may be less than would be obtained for a comparable more liquid security.\nSuch investments may affect the Fund’s ability to realize the net asset value in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of its\nassets.\nForeign Securities\nThe Fund may invest up to 50% of its managed assets in securities of foreign issuers, with up to 20% of its managed assets in\nsecurities issued by foreign issuers in emerging markets; provided, however, the Fund will not invest more than 25% of its managed\nassets in securities of issuers located in a single country. A foreign security is a security issued by a foreign government or a company\nwhose country of incorporation is a foreign country. For this purpose, foreign securities include American Depositary Receipts\n(“ADRs”) or securities guaranteed by a U.S. person but which represent underlying shares of foreign issuers, and may include foreign\nsecurities in the form of European Depositary Receipts (“EDRs”), Global Depositary Receipts (“GDRs”) or other securities\nrepresenting underlying shares of foreign issuers. Positions in those securities are not necessarily denominated in the same currency as\nthe common stocks into which they may be converted. ADRs are receipts typically issued by an American bank or trust company\nevidencing ownership of the underlying securities. EDRs are European receipts listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange evidencing a\nsimilar arrangement. GDRs are U.S. dollar-denominated receipts issued by international banks evidencing ownership of foreign\nsecurities. Generally, ADRs, in registered form, are designed for the U.S. securities markets and EDRs and GDRs, in bearer form, are\ndesigned for use in foreign securities markets. The Fund may invest in sponsored or unsponsored ADRs. In the case of an unsponsored\nADR, the Fund is likely to bear its proportionate share of the expenses of the depository and it may have greater difficulty in receiving\nshareholder communications than it would have with a sponsored ADR. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its managed assets in\nsecurities of European domiciled issuers.\nTo the extent positions in portfolio securities are denominated in foreign currencies, the Fund’s investment performance is\naffected by the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against those currencies. For example, if the dollar falls in value relative to the\nJapanese yen, the dollar value of a Japanese stock held in the portfolio will rise even though the price of the stock remains unchanged.\nConversely, if the dollar rises in value relative to the yen, the dollar value of the Japanese stock will fall.\nInvestors should understand and consider carefully the risks involved in foreign investing. Investing in foreign securities, which\nare generally denominated in foreign currencies, and utilization of forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain\nconsiderations comprising both risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in U.S. securities. These considerations\ninclude: fluctuations in exchange rates of foreign currencies; possible imposition of exchange control regulation or currency restrictions\nthat would prevent cash from being brought back to the U.S.; less public information with respect to issuers of securities; less\ngovernmental supervision of stock exchanges, securities brokers, and issuers of securities; lack of uniform accounting, auditing and\nfinancial reporting standards; lack of uniform settlement periods and trading practices; less liquidity and frequently greater price\nvolatility in foreign markets than in the U.S.; greater costs of buying, holding and selling securities, including brokerage, tax and\ncustody costs; and sometimes less advantageous legal, operational and financial protections applicable to\nforeign sub-custodial arrangements.\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of located in emerging countries. The securities markets of emerging countries are\nsubstantially smaller, less developed, less liquid and more volatile than the securities markets of the U.S. and other more developed\ncountries. Disclosure and regulatory standards in many respects are less stringent than in the U.S. and other major markets. There also\nmay be a lower level of monitoring and regulation of emerging markets and the activities of investors in such markets, and enforcement\nof existing regulations has been extremely limited. Economies in individual emerging markets may differ favorably or unfavorably from\nthe U.S. economy in\n6\nsuch respects as growth of gross domestic product, rates of inflation, currency depreciation, capital reinvestment, resource self-\nsufficiency and balance of payments positions. Many emerging market countries have experienced high rates of inflation for many\nyears, which has had and may continue to have very negative effects on the economies and securities markets of those countries.\nHigh Yield Securities\nA substantial portion of the Fund’s assets may be invested in below investment grade (high yield, high risk) securities. The high\nyield securities in which the Fund invests are rated “Ba” or lower by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or “BB” or lower by\nStandard & Poor’s Corporation, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (“S&P” or “Standard & Poor’s”) or are unrated but\ndetermined by Calamos to be of comparable quality. Non-convertible debt securities rated below investment grade are commonly\nreferred to as “junk bonds” and are considered speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal.\nBelow investment grade non-convertible debt securities or comparable unrated securities are susceptible to greater risk of default\nor decline in market value due to adverse economic and business developments than higher-rated debt securities. The market values for\nhigh yield securities tend to be very volatile, and these securities are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. For these reasons,\nyour investment in the Fund is subject to the following specific risks:\n• increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment;\n• greater risk of loss due to default or declining credit quality;\n• adverse company specific events are more likely to render the issuer unable to make interest and/or principal payments; and\n• if a negative perception of the high yield market develops, the price and liquidity of high yield securities may be depressed.\nThis negative perception could last for a significant period of time.\nSecurities rated below investment grade are speculative with respect to the capacity to pay interest and repay principal in\naccordance with the terms of such securities. A rating of “Ba1” from Moody’s means that the issue so rated can have speculative\nelements and is subject to substantial credit risk. Standard & Poor’s assigns a rating of “BB+” to issues that are less vulnerable to\nnonpayment than other speculative issues, but nonetheless subject to major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business,\nfinancial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the\nobligation. A rating of “C” from Moody’s means that the issue so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever\nattaining any real investment standing. Standard & Poor’s assigns a rating of “C” to issues that are currently highly vulnerable to\nnonpayment, and the “C” rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action taken, but\npayments on the obligation are being continued (a “C” rating is also assigned to a preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or\nsinking fund payments, but that is currently paying). See Appendix B to this Statement of Additional Information for a description of\nMoody’s and Standard & Poor’s ratings.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of a high yield issuer to make principal\npayments and interest payments than an investment grade issuer. The principal amount of high yield securities outstanding has\nproliferated in the past decade as an increasing number of issuers have used high yield securities for corporate financing. An economic\ndownturn could severely affect the ability of highly leveraged issuers to service their debt obligations or to repay their obligations upon\nmaturity. Similarly, down-turns in profitability in specific industries could adversely affect the ability of high yield issuers in that\nindustry to meet their obligations. The market values of lower quality debt securities tend to reflect individual developments of the\nissuer to a greater extent than do higher quality securities, which react primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates.\nFactors having an adverse impact on the market value of lower quality securities may have an adverse effect on the Fund’s net asset\nvalue and the market value of its common shares. In addition, the Fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek\nrecovery upon a default in payment of principal or interest on its portfolio holdings. In certain circumstances, the Fund may be required\nto foreclose on an issuer’s assets and take possession of its property or operations. In such circumstances, the Fund would incur\nadditional costs in disposing of such assets and potential liabilities from operating any business acquired.\nThe secondary market for high yield securities may not be as liquid as the secondary market for more highly rated securities, a\nfactor which may have an adverse effect on the Fund’s ability to dispose of a particular security when necessary to meet its liquidity\nneeds. There are fewer dealers in the market for high yield securities\n7\nthan investment grade obligations. The prices quoted by different dealers may vary significantly and the spread between the bid and\nasked price is generally much larger than higher quality instruments. Under adverse market or economic conditions, the secondary\nmarket for high yield securities could contract further, independent of any specific adverse changes in the condition of a particular\nissuer, and these instruments may become illiquid. As a result, the Fund could find it more difficult to sell these securities or may be\nable to sell the securities only at prices lower than if such securities were widely traded. Prices realized upon the sale of such lower\nrated or unrated securities, under these circumstances, may be less than the prices used in calculating the Fund’s net asset value.\nBecause investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with lower quality debt securities of the type in which\nthe Fund may invest a portion of its assets, the yields and prices of such securities may tend to fluctuate more than those for higher rated\nsecurities. In the lower quality segments of the debt securities market, changes in perceptions of issuers’ creditworthiness tend to occur\nmore frequently and in a more pronounced manner than do changes in higher quality segments of the debt securities market, resulting in\ngreater yield and price volatility.\nIf the Fund invests in high yield securities that are rated C or below, the Fund will incur significant risk in addition to the risks\nassociated with investments in high yield securities and corporate loans. Distressed securities frequently do not produce income while\nthey are outstanding. The Fund may purchase distressed securities that are in default or the issuers of which are in bankruptcy. The\nFund may be required to bear certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment.\nDistressed Securities\nThe Fund may invest its managed assets in distressed securities, including corporate loans, which are the subject of bankruptcy\nproceedings or otherwise in default as to the repayment of principal and/or payment of interest at the time of acquisition by the Fund or\nare rated in the lower rating categories (“Ca” or lower by Moody’s or “CC” or lower by Standard & Poor’s) or which are unrated\ninvestments considered by Calamos to be of comparable quality. Investment in distressed securities is speculative and involves\nsignificant risk of loss. Distressed securities frequently do not produce income while they are outstanding and may require the Fund to\nbear certain extraordinary expenses in order to protect and recover its investment. Therefore, to the extent the Fund seeks capital\nappreciation through investment in distressed securities, the Fund’s ability to achieve current income for its shareholders may be\ndiminished. The Fund also will be subject to significant uncertainty as to when and in what manner and for what value the obligations\nevidenced by the distressed securities will eventually be satisfied (e.g., through a liquidation of the obligor’s assets, an exchange offer\nor plan of reorganization involving the distressed securities or a payment of some amount in satisfaction of the obligation). In addition,\neven if an exchange offer is made or a plan of reorganization is adopted with respect to distressed securities held by the Fund, there can\nbe no assurance that the securities or other assets received by the Fund in connection with such exchange offer or plan of reorganization\nwill not have a lower value or income potential than may have been anticipated when the investment was made. Moreover, any\nsecurities received by the Fund upon completion of an exchange offer or plan of reorganization may be restricted as to resale. As a\nresult of the Fund’s participation in negotiations with respect to any exchange offer or plan of reorganization with respect to an issuer of\ndistressed securities, the Fund may be restricted from disposing of such securities.\nLoans\nThe Fund may invest up to 5% of its total assets in loan participations and other direct claims against a borrower. The corporate\nloans in which the Fund may invest primarily consist of direct obligations of a borrower and may include debtor in possession\nfinancings pursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, obligations of a borrower issued in connection with a restructuring\npursuant to Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, leveraged buy-out loans, leveraged recapitalization loans, receivables purchase\nfacilities, and privately placed notes. The Fund may invest in a corporate loan at origination as a co-lender or by acquiring in the\nsecondary market participations in, assignments of or novations of a corporate loan. By purchasing a participation, the Fund acquires\nsome or all of the interest of a bank or other lending institution in a loan to a corporate or government borrower. The participations\ntypically will result in the Fund having a contractual relationship only with the lender not the borrower. The Fund will have the right to\nreceive payments of principal, interest and any fees to which it is entitled only from the lender selling the participation and only upon\nreceipt by the lender of the payments from the borrower. Many such loans are secured, although some may be unsecured. Such loans\nmay be in default at the time of purchase. Loans that are fully secured offer the Fund more protection than an unsecured loan in the\nevent of non-payment of scheduled\n8\ninterest or principal. However, there is no assurance that the liquidation of collateral from a secured loan would satisfy the corporate\nborrower’s obligation, or that the collateral can be liquidated. Direct debt instruments may involve a risk of loss in case of default or\ninsolvency of the borrower and may offer less legal protection to the Fund in the event of fraud or misrepresentation. In addition, loan\nparticipations involve a risk of insolvency of the lending bank or other financial intermediary. The markets in such loans are not\nregulated by federal securities laws or the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or the “Commission”).\nAs in the case of other high yield investments, such corporate loans may be rated in the lower rating categories of the established\nrating services (“Ba” or lower by Moody’s or “BB” or lower by Standard & Poor’s), or may be unrated investments considered by\nCalamos to be of comparable quality. As in the case of other high yield investments, such corporate loans can be expected to provide\nhigher yields than lower yielding, higher rated fixed income securities, but may be subject to greater risk of loss of principal and\nincome. There are, however, some significant differences between corporate loans and high yield bonds. Corporate loan obligations are\nfrequently secured by pledges of liens and security interests in the assets of the borrower, and the holders of corporate loans are\nfrequently the beneficiaries of debt service subordination provisions imposed on the borrower’s bondholders. These arrangements are\ndesigned to give corporate loan investors preferential treatment over high yield investors in the event of a deterioration in the credit\nquality of the issuer. Even when these arrangements exist, however, there can be no assurance that the borrowers of the corporate loans\nwill repay principal and/or pay interest in full. Corporate loans generally bear interest at rates set at a margin above a generally\nrecognized base lending rate that may fluctuate on a day-to-day basis, in the case of the prime rate of a U.S. bank, or which may be\nadjusted on set dates, typically 30 days but generally not more than one year, in the case of the London Interbank Offered Rate.\nConsequently, the value of corporate loans held by the Fund may be expected to fluctuate significantly less than the value of other fixed\nrate high yield instruments as a result of changes in the interest rate environment. On the other hand, the secondary dealer market for\ncertain corporate loans may not be as well developed as the secondary dealer market for high yield bonds, and therefore presents\nincreased market risk relating to liquidity and pricing concerns.\nReal Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”) and Associated Risk Factors\nThe Fund may invest in the equity securities of REITs (convertible securities are excluded from this limitation).\nREITs are pooled investment vehicles which invest primarily in income-producing real estate or real estate related loans or\ninterests. REITs are generally classified as equity REITs, mortgage REITs or a combination of equity and mortgage REITs. Equity\nREITs invest the majority of their assets directly in real property and derive income primarily from the collection of rents. Equity REITs\ncan also realize capital gains by selling properties that have appreciated in value. Mortgage REITs invest the majority of their assets in\nreal estate mortgages and derive income from the collection of interest payments. REITs are not taxed on income and gains distributed\nto shareholders provided they comply with the applicable requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended\n(the “Code”). The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other expenses paid by REITs in which it\ninvests in addition to the expenses paid by the Fund. Debt securities issued by REITs are, for the most part, general and unsecured\nobligations and are subject to risks associated with REITs.\nInvesting in REITs involves certain unique risks in addition to those risks associated with investing in the real estate industry in\ngeneral. An equity REIT may be affected by changes in the value of the underlying properties owned by the REIT. A mortgage REIT\nmay be affected by changes in interest rates and the ability of the issuers of its portfolio mortgages to repay their obligations. REITs are\ndependent upon the skills of their managers and are not diversified. REITs are generally dependent upon maintaining cash flows to\nrepay borrowings and to make distributions to shareholders and are subject to the risk of default by lessees or borrowers. REITs whose\nunderlying assets are concentrated in properties used by a particular industry, such as health care, are also subject to risks associated\nwith such industry.\nREITs (especially mortgage REITs) are also subject to interest rate risks. When interest rates decline, the value of a REIT’s\ninvestment in fixed rate obligations can be expected to rise. Conversely, when interest rates rise, the value of a REIT’s investment in\nfixed rate obligations can be expected to decline. If the REIT invests in adjustable rate mortgage loans the interest rates on which are\nreset periodically, yields on a REIT’s investments in such loans will gradually align themselves to reflect changes in market interest\nrates. This causes the value of such\n9\ninvestments to fluctuate less dramatically in response to interest rate fluctuations than would investments in fixed rate obligations.\nREITs may have limited financial resources, may utilize significant amounts of leverage, may trade less frequently and in a limited\nvolume and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities. Historically, REITs have been\nmore volatile in price than the larger capitalization stocks included in Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index.\nCurrency Exchange Transactions\nCurrency exchange transactions may be conducted either on a spot (i.e., cash) basis at the spot rate for purchasing or selling\ncurrency prevailing in the foreign exchange market or through forward currency exchange contracts (“forward contracts”). Forward\ncontracts are contractual agreements to purchase or sell a specified currency at a specified future date (or within a specified time period)\nand price set at the time of the contract. Forward contracts are usually entered into with banks, foreign exchange dealers and broker-\ndealers, are not exchange traded, and are usually for less than one year, but may be renewed.\nForward currency exchange transactions may involve currencies of the different countries in which the Fund may invest and serve\nas hedges against possible variations in the exchange rate between these currencies. Currency exchange transactions are limited to\ntransaction hedging and portfolio hedging involving either specific transactions or portfolio positions. Transaction hedging is the\npurchase or sale of forward contracts with respect to specific receivables or payables of the Fund accruing in connection with the\npurchase and sale of its portfolio securities or the receipt of dividends or interest thereon. Portfolio hedging is the use of forward\ncontracts with respect to portfolio security positions denominated or quoted in a particular foreign currency. Portfolio hedging allows\nthe Fund to limit or reduce its exposure in a foreign currency by entering into a forward contract to sell such foreign currency (or\nanother foreign currency that acts as a proxy for that currency) at a future date for a price payable in U.S. dollars so that the value of the\nforeign denominated portfolio securities can be approximately matched by a foreign denominated liability. The Fund may not engage in\nportfolio hedging with respect to the currency of a particular country to an extent greater than the aggregate market value (at the time of\nmaking such sale) of the securities held in its portfolio denominated or quoted in that particular currency, except that the Fund may\nhedge all or part of its foreign currency exposure through the use of a basket of currencies or a proxy currency where such currencies or\ncurrency act as an effective proxy for other currencies. In such a case, the Fund may enter into a forward contract where the amount of\nthe foreign currency to be sold exceeds the value of the securities denominated in such currency. The use of this basket hedging\ntechnique may be more efficient and economical than entering into separate forward contracts for each currency held in the Fund. The\nFund may not engage in “speculative” currency exchange transactions.\nIf the Fund enters into a forward contract, its custodian will segregate liquid assets of the Fund having a value equal to the Fund’s\ncommitment under such forward contract from day to day, except to the extent that the Fund’s forward contract obligation is covered by\nliquid portfolio securities denominated in, or whose value is tied to, the currency underlying the forward contract. At the maturity of the\nforward contract to deliver a particular currency, the Fund may either sell the portfolio security related to the contract and make delivery\nof the currency, or it may retain the security and either acquire the currency on the spot market or terminate its contractual obligation to\ndeliver the currency by purchasing an offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it to purchase on the same maturity\ndate the same amount of the currency.\nIt is impossible to forecast with absolute precision the market value of portfolio securities at the expiration of a forward contract.\nAccordingly, it may be necessary for the Fund to purchase additional currency on the spot market (and bear the expense of such\npurchase) if the market value of the security is less than the amount of currency the Fund is obligated to deliver and if a decision is\nmade to sell the security and make delivery of the currency. Conversely, it may be necessary to sell on the spot market some of the\ncurrency received upon the sale of the portfolio security if its market value exceeds the amount of currency the Fund is obligated to\ndeliver.\nIf the Fund retains the portfolio security and engages in an offsetting currency transaction, it will incur a gain or a loss to the\nextent that there has been movement in forward contract prices. If the Fund engages in an offsetting currency transaction, it\nsubsequently may enter into a new forward contract to sell the currency. Should forward prices decline during the period between the\nFund’s entering into a forward contract for the sale of a currency and the date it enters into an offsetting contract for the purchase of the\ncurrency, the Fund will realize a gain to the extent\n10\nthe price of the currency it has agreed to sell exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase. Should forward prices increase,\nthe Fund will suffer a loss to the extent the price of the currency it has agreed to purchase exceeds the price of the currency it has agreed\nto sell. A default on the contract would deprive the Fund of unrealized profits or force the Fund to cover its commitments for purchase\nor sale of currency, if any, at the current market price.\nHedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in\nthat currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines. Hedging transactions also preclude the opportunity for gain if the\nvalue of the hedged currency should rise. Moreover, it may not be possible for the Fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so\ngenerally anticipated that the Fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates. The\ncost to the Fund of engaging in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as the currency involved, the length of the\ncontract period, and prevailing market conditions.\nSwaps, Caps, Floors and Collars\nThe Fund may enter into interest rate, currency, index, credit default, total return and other swaps and the purchase or sale of\nrelated caps, floors and collars. The Fund expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or spread on a particular\ninvestment or portion of its portfolio, to protect against currency fluctuations, as a duration management technique or to protect against\nany increase in the price of securities the Fund anticipates purchasing at a later date. The Fund will not sell interest rate caps or floors\nwhere it does not own securities or other instruments providing the income stream the Fund may be obligated to pay. Interest rate swaps\ninvolve the exchange by the Fund with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g., an exchange of\nfloating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount of principal. A currency swap is an agreement to\nexchange cash flows on a notional amount of two or more currencies based on the relative value differential among them and an index\nswap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional amount based on changes in the values of the reference indexes. A credit default\nswap is an agreement to transfer the credit exposure of fixed income products between parties. The purchase of a cap entitles the\npurchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such cap to the extent that a specified index\nexceeds a predetermined interest rate or amount. The purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to receive payments on a notional\nprincipal amount from the party selling such floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest rate or\namount. A collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or\nvalues for the purchases.\nThe Fund will usually enter into swaps on a net basis, i.e., the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the\npayment date or dates specified in the instrument, with the Fund receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two\npayments. Inasmuch as the Fund will segregate assets (or enter into offsetting positions) to cover its obligations under swaps, Calamos\nbelieves such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the 1940 Act and, accordingly, will not treat them as being subject to\nits borrowing restrictions. The Fund will not enter into any swap, cap, floor or collar transaction unless, at the time of entering into such\ntransaction, the unsecured long-term debt of the securities dealers, financial institutions or other parties with whom the Fund has entered\ninto such a transaction (“Counterparties”), combined with any credit enhancements, is rated at least A by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s\nor has an equivalent rating from an NRSRO or is determined to be of equivalent credit quality by Calamos. If there is a default by the\nCounterparty, the Fund may have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. The swap market has\ngrown substantially in recent years with a large number of banks and investment banking firms acting both as principals and as agents\nutilizing standardized swap documentation. As a result, the swap market has become relatively liquid, however, some swaps may be\nconsidered illiquid. Caps, floors and collars are more recent innovations for which standardized documentation has not yet been fully\ndeveloped and, accordingly, they are less liquid than swaps.\nIn addition, certain categories of interest rate and credit default swaps are, and more in the future will be, centrally cleared. Swaps\nthat are centrally-cleared are subject to the creditworthiness of the clearing organizations involved in the transaction. For example, a\nswap investment by the Fund could lose margin payments deposited with the clearing organization, as well as the net amount of gains\nnot yet paid by the clearing organization, if the clearing organization breaches the swap agreement with the Fund or becomes insolvent\nor goes into bankruptcy. Also, the Fund will be exposed to the credit risk of the futures commission merchant who acts as the Fund’s\nclearing member\n11\non the clearinghouse for a centrally cleared swap. If the Fund’s futures commission merchant becomes bankrupt or insolvent, or\notherwise defaults on its obligations to the Fund, the Fund may not receive all amounts owed to it in respect of its trading, even if the\nclearinghouse fully discharges all of its obligations. In the event of bankruptcy of the Fund’s futures commission merchant, the Fund\nmay be entitled to the net amount of gains the Fund is entitled to receive, plus the return of margin owed to it, only in proportion to the\namount received by the futures commission merchant’s other customers, potentially resulting in losses to the Fund.\nOptions on Securities, Indexes and Currencies\nThe Fund may purchase and sell (write) put options and call options on securities, indexes or foreign currencies. The Fund may\npurchase agreements, sometimes called cash puts, that may accompany the purchase of a new issue of bonds from a dealer. The\nsuccessful use of options depends principally on the price movements of the underlying securities, indices or other reference assets or\nrates. Investing in options can result in a greater potential for profit or loss than directly investing in the underlying assets. The value of\nan option may change because of, including but not limited to, a change in the value of the underlying assets, the passage of time,\nchanges in the market’s perception as to the future price behavior of the underlying assets or rates, or any combination of the foregoing.\nA put option gives the purchaser of the option, upon payment of a premium, the right to sell, and the writer the obligation to buy,\nthe underlying security, commodity, index, currency or other instrument at the exercise price. For instance, the Fund’s purchase of a put\noption on a security might be designed to protect its holdings in the underlying instrument (or, in some cases, a similar instrument)\nagainst a substantial decline in the market value by giving the Fund the right to sell such instrument at the option exercise price. A call\noption, upon payment of a premium, gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy, and the seller the obligation to sell, the\nunderlying instrument at the exercise price. The Fund’s purchase of a call option on a security, financial future, index, currency or other\ninstrument might be intended to protect it against an increase in the price of the underlying instrument that it intends to purchase in the\nfuture by fixing the price at which it may purchase such instrument.\nThe Fund may purchase and sell (write) exchange listed options and over-the-counter (“OTC”) options. Exchange listed options\nare issued by a regulated intermediary such as the Options Clearing Corporation (“OCC”), which guarantees the performance of the\nobligations of the parties to such options. The discussion below uses the OCC as an example, but is also applicable to other financial\nintermediaries.\nWith certain exceptions, OCC issued and exchange listed options generally settle by physical delivery of the underlying security\nor currency, although in the future cash settlement may become available. Index options and Eurodollar instruments are cash settled for\nthe net amount, if any, by which the option is “in-the-money” (i.e., where the value of the underlying instrument exceeds, in the case of\na call option, or is less than, in the case of a put option, the exercise price of the option) at the time the option is exercised. Frequently,\nrather than taking or making delivery of the underlying instrument through the process of exercising the option, listed options are closed\nby entering into offsetting purchase or sale transactions that do not result in ownership of the new option.\nOTC options are purchased from or sold to sellers or purchasers (“Counterparties”) through direct bilateral agreement with the\nCounterparties. In contrast to exchange listed options, which generally have standardized terms and performance mechanics, all the\nterms of an OTC option, including such terms as method of settlement, term, exercise price, premium, guarantees and security, are set\nby negotiation of the parties. The Fund will only sell (write) OTC options (other than OTC currency options) that are subject to\na buy-back provision permitting the Fund to require the Counterparty to sell the option back to the Fund at a formula price within seven\ndays. The Fund generally is expected to enter into OTC options that have cash settlement provisions, although it is not required to do\nso. The staff of the SEC currently takes the position that OTC options purchased by a fund, and portfolio securities “covering” the\namount of a fund’s obligation pursuant to an OTC option sold by it (or the amount of assets equal to the formula price for the\nrepurchase of the option, if any, less the amount by which the option is “in the money”) are illiquid, and are subject to a fund’s\nlimitation on investing no more than 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities.\nThe Fund may also purchase and sell (write) options on securities indexes and other financial indexes. Options on securities\nindexes and other financial indexes are similar to options on a security or other instrument except that, rather than settling by physical\ndelivery of the underlying instrument, they settle by cash settlement, i.e., an option or\n12\nan index gives the holder the right to receive, upon exercise of the option, an amount of cash if the closing level of the index upon\nwhich the option is based exceeds, in the case of a call, or is less than, in the case of a put, the exercise price of the option (except if, in\nthe case of an OTC option, physical delivery is specified). This amount of cash is equal to the excess of the closing price of the index\nover the exercise price of the option, which also may be multiplied by a formula value. The seller of the option is obligated, in return for\nthe premium received, to make delivery of this amount. The gain or loss on an option on an index depends on price movements in the\ninstruments making upon the market, market segment, industry or other composite on which the underlying index is based, rather than\nprimarily on the price movements in individual securities, as is the case with respect to options on securities.\nThe Fund, other than the Long/Short Component, will sell (write) call options and put options only if they are “covered.” A\nwritten option will be considered “covered” to the extent it has entered into an offsetting transaction or otherwise has segregated or\nearmarked cash or liquid assets equal to its uncovered obligations under the written option. For example, a call option written by the\nFund could be covered by purchasing an offsetting call option, by purchasing or holding the underlying reference security or asset (or a\nsecurity convertible into the underlying reference security or asset), or by segregating or earmarking cash or liquid assets equal to the\nexercise price of the written option (or such amount as is not otherwise covered by an offsetting transaction). The Fund writing a call\noption on an index would be considered as holding an offsetting position to the extent the Fund owned portfolio securities substantially\ncorrelating with the movement of the underlying reference index.\nIf an option written by the Fund expires, the Fund realizes a capital gain equal to the premium received at the time the option was\nwritten. If an option purchased by the Fund expires, the Fund realizes a capital loss equal to the premium paid.\nThe Fund will realize a capital gain from a closing purchase transaction if the cost of the closing option is less than the premium\nreceived from writing the option, or, if it is more, the Fund will realize a capital loss. If the premium received from a closing sale\ntransaction is more than the premium paid to purchase the option, the Fund will realize a capital gain or, if it is less, the Fund will\nrealize a capital loss. The principal factors affecting the market value of a put or a call option include supply and demand, interest rates,\nthe current market price of the underlying security or index in relation to the exercise price of the option, the volatility of the underlying\nsecurity or index, and the time remaining until the expiration date.\nA put or call option purchased by the Fund is an asset of the Fund, valued initially at the premium paid for the option. The\npremium received for an option written by the Fund is recorded as a deferred credit. The value of an option purchased or written\nis marked-to-market daily and is valued at the closing price on the exchange on which it is traded or, if not traded on an exchange or no\nclosing price is available, at the mean between the last bid and asked prices.\nRisks Associated with Options\nThere are several risks associated with transactions in options. For example, there are significant differences between the securities\nmarkets, the currency markets and the options markets that could result in an imperfect correlation among these markets, causing a\ngiven transaction not to achieve Calamos’ objective. A decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise of\nskill and judgment, and even a well-conceived transaction may be unsuccessful because of market behavior or unexpected events. The\nFund’s ability to utilize options successfully will depend on Calamos’ ability to predict pertinent market investments, which cannot be\nassured.\nThe Fund’s ability to close out its position as a purchaser or seller (writer) of an OCC or exchange listed put or call option is\ndependent, in part, upon the liquidity of the option market. Among the possible reasons for the absence of a liquid option market on an\nexchange are: (i) insufficient trading interest in certain options; (ii) restrictions on transactions imposed by an exchange; (iii) trading\nhalts, suspensions or other restrictions imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying securities including\nreaching daily price limits; (iv) interruption of the normal operations of the OCC or an exchange; (v) inadequacy of the facilities of an\nexchange or OCC to handle current trading volume; or (vi) a decision by one or more exchanges to discontinue the trading of options\n(or a particular class or series of options), in which event the relevant market for that option on that\n13\nexchange would cease to exist, although outstanding options on that exchange would generally continue to be exercisable in accordance\nwith their terms. If the Fund were unable to close out an option that it has purchased on a security, it would have to exercise the option\nin order to realize any profit or the option would expire and become worthless. If the Fund were unable to close out a covered call\noption that it had written on a security, it would not be able to sell the underlying security until the option expired. As the writer of a\ncovered call option on a security, the Fund foregoes, during the option’s life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market\nvalue of the security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the exercise price of the call. As the writer of a covered\ncall option on a foreign currency, the Fund foregoes, during the option’s life, the opportunity to profit from any currency appreciation.\nThe hours of trading for listed options may not coincide with the hours during which the underlying financial instruments are\ntraded. To the extent that the option markets close before the markets for the underlying financial instruments, significant price and rate\nmovements can take place in the underlying markets that cannot be reflected in the option markets.\nUnless the parties provide for it, there is no central clearing or guaranty function in an OTC option. As a result, if the Counterparty\n(as described above under “Options on Securities, Indexes and Currencies”) fails to make or take delivery of the security, currency or\nother instrument underlying an OTC option it has entered into with the Fund or fails to make a cash settlement payment due in\naccordance with the terms of that option, the Fund may lose any premium it paid for the option as well as any anticipated benefit of the\ntransaction unless the Fund has collected sufficient collateral from the counterparty to cover its exposure. Accordingly, Calamos must\nassess the creditworthiness of each such Counterparty or any guarantor or credit enhancement of the Counterparty’s credit to determine\nthe likelihood that the terms of the OTC option will be satisfied.\nThe Fund may purchase and sell (write) call options on securities indexes and currencies. All calls sold by the Fund must be\n“covered”, other than those sold in the Long/Short Component. Even though the Fund will receive the option premium to help protect it\nagainst loss, a call sold by the Fund exposes the Fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize\nappreciation in the market price of the underlying security or instrument and may require the Fund to hold the security or instrument\nthat it might otherwise have sold. The Fund may purchase and sell (write) put options on securities indexes and currencies. In selling\n(writing) put options, there is a risk that the Fund may be required to buy the underlying index or currency at a disadvantageous price\nabove the market price.\nFutures Contracts and Options on Futures Contracts\nThe Fund may enter into interest rate futures contracts, index futures contracts, volatility index futures contracts and foreign\ncurrency futures contracts. An interest rate, index, volatility index or foreign currency futures contract provides for the future sale by\none party and purchase by another party of a specified quantity of a financial instrument or the cash value of an index1 at a specified\nprice and time. A public market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes (including, but not limited to, the Standard &\nPoor’s 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, the Value Line Composite Index, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index) as\nwell as financial instruments (including, but not limited to, U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Treasury notes, Eurodollar certificates of deposit\nand foreign currencies). Other index and financial instrument futures contracts are available and it is expected that additional futures\ncontracts will be developed and traded. The Fund may enter into such contract if, in Calamos’ opinion, such contract meets the Fund’s\ninvestment parameters.\nThe Fund may purchase and write call and put futures options. Futures options possess many of the same characteristics as options\non securities, indexes and foreign currencies (discussed above). A futures option gives the holder the right, in return for the premium\npaid, to assume a long position (call) or short position (put) in a futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time during the\nperiod of the option. Upon exercise of a call option, the holder acquires a long position in the futures contract and the writer is assigned\nthe opposite short position. In the\n1 A futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash\nequal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the\nindex contract was originally written. Although the value of a securities index is a function of the value of certain specified\nsecurities, no physical delivery of those securities is made.\n14\ncase of a put option, the opposite is true. The Fund might, for example, use futures contracts to hedge against or gain exposure to\nfluctuations in the general level of stock prices, anticipated changes in interest rates or currency fluctuations that might adversely affect\neither the value of the Fund’s securities or the price of the securities that the Fund intends to purchase. Although other techniques could\nbe used to reduce or increase the Fund’s exposure to stock price, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the Fund may be able to\nachieve its desired exposure more effectively and perhaps at a lower cost by using futures contracts and futures options.\nThe Fund will only enter into futures contracts and futures options that are standardized and traded on an exchange, board of trade\nor similar entity, or quoted on an automated quotation system.\nThe success of any futures transaction by the Fund depends on Calamos’ correctly predicting changes in the level and direction of\nstock prices, interest rates, currency exchange rates and other factors. Should those predictions be incorrect, the Fund’s return might\nhave been better had the transaction not been attempted; however, in the absence of the ability to use futures contracts, Calamos might\nhave taken portfolio actions in anticipation of the same market movements with similar investment results, but, presumably, at greater\ntransaction costs.\nWhen the Fund makes a purchase or sale of a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit with its custodian (or broker, if\nlegally permitted) a specified amount of cash or U.S. Government securities or other securities acceptable to the broker (“initial\nmargin”). The margin required for a futures contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified during\nthe term of the contract, although the Fund’s broker may require margin deposits in excess of the minimum required by the exchange.\nThe initial margin is in the nature of a performance bond or good faith deposit on the futures contract, which is returned to the Fund\nupon termination of the contract, assuming all contractual obligations have been satisfied. The Fund expects to earn interest income on\nits initial margin deposits. A futures contract held by the Fund is valued daily at the official settlement price of the exchange on which it\nis traded. Each day the Fund pays or receives cash, called “variation margin,” equal to the daily change in value of the futures contract.\nThis process is known as “marking-to-market.” Variation margin paid or received by the Fund does not represent a borrowing or loan\nby the Fund but is instead settlement between the Fund and the broker of the amount one would owe the other if the futures contract had\nexpired at the close of the previous day. In computing daily net asset value, the Fund will mark-to-market its open futures positions.\nThe Fund is also required to deposit and maintain margin with respect to put and call options on futures contracts written by it.\nSuch margin deposits will vary depending on the nature of the underlying futures contract (and the related initial margin requirements),\nthe current market value of the option and other futures positions held by the Fund.\nAlthough some futures contracts call for making or taking delivery of the underlying securities, usually these obligations are\nclosed out prior to delivery by offsetting purchases or sales of matching futures contracts (same exchange, underlying security or index,\nand delivery month). If an offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price, the Fund engaging in the transaction realizes a\ncapital gain, or if it is more, the Fund realizes a capital loss. Conversely, if an offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase\nprice, the Fund engaging in the transaction realizes a capital gain, or if it is less, the Fund realizes a capital loss. The transaction costs\nmust also be included in these calculations.\nRisks Associated with Futures\nThere are several risks associated with the use of futures contracts and futures options. A purchase or sale of a futures contract or\noption may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract or option. In trying to increase or reduce market\nexposure, there can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the futures contract or option and in the\nportfolio exposure sought. In addition, there are significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could result in an\nimperfect correlation between the markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its objectives. The degree of imperfection of\ncorrelation depends on circumstances such as: variations in speculative market demand for futures, futures options and the related\nsecurities, including technical influences in futures and futures options trading and differences between the securities markets and the\nsecurities underlying the standard contracts available for trading. For example, in the case of index futures contracts, the composition of\nthe index, including the issuers and the weighing of each issue, may differ from\n15\nthe composition of the Fund’s portfolio, and, in the case of interest rate futures contracts, the interest rate levels, maturities and\ncreditworthiness of the issues underlying the futures contract may differ from the financial instruments held in the Fund’s portfolio. A\ndecision as to whether, when and how to use futures contracts involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived\ntransaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected stock price or interest rate trends.\nFutures exchanges may limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in certain futures contract prices during a single trading day. The\ndaily limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day’s\nsettlement price at the end of the current trading session. Once the daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit,\nno more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit. The daily limit governs only price movements during a particular\ntrading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may work to prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions.\nFor example, futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading,\nthereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses. Stock index\nfutures contracts are not normally subject to such daily price change limitations.\nThere can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when the Fund seeks to close out a futures or futures option\nposition. The Fund would be exposed to possible loss on the position during the interval of inability to close, and would continue to be\nrequired to meet margin requirements until the position is closed. In addition, many of the contracts discussed above are relatively new\ninstruments without a significant trading history. As a result, there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or\ncontinue to exist.\nLimitations on Options and Futures\nIf options, futures contracts or futures options of types other than those described herein are traded in the future, the Fund may\nalso use those investment vehicles, provided the board of trustees determines that their use is consistent with the Fund’s investment\nobjective.\nWhen purchasing a futures contract or writing a put option on a futures contract, the Fund must maintain with its custodian (or\nfutures commission merchant (“FCM”), if legally permitted) cash or cash equivalents (including any margin) equal to the market value\nof such contract. When writing a call option on a futures contract, the Fund similarly will maintain with its custodian (or FCM) cash or\ncash equivalents (including any margin) equal to the amount by which such option is in-the-money until the option expires or is closed\nby the Fund.\nThe Fund may not maintain open short positions in futures contracts, call options written on futures contracts or call options\nwritten on indexes if, in the aggregate, the market value of all such open positions exceeds the current value of the securities in its\nportfolio, plus or minus unrealized gains and losses on the open positions, adjusted for the historical relative volatility of the\nrelationship between the portfolio and the positions. For this purpose, to the extent the Fund has written call options on specific\nsecurities in its portfolio, the value of those securities will be deducted from the current market value of the securities portfolio.\nThe use of options and futures is subject to applicable regulations of the SEC, the several exchanges upon which they are traded\nand the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). In addition, the Fund’s ability to use options and futures may be limited\nby tax considerations. See “Certain Federal Income Tax Matters” below. Pursuant to a claim for exemption filed with the National\nFutures Association on behalf of the Fund pursuant to Rule 4.5 under the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), the Fund is not deemed\nto be a commodity pool operator or a commodity pool under the CEA and is not subject to registration or regulation as such under the\nCEA. The Fund is not subject to regulation under the CEA.\nUnder Rule 4.5, if the Fund uses commodity interests (such as futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps) other than\nfor bona fide hedging purposes (as defined by the CFTC) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish these\npositions (after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on\n16\nany such positions and excluding the amount by which options that are “in-the-money”2 at the time of purchase) may not exceed 5% of\na fund’s NAV, or alternatively, the aggregate net notional value of those positions, as determined at the time the most recent position\nwas established, may not exceed 100% of the Fund’s NAV (after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any\nsuch positions). The Fund is subject to the risk that a change in U.S. law and related regulations will impact the way the Fund operates,\nincrease the particular costs of the Fund’s operation and/or change the competitive landscape. In this regard, any further amendments to\nthe CEA or its related regulations that subject the Fund to additional regulation may have adverse impacts on the Fund’s operations and\nexpenses.\nDebt Obligations of Non-U.S. Governments\nAn investment in debt obligations of non-U.S. governments and their political subdivisions (sovereign debt) involves special risks\nthat are not present in corporate debt obligations. The non-U.S. issuer of the sovereign debt or the non-U.S. governmental authorities\nthat control the repayment of the debt may be unable or unwilling to repay principal or interest when due, and the Fund may have\nlimited recourse in the event of a default. During periods of economic uncertainty, the market prices of sovereign debt may be more\nvolatile than prices of debt obligations of U.S. issuers. In the past, certain non-U.S. countries have encountered difficulties in servicing\ntheir debt obligations, withheld payments of principal and interest and declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on\ntheir sovereign debt.\nA sovereign debtor’s willingness or ability to repay principal and pay interest in a timely manner may be affected by, among other\nfactors, its cash flow situation, the extent of its foreign currency reserves, the availability of sufficient non-U.S. currency, the relative\nsize of the debt service burden, the sovereign debtor’s policy toward its principal international lenders and local political constraints.\nSovereign debtors may also be dependent on expected disbursements from non-U.S. governments, multilateral agencies and other\nentities to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt. The failure of a sovereign debtor to implement economic reforms,\nachieve specified levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of third-party\ncommitments to lend funds to the sovereign debtor, which may further impair such debtor’s ability or willingness to service its debts.\nU.S. Government Obligations\nU.S. Government Obligations include securities that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by various U.S. Government\nagencies and instrumentalities. U.S. Treasury obligations (“U.S. Treasuries”) include Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury\nbonds. U.S. Treasuries also include the separate principal and interest components of U.S. Treasuries that are traded under the Separate\nTrading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities program. U.S. Treasuries are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.\nObligations issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities may be supported by any of the following:\n(a) the full faith and credit of the U.S., (b) the right of the issuer to borrow an amount limited to a specific line of credit from the U.S.\nTreasury, (c) the discretionary authority of the U.S. Treasury to lend to such Government agency or instrumentality, or (d) the credit of\nthe agency or instrumentality. Government agencies that issue or guarantee securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.\ninclude the Government National Mortgage Association and the Small Business Administration. Government agencies and\ninstrumentalities that issue or guarantee securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. include the Federal Farm Credit\nBanks, the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”), the Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (“FNMA”), the Federal Land Bank, the Bank for Cooperatives, the Federal Intermediate Credit Bank, the Federal\nFinancing Bank, the Resolution Funding Corporation, the Financing Corporation of America and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In\nthe case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S., the investor must look principally to the agency issuing or\nguaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the U.S. in the event the agency or\ninstrumentality does not meet its commitment.\n2 A call option is “in-the-money” to the extent, if any, that the value of the futures contract that is the subject of the option exceeds\nthe exercise price. A put option is “in-the-money” if the exercise price exceeds the value of the futures contract that is the subject\nof the option.\n17\nIn September 2008, the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) announced that FNMA and FHLMC\nhad been placed in conservatorship. Since that time, FNMA and FHLMC have received significant capital support through U.S.\nTreasury preferred stock purchases, as well as Treasury and Federal Reserve purchases of their mortgage backed securities (“MBS”).\nThe FHFA and the U.S. Treasury (through its agreement to purchase FNMA and FHLMC preferred stock) have imposed strict limits on\nthe size of their mortgage portfolios. While the MBS purchase programs ended in 2010, the U.S. Treasury continued its support for the\nentities’ capital as necessary to prevent a negative net worth through at least 2012. From the end of 2007 through the first quarter of\n2014, FNMA and FHLMC have received U.S. Treasury support of approximately $187.5 billion through draws under the preferred\nstock purchase agreements. However, they have repaid approximately $203 billion in senior preferred dividends to the U.S. Treasury\nover the same period. FNMA and FHLMC ended the second quarter of 2014 with positive net worth and, as a result, neither required a\ndraw from the U.S. Treasury. In April 2014, FHFA projected that FNMA and FHLMC would require no additional draws from the U.S.\nTreasury through the end of 2015. However, FHFA also conducted a stress test mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, which suggested that\nin a “severely adverse scenario” additional U.S. Treasury support of between $84.4 billion and $190 billion (depending on the treatment\nof deferred tax assets) might be required. Nonetheless, no assurance can be given that the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Treasury will\nensure that FNMA and FHLMC remain successful in meeting their obligations with respect to the debt and MBS that they issue.\nIn addition, the problems faced by FNMA and FHLMC, resulting in their being placed into federal conservatorship and receiving\nsignificant U.S. Government support, have sparked serious debate among federal policy makers regarding the continued role of the U.S.\nGovernment in providing liquidity for mortgage loans. In December 2011, Congress enacted the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut\nContinuation Act of 2011 which, among other provisions, requires that FNMA and FHLMC increase their single-family guaranty fees\nby at least 10 basis points and remit this increase to Treasury with respect to all loans acquired by FNMA and FHLMC on or after\nApril 1, 2012 and before January 1, 2022. Serious discussions among policymakers continue, however, as to whether FNMA and\nFHLMC should be nationalized, privatized, restructured, or eliminated altogether. FNMA reported in the second quarter of 2014 that\nthere was “significant uncertainty regarding the future of our company, including how long the company will continue to exist in its\ncurrent form, the extent of our role in the market, what form we will have, and what ownership interest, if any, our current common and\npreferred stockholders will hold in us after the conservatorship is terminated and whether we will continue to exist following\nconservatorship.” FHLMC faces similar uncertainty about its future role. FNMA and FHLMC also are the subject of several continuing\nlegal actions and investigations over certain accounting, disclosure or corporate governance matters, which (along with any resulting\nfinancial restatements) may continue to have an adverse effect on the guaranteeing entities.\nLending of Portfolio Securities\nIn seeking to earn additional income, the Fund may lend its portfolio securities to qualified parties (typically broker-dealers and\nbanks) who need to borrow securities in order to cover transactions into which they have entered. Any such loan must be continuously\nsecured by collateral in cash or cash equivalents maintained on a current basis in an amount at least equal to the market value of the\nsecurities loaned by the Fund. The Fund would continue to receive the equivalent of the interest or dividends paid by the issuer on the\nsecurities loaned, and would also receive an additional return that may be in the form of a fixed fee or a percentage of income earned on\nthe collateral. The Fund may experience losses as a result of a diminution in value of its cash collateral investments. The Fund may pay\nreasonable fees to persons unaffiliated with the Fund for services in arranging these loans. The Fund would have the right to call the\nloan and obtain the securities loaned at any time on notice of not less than five business days. The Fund would not have the right to vote\nthe securities during the existence of the loan; however, the Fund may attempt to call back the loan and vote the proxy if time permits\nprior to the record date. In the event of bankruptcy or other default of the borrower, the Fund could experience both delays in\nliquidating the loan collateral or recovering the loaned securities and losses, including (a) possible decline in the value of the collateral\nor in the value of the securities loaned during the period while the Fund seeks to enforce its rights thereto, (b) possible subnormal levels\nof income and lack of access to income during this period, and (c) expenses of enforcing its rights. In an effort to reduce these risks, the\nFund’s securities lending agent will monitor, and report to Calamos on, the creditworthiness of the firms to which the Fund lends\nsecurities.\n18\nPortfolio Turnover\nAlthough the Fund does not purchase securities with a view to rapid turnover, there are no limitations on the length of time that a\nportfolio security must be held. Portfolio turnover can occur for a number of reasons, including calls for redemption, general conditions\nin the securities markets, more favorable investment opportunities in other securities, or other factors relating to the desirability of\nholding or changing a portfolio investment. The portfolio turnover rates may vary greatly from year to year. A high rate of portfolio\nturnover in the Fund would result in increased transaction expense, which must be borne by the Fund. High portfolio turnover may also\nresult in the realization of capital gains or losses and, to the extent net short-term capital gains are realized, any distributions resulting\nfrom such gains will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nInterest Rate Transactions\nIn order to reduce the interest rate risk inherent in the Fund’s underlying investments and capital structure, the Fund, if market\nconditions are deemed favorable, may enter into interest rate swap or cap transactions. Fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps involve the\nFund’s agreement with the swap counterparty to pay a fixed rate payment in exchange for the counterparty agreeing to pay the Fund a\npayment at a variable rate that is expected to approximate the rate on any variable rate payment obligation on the Fund’s leverage. The\npayment obligations would be based on the notional amount of the swap. The Fund may use an interest rate cap, which would require it\nto pay a premium to the cap counterparty and would entitle it, to the extent that a specified variable rate index exceeds a predetermined\nfixed rate, to receive from the counterparty payment of the excess amount based on a stated notional amount. The Fund would use\ninterest rate swaps or caps only with the intent to reduce or eliminate the risk that an increase in short-term interest rates could have on\ncommon share net earnings as a result of leverage. There can be no assurance that the Fund will use interest rate transactions or that, if\nused, their use will be beneficial to the Fund.\nThe Fund will usually enter into swaps or caps on a net basis; that is, the two payment streams will be netted out in a cash\nsettlement on the payment date or dates specified in the instrument, with the Fund receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net\namount of the two payments. The Fund intends to maintain in a segregated account with its custodian cash or liquid securities having a\nvalue at least equal to the Fund’s net payment obligations under any swap transaction, marked-to-market daily.\nThe use of interest rate swaps and caps is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from\nthose associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. Depending on the state of interest rates in general, the Fund’s use of\ninterest rate swaps or caps could enhance or harm the overall performance on the common shares. To the extent there is a decline in\ninterest rates, the value of the interest rate swap or cap could decline, and could result in a decline in the net asset value of the common\nshares. In addition, if short-term interest rates are lower than the Fund’s fixed rate of payment on the interest rate swap, the swap will\nreduce common share net earnings. If, on the other hand, short-term interest rates are higher than the fixed rate of payment on the\ninterest rate swap, the swap will enhance common share net earnings. Buying interest rate caps could enhance the performance of the\ncommon shares by limiting certain leverage expenses. Buying interest rate caps could also decrease the net earnings of the common\nshares in the event that interest rates decline or stay the same or the premium paid by the Fund to the counterparty exceeds the\nadditional amount the Fund would have been required to pay had it not entered into the cap agreement. The Fund has no current\nintention of selling an interest rate swap or cap.\nInterest rate swaps and caps do not involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal. Accordingly, the risk\nof loss with respect to interest rate swaps is limited to the net amount of interest payments that the Fund is contractually obligated to\nmake or, if applicable, any premium paid by the Fund. If the counterparty defaults, the Fund would not be able to use the anticipated net\nreceipts under the swap or cap to offset the dividend or interest payments on the Fund’s leverage or offset certain losses in its portfolio.\nDepending on whether the Fund would be entitled to receive net payments from the counterparty on the swap or cap, which in turn\nwould depend on the general state of short-term interest rates at that point in time, such a default could negatively impact the\nperformance of the common shares.\nAlthough this will not guarantee that the counterparty does not default, the Fund will not enter into an interest rate swap or cap\ntransaction with any counter-party that Calamos believes does not have the financial resources to honor its obligation under the interest\nrate swap or cap transaction. Further, Calamos will continually monitor the\n19\nfinancial stability of a counterparty to an interest rate swap or cap transaction in an effort to proactively protect the Fund’s investments.\nIn addition, at the time the interest rate swap or cap transaction reaches its scheduled termination date, there is a risk that the Fund\nwould not be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that the terms of the replacement would not be as favorable as on the expiring\ntransaction. If this occurs, it could have a negative impact on the performance of the Fund’s common shares.\nIf the Fund were to issue preferred shares, the Fund may choose or be required to redeem some or all of the preferred shares or\nprepay any borrowings. Such redemption or prepayment would likely result in the Fund seeking to terminate early all or a portion of\nany swap or cap transaction. Such early termination of a swap could result in termination payment by or to the Fund.\nRisks Associated with Cleared Derivatives\nThe CFTC requires that certain interest rate swaps and index credit default swaps be cleared through a central counterparty\n(“CCP”) (unless an exception or exemption applies), and the CFTC may expand the types of swaps (e.g., certain foreign currency and\ncommodity swaps) subject to mandatory clearing. While the SEC has adopted rules establishing a framework for determining which\nsecurity-based swaps will be subject to mandatory clearing, no such clearing determination has been issued.\nWhere the Fund enters into swaps subject to mandatory clearing, it may be required to clear such swaps at a CCP through a FCM\nacting as clearing broker. The Fund will have to post initial margins to CCPs through FCMs or broker-dealers (in the U.S.) or other\nclearing brokers (outside the U.S.), and for swaps cleared at CCPs that are U.S.-registered derivatives clearing organizations, such\ninitial margins will be held by such CCP and FCMs in segregated accounts under the CFTC rules. Such segregation is intended to\nprotect the initial margins of swap clearing customers from the claims of other creditors of a CCP or FCM. Furthermore, the CFTC\nrules implement the so-called “legally segregated, operationally commingled” model for the segregation of swap clearing customer\ncollateral on a customer-by-customer basis, which is intended to protect each customer from the default of other customers of the FCM.\nSuch segregation, however, will not protect clearing customers like the Fund from any operational or fraud risk of a CCP or FCM with\nrespect to the initial margin posted to the CCP or FCM. In addition, the initial margins posted to a non-US CCP through a non-US\nclearing broker may not even be segregated from the property of such CCP and/or clearing broker. The SEC has no final rules for the\ntreatment and protection of customer property, including initial margins, held by CCPs and broker-dealers.\nIn addition, where the Fund enters into certain swaps subject to mandatory clearing, it may be required to execute such swaps on a\nregistered designated contract market or swap execution facility (“SEF”). The CFTC requires that certain interest rate swaps and index\ncredit default swaps be executed on a registered designated contract market or SEF, and registered designated contract markets or SEFs\nmay self-certify additional types of interest rate and index credit default swaps as subject to this requirement. The SEC not yet adopted\nregistration rules for security-based registered designated contract markets or SEFs or a mandatory trade execution requirement for\nsecurity-based swaps. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions may impose clearing and trade execution requirements that could apply\nto the Fund’s transactions with non-U.S. entities. While the Fund may benefit from reduced counterparty credit and operations risk and\npricing transparency resulting from these requirements, it will incur additional costs in trading these swaps. In addition, while the Fund\nwill attempt to execute, clear and settle these swaps through entities Calamos believes to be sound, there can be no assurance that a\nfailure by such an entity will not cause a loss to the Fund.\nRisks Associated with Uncleared Derivatives\nWhere the Fund enters into derivatives contracts that are not centrally cleared through a CCP, the Fund will become subject to the\nrisk that a counterparty will not perform its obligations under such contracts, either because of a dispute over the terms of the contract\n(whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem of the counterparty, thus causing the Fund to suffer a loss. Such\ncounterparty risk may be accentuated by the fact that the Fund may concentrate its transactions with a single or small group of\ncounterparties. In addition, in the case of a default, the Fund could become subject to adverse market movements while seeking\nreplacement transactions. The\n20\nFund is not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of its transactions with one\ncounterparty. Certain of the swap counterparties may be entities that are rated by recognized rating agencies. The Fund’s ability to\ntransact business with any one or number of counterparties, the possible lack of a meaningful and independent evaluation of such\ncounterparties’ financial capabilities, and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses\nby the Fund.\nThe U.S. prudential regulators and the CFTC have adopted margin requirements for non-cleared swaps which apply to entities\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the prudential regulators and entities registered as swap dealers with the CFTC, respectively (in each case,\nwith respect to all non-cleared swaps entered into on or after March 1, 2017). While the Fund will not be directly subject to these\nmargin requirements, the Fund will be indirectly impacted by the margin requirements where its counterparty is subject to such\nrequirement. The Fund is required to exchange variation margin (in the form of cash, certain highly liquid securities or gold) with its\ncounterparties that are subject to the margin requirement (and, if contractually agreed, with any other counterparty) to cover the\ncumulative daily mark-to-market change in value of the transaction since the last exchange of variation margin. The amount of margin\nthat must be posted and collected pursuant to these regulatory requirements may be determined on a net basis (taking into account\noffsetting exposures) with respect to a portfolio of uncleared swaps and/or security-based swaps that are governed by a master netting\nagreement that satisfies certain criteria. Mandatory initial margin requirements are also scheduled to become effective, but such\nrequirements apply only to swap dealers when trading with financial end users with “material swaps exposure.” Given the anticipated\nvolume of the Fund’s swap transactions, the Fund is not likely to have “material swaps exposure” for purposes of these margin rules,\nand therefore does not expect to be subject to these initial margin requirements. In addition, the U.S. prudential regulators’ margin rules\napply to non-cleared security-based swaps entered into by security-based swap dealers that are subject to their jurisdiction, and the SEC\nhas proposed but not yet adopted final margin rules for security-based swap dealers that are not subject to the jurisdiction of prudential\nregulators.\nTo the extent that the Fund’s swap dealer counterparty collects margin from the Fund on its uncleared swaps and security-based\nswaps, such margin is held in an account at the Fund’s custodian in which the swap dealer has a security interest. The custodian may\nfail to segregate such assets or collateral properly. In either case, in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of any custodian or\ncounterparty, the Fund’s assets and collateral may be subject to the conflicting claims of the creditors of the relevant custodian or\ncounterparty, and the Fund may be exposed to the risk of a court treating the Fund as a general unsecured creditor of such custodian or\ncounterparty, rather than as the owner of such assets or collateral.\nIn addition, uncleared OTC derivative instruments can generally be closed out only by negotiation with the counterparty, which\nmay expose the Fund to liquidity risk. There can be no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular derivative\ninstrument at any particular time, including for those derivative instruments that were originally categorized as liquid at the time they\nwere acquired by the Fund. In volatile markets, the Fund may not be able to close out a position without incurring a significant amount\nof loss. In addition, the Fund may not be able to convince its counterparty to consent to an early termination of an OTC derivative\ncontract or may not be able to enter into an offsetting transaction to effectively unwind the transaction. Such OTC derivative contracts\ngenerally are not assignable except by agreement between the parties, and a counterparty typically has no obligation to permit\nassignments. Even if the Fund’s counterparty agrees to early termination of OTC derivatives at any time, doing so may subject the Fund\nto certain early termination charges.\n“When Issued” and Delayed Delivery Securities and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nThe Fund may purchase securities on a when issued or delayed delivery basis. Although the payment and interest terms of these\nsecurities are established at the time the Fund enters into the commitment, the securities may be delivered and paid for a month or more\nafter the date of purchase, when their value may have changed. The Fund makes such commitments only with the intention of actually\nacquiring the securities, but may sell the securities before settlement date if Calamos deems it advisable for investment reasons. The\nFund may utilize spot and forward foreign currency exchange transactions to reduce the risk inherent in fluctuations in the exchange\nrate between one currency and another when securities are purchased or sold on a when issued or delayed delivery basis.\nThe Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements with banks and securities dealers. A reverse repurchase agreement is a\nrepurchase agreement in which the Fund is the seller of, rather than the investor in,\n21\nsecurities and agrees to repurchase them at an agreed upon time and price. Use of a reverse repurchase agreement may be preferable to a\nregular sale and later repurchase of securities because it avoids certain market risks and transaction costs. Reverse repurchase\nagreements involve the risk that the market value of securities and/or other instruments purchased by the Fund with the proceeds\nreceived by the Fund in connection with such reverse repurchase agreements may decline below the market value of the securities the\nFund is obligated to repurchase under such reverse repurchase agreements. They also involve the risk that the counterparty liquidates\nthe securities delivered to it by the Fund under the reverse repurchase agreement following the occurrence of an event of default under\nthe applicable master repurchase agreement by the Fund.\nAt the time when the Fund enters into a binding obligation to purchase securities on a when-issued basis or enters into a reverse\nrepurchase agreement, liquid securities (cash, U.S. Government securities or other “high grade” debt obligations) of the Fund having a\nvalue at least as great as the purchase price of the securities to be purchased will be segregated on the books of the Fund and held by the\ncustodian throughout the period of the obligation. The use of these investment strategies may increase net asset value fluctuation.\nTemporary Defensive Investments\nThe Fund may make temporary investments without limitation when Calamos determines that a defensive position is warranted.\nSuch investments may be in money market instruments, consisting of obligations of, or guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the\nU.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities; certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances and other obligations of domestic\nbanks having total assets of at least $500 million and that are regulated by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities;\ncommercial paper rated in the highest category by a recognized rating agency; cash; and repurchase agreements. If the Fund temporarily\nuses a different investment strategy for defensive purposes, different factors could affect the Fund’s performance, and the Fund may not\nachieve its investment objective.\nPreferred Shares\nThe Fund may invest in preferred shares. The preferred shares that the Fund will invest in will typically be convertible securities.\nPreferred shares are equity securities, but they have many characteristics of fixed income securities, such as a fixed dividend payment\nrate and/or a liquidity preference over the issuer’s common shares.\nOther Investment Companies (including ETFs)\nThe Fund may invest in the securities of other investment companies, including ETFs, to the extent that such investments are\nconsistent with the Fund’s investment objective and policies and permissible under the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund\ngenerally may not acquire the securities of other domestic or non-U.S. investment companies if, as a result, (i) more than 10% of the\nFund’s total assets would be invested in securities of other investment companies, (ii) such purchase would result in more than 3% of\nthe total outstanding voting securities of any one investment company being held by the Fund, or (iii) more than 5% of the Fund’s total\nassets would be invested in any one investment company. These limitations do not apply to the purchase of shares of money market\nfunds or any investment company in connection with a merger, consolidation, reorganization or acquisition of substantially all the assets\nof another investment company, or to purchases of investment companies done in accordance with SEC exemptive relief or rule.\nThe Fund, as a holder of the securities of other investment companies, will bear its pro rata portion of the other investment\ncompanies’ expenses, including advisory fees. These expenses are in addition to the direct expenses of the Fund’s own operations.\nRisks Associated with Zero Coupon and Payment-in-Kind Securities\nInvestments in zero coupon and payment-in-kind securities are subject to certain risks, including that market prices of zero coupon\nand payment-in-kind securities generally are more volatile than the prices of securities that pay interest periodically and in cash, and are\nlikely to respond to changes in interest rates to a greater degree than other types of debt securities with similar maturities and credit\nquality. Because zero coupon securities bear no interest, their prices are especially volatile. And because zero coupon bondholders do\nnot receive interest payments,\n22\nthe prices of zero coupon securities generally fall more dramatically than those of bonds that pay interest on a current basis when\ninterest rates rise. However, when interest rates fall, the prices of zero coupon securities generally rise more rapidly in value than those\nof similar interest paying bonds. Under many market and other conditions, the market for the zero coupon and payment-in-kind\nsecurities may suffer decreased liquidity making it difficult for the Fund to dispose of them or to determine their current value. In\naddition, as these securities may not pay cash interest, the Fund’s investment exposure to these securities and their risks, including\ncredit risk, will increase during the time these securities are held in the Fund’s portfolio. Further, to maintain its qualification for\ntreatment as a regulated investment company and to avoid Fund-level U.S. federal income and/or excise taxes, the Fund is required to\ndistribute to its shareholders any income it is deemed to have received in respect of such investments, notwithstanding that cash has not\nbeen received currently, and the value of paid-in-kind interest. Consequently, the Fund may have to dispose of portfolio securities under\ndisadvantageous circumstances to generate the cash, or may have to leverage itself by borrowing the cash to satisfy this distribution\nrequirement. The required distributions, if any, would result in an increase in the Fund’s exposure to these securities.\nDodd-Frank Act and Other Derivatives Regulations\nThe financial crisis in both the U.S. and global economies over the past several years, including the European sovereign debt\ncrisis, has resulted, and may continue to result, in an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets and the economy at\nlarge. Both domestic and international equity and fixed income markets have been experiencing heightened volatility and turmoil, with\nissuers that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage and credit markets particularly affected. It is uncertain how long these conditions\nwill continue.\nIn addition to the recent unprecedented turbulence in financial markets, the reduced liquidity in credit and fixed income markets\nmay negatively affect many issuers worldwide. Reduced liquidity in these markets may mean there is less money available to purchase\nraw materials, goods and services, which may, in turn, bring down the prices of these economic staples. It may also result in some\nissuers having more difficulty obtaining financing and ultimately may lead to a decline in their stock prices. The values of some\nsovereign debt and of securities of issuers that hold that sovereign debt have fallen. These events, and the potential for continuing\nmarket turbulence, may have an adverse effect on the Fund. In addition, global economies and financial markets are becoming\nincreasingly interconnected, which increases the possibilities that conditions in one country or region might adversely impact issuers in\na different country or region.\nContinuing uncertainty as to the status of the Euro and the European Monetary Union (“EMU”) and the potential for certain\ncountries to withdraw from the institution has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets generally. Any partial or\ncomplete dissolution of the EMU could have significant adverse effects on currency and financial markets, and on the values of the\nFund’s portfolio investments.\nThe U.S. federal government and certain foreign central banks have acted to calm credit markets and increase confidence in the\nU.S. and world economies. Certain of these entities have injected liquidity into the markets and taken other steps in an effort to stabilize\nthe markets and grow the economy. The ultimate effect of these efforts is, of course, not yet known. Changes in government policies\nmay exacerbate the market’s difficulties and the withdrawal of this support, or other policy changes by governments or central banks,\ncould negatively affect the value and liquidity of certain securities.\nThe situation in the financial markets has resulted in calls for for increased regulation, and the need of many financial institutions\nfor government help has given lawmakers and regulators new leverage. The Dodd-Frank Act initiated a dramatic revision of the U.S.\nfinancial regulatory framework that is expected to continue to unfold over several years. The Dodd-Frank Act covers a broad range of\ntopics, including (among many others) a reorganization of federal financial regulators; a process intended to improve financial systemic\nstability and the resolution of potentially insolvent financial firms; new rules for derivatives trading; the creation of the Consumer\nFinancial Protection Bureau; the registration and additional regulation of hedge and private equity fund managers; and new federal\nrequirements for residential mortgage loans. Instruments in which the Fund may invest, or the issuers of such instruments, may be\naffected by the new legislation and regulation in ways that may be unforeseeable. Because these requirements are new and evolving\n(and some of the rules are not yet final), their ultimate impact remains unclear.\n23\nThe statutory provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act significantly change in several respects the ways in which investment products are\nmarketed, sold, settled or terminated. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates the elimination of references to credit ratings in\nnumerous securities laws, including the 1940 Act. Transactions in some types of swaps (including interest rate swaps and credit default\nindex swaps on North American and European indices) are required to be centrally cleared. Clearinghouses and futures commission\nmerchants have broad rights to increase margin requirements for existing cleared transactions or to terminate cleared transactions at any\ntime. Any increase in margin requirements or termination by the clearing member or the clearinghouse may have an effect on the\nperformance of the Fund.\nUnder rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act, certain derivatives contracts are required to be executed through swap execution\nfacilities (“SEFs”). A SEF is a trading platform where multiple market participants can execute derivatives by accepting bids and offers\nmade by multiple other participants in the platform. Such requirements may make it more difficult and costly for investment funds, such\nas the Fund, to enter into highly tailored or customized transactions. Trading swaps on a SEF may offer certain advantages over\ntraditional bilateral over-the-counter trading, such as ease of execution, price transparency, increased liquidity and/or favorable pricing.\nExecution through a SEF is not, however, without additional costs and risks, as parties are required to comply with SEF and CFTC rules\nand regulations, including disclosure and recordkeeping obligations, and SEF rights of inspection, among others. SEFs typically charge\nfees, and if the Fund executes derivatives on a SEF through a broker intermediary, the intermediary may impose fees as well. The Fund\nalso may be required to indemnify a SEF, or a broker intermediary who executes swaps on a SEF on the Fund’s behalf, against any\nlosses or costs that may be incurred as a result of the Fund’s transactions on the SEF. In addition, the Fund may be subject to execution\nrisk if it enters into a derivatives transaction that is required to be cleared, and no clearing member is willing to clear the transaction on\nthe Fund’s behalf. In that case, the transaction might have to be terminated, and the Fund could lose some or all of the benefit of any\nincrease in the value of the transaction after the time of the trade.\nThe European Union (and some other countries) are implementing similar requirements that will affect the Fund when it enters\ninto derivatives transactions with a counterparty organized in that country or otherwise subject to that country’s derivatives regulations.\nThe new requirements may result in increased uncertainty about counterparty credit risk, and they may also limit the flexibility of\nthe Fund to protect its interests in the event of an insolvency of a derivatives counterparty. In the event of a counterparty’s (or its\naffiliate’s) insolvency, the Fund’s ability to exercise remedies, such as the termination of transactions, netting of obligations and\nrealization on collateral, could be stayed or eliminated under new special resolution regimes adopted in the United States, the European\nUnion and various other jurisdictions. Such regimes provide government authorities with broad authority to intervene when a financial\ninstitution is experiencing financial difficulty. In particular, with respect to counterparties who are subject to such proceedings in the\nEuropean Union, the liabilities of such counterparties to the Fund could be reduced, eliminated, or converted to equity in such\ncounterparties (sometimes referred to as a “bail in”).\nAdditionally, U.S. regulators, the European Union and certain other jurisdictions have adopted minimum margin and capital\nrequirements for uncleared derivatives transactions. It is expected that these regulations will have a material impact on the Fund’s use of\nuncleared derivatives. These rules will impose minimum margin requirements on derivatives transactions between the Fund and its\nswap counterparties and may increase the amount of margin the Fund is required to provide. They will impose regulatory requirements\non the timing of transferring margin. The Fund is subject to variation margin requirements under such rules and the Fund may become\nsubject to initial margin requirements under such rules in 2020.\nThese and other new rules and regulations could, among other things, further restrict the Fund’s ability to engage in, or increase\nthe cost to the Fund of, derivatives transactions, for example, by making some types of derivatives no longer available to the Fund or\notherwise limiting liquidity.\nBecause the situation in the markets is widespread and largely unprecedented, it may be unusually difficult to identify both risks\nand opportunities using past models of the interplay of market forces, or to predict the duration of these market conditions.\n24\nINVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\nThe following are the Fund’s fundamental investment restrictions. These restrictions may not be changed without the approval of\nthe holders of a majority of the Fund’s outstanding voting securities (which for this purpose and under the 1940 Act means the lesser of\n(i) 67% of the common shares represented at a meeting at which more than 50% of the outstanding common shares are represented or\n(ii) more than 50% of the outstanding common shares). If the Fund issues preferred shares are outstanding, the investment restrictions\ncould not be changed without the approval of a majority of the outstanding common and preferred shares, voting together as a class, and\nthe approval of a majority of the outstanding preferred shares, voting separately by class.\nThe Fund may not:\n(1) Issue senior securities, except as permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and interpretive positions of the SEC thereunder.\n(2) Borrow money, except as permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and interpretive positions of the SEC thereunder.\n(3) Invest in real estate, except that the Fund may invest in securities of issuers that invest in real estate or interests therein,\nsecurities that are secured by real estate or interests therein, securities of real estate investment funds and mortgage-backed\nsecurities.\n(4) Make loans, except by the purchase of debt obligations, by entering into repurchase agreements or through the lending of\nportfolio securities and as otherwise permitted by the 1940 Act and the rules and interpretive positions of the SEC\nthereunder.\n(5) Invest in physical commodities or contracts relating to physical commodities.\n(6) Act as an underwriter, except as it may be deemed to be an underwriter in a sale of securities held in its portfolio.\n(7) Make any investment inconsistent with the Fund’s classification as a diversified investment company under the 1940 Act\nand the rules and interpretive positions of the SEC thereunder.\n(8) Concentrate its investments in securities of companies in any particular industry or group of industries as defined in the\n1940 Act and the rules and interpretive positions of the SEC thereunder.\nAll other investment policies of the Fund are considered non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board of Trustees without\nprior approval of the Fund’s outstanding voting shares.\nCurrently under the 1940 Act, the Fund is not permitted to issue senior securities representing indebtedness unless immediately\nafter such borrowing the Fund has asset coverage of at least 300% of the aggregate outstanding principal balance of indebtedness (i.e.,\nsuch indebtedness may not exceed 33 1/ % of the value of the Fund’s managed assets). Currently under the 1940 Act, the Fund is not\n3\npermitted to issue preferred shares unless immediately after such issuance the net asset value of the Fund’s portfolio is at least 200% of\nthe liquidation value of the outstanding preferred shares (i.e., such liquidation value may not exceed 50% of the value of the Fund’s\nmanaged assets). In addition, currently under the 1940 Act, the Fund is not permitted to declare any cash dividend or other distribution\non its common shares unless, at the time of such declaration, the net asset value of the Fund’s portfolio (determined after deducting the\namount of such dividend or distribution) is at least 200% of such liquidation value plus any senior securities representing indebtedness.\nAdditionally, currently under the 1940 Act, the Fund generally may not declare any dividend or other distribution upon any class of its\nshares, or purchase any such shares, unless the aggregate indebtedness of the Fund has, at the time of the declaration of any such\ndividend or distribution or at the time of any such purchase, an asset coverage of at least 300% after deducting the amount of such\ndividend, distribution, or purchase price, as the case may be.\nCurrently under the 1940 Act, the Fund is not permitted to lend money or property to any person, directly or indirectly, if such\nperson controls or is under common control with the Fund, except for a loan from the Fund to a company which owns all of the\noutstanding securities of the Fund, except directors’ qualifying shares.\n25\nCurrently, under interpretive positions of the SEC staff, the Fund may not have on loan at any time securities representing more\nthan one third of its total assets.\nCurrently under the 1940 Act, a “senior security” does not include any promissory note or evidence of indebtedness where such\nloan is for temporary purposes only and in an amount not exceeding 5% of the value of the total assets of the issuer at the time the loan\nis made. A loan is presumed to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within sixty days and is not extended or renewed.\nCurrently, the Fund would be deemed to “concentrate” in a particular industry if it invested 25% or more of its total assets in that\nindustry.\nCurrently under the 1940 Act, a “diversified company” means a management company which meets the following requirements:\nat least 75% of the value of its total assets is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), government securities,\nsecurities of other investment companies, and other securities for the purposes of this calculation limited in respect of any one issuer to\nan amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of the total assets of such management company and not more than 10% of the\noutstanding voting securities of such issuer.\nUnder the 1940 Act, the Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in the aggregate in shares of other investment companies\nand up to 5% of its total assets in any one investment company, provided the investment does not represent more than 3% of the voting\nstock of the acquired investment company at the time such shares are purchased. These limitations, however, do not apply to the\npurchase of shares of money market funds or any investment company in connection with a merger, consolidation, reorganization or\nacquisition of substantially all the assets of another investment company, or to purchases of investment companies done in accordance\nwith SEC exemptive relief or rule. As a shareholder in any investment company, the Fund will bear its ratable share of that investment\ncompany’s expenses, and would remain subject to payment of the Fund’s advisory fees and other expenses with respect to assets so\ninvested. Holders of common shares would therefore be subject to duplicative expenses to the extent the Fund invests in other\ninvestment companies. In addition, the securities of other investment companies may also be leveraged and will therefore be subject to\nthe same leverage risks described herein and in the prospectus. As described in the prospectus in the section entitled “Risks,” the net\nasset value and market value of leveraged shares will be more volatile and the yield to shareholders will tend to fluctuate more than the\nyield generated by unleveraged shares.\nIn addition, to comply with federal income tax requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company, the Fund’s\ninvestments will be limited by both an income and an asset test. See “Certain Federal Income Tax Matters.”\nAs a non-fundamental policy, the Fund may not issue debt securities, borrow money or issue preferred shares in an aggregate\namount exceeding 38% of the Fund’s total assets measured at the time of issuance of the new securities. Investments of short sale\nproceeds and economic leverage through derivatives are not considered borrowings.\nThe Fund has not adopted a fundamental policy prohibiting or limiting the Fund’s use of short sales, purchases on margin and the\nwriting of put and call options. The Fund is subject, however, to the limitations on its use of these investments under the 1940 Act and\nthe rules and interpretive positions of the SEC under the 1940 Act. Under current law, the Fund may not purchase securities on margin.\nMANAGEMENT OF THE FUND\nTrustees and Officers\nThe Fund’s Board of Trustees provides broad oversight over the Fund’s affairs. Following our initial public offering, the officers\nof the Fund will be responsible for the Fund’s operations.

In accordance with the Fund’s Declaration of Trust, the Board of\nTrustees is divided into three classes of approximately equal size. The terms of the trustees of the different classes are staggered. The\nterms of John P. Calamos, Sr. and William R. Rybak will expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2020. The terms of John E.\nNeal and David D. Tripple will expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2021. The terms of Virginia G. Breen, Stephen B.\nTimbers, and Lloyd A. Wennlund will expire at the annual meeting of shareholders in 2022. Such classification of the Trustees may\nprevent the replacement of a majority of the Trustees for up to a two-year period. Each of the Fund’s officers serves until his or her\nsuccessor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal by the Board of Trustees.\n29\nCommittees of the Board of Trustees. The Fund’s Board of Trustees has formed five standing committees:\nExecutive Committee. Messrs. Calamos, Sr. and Neal are members of the Executive Committee, which has authority during\nintervals between meetings of the Board of Trustees to exercise the powers of the Board, with certain exceptions.\nAudit Committee. Messrs. Timbers, Neal, Rybak (Chair), Tripple, and Wennlund, and Ms. Breen, each an Independent Trustee,\nserve on the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee approves the selection of the independent auditors to the Trustees, approves\nservices to be rendered by the auditors, monitors the auditors’ performance, reviews the results of the Fund’s audit, determines whether\nto recommend to the Board that the Fund’s audited financial statements be included in the Fund’s annual report and responds to other\nmatters deemed appropriate by the Board of Trustees.\nGovernance Committee. Messrs. Timbers, Neal, Rybak, Tripple, and Wennlund, and Ms. Breen (Chair), each an Independent\nTrustee, serve on the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee oversees the independence and effective functioning of the\nBoard of Trustees and endeavors to be informed about good practices for fund boards. The members of the Governance Committee\nmake recommendations to the Board of Trustees regarding candidates for election as non-interested Trustees. The Governance\nCommittee will consider shareholder recommendations regarding potential candidates for nomination as Trustees properly submitted to\nthe Governance Committee for its consideration. A Fund shareholder who wishes to nominate a candidate to the Fund’s Board of\nTrustees must submit any such recommendation in writing via regular mail to the attention of the Fund’s Secretary, at the address of the\nFund’s principal executive offices. The shareholder recommendation must include:\n• the number and class of all Fund shares owned beneficially and of record by the nominating shareholder at the time the\nrecommendation is submitted and the dates on which such shares were acquired, specifying the number of shares owned\nbeneficially;\n• a full listing of the proposed candidate’s education, experience (including knowledge of the investment company industry,\nexperience as a director or senior officer of public or private companies, and directorships on other boards of other\nregistered investment companies), current employment, date of birth, business and residence address, and the names and\naddresses of at least three professional references;\n• information as to whether the candidate is, has been or may be an “interested person” (as such term is defined in the\n1940 Act) of the Fund, Calamos or any of its affiliates, and, if believed not to be or have been an “interested person,”\ninformation regarding the candidate that will be sufficient for the Committee to make such determination;\n• the written and signed consent of the candidate to be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee of the Fund, if elected;\n• a description of all arrangements or understandings between the nominating shareholder, the candidate and/or any other\nperson or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the shareholder recommendation is being made, and if none, so\nspecify;\n• the class or series and number of all shares of the Fund owned of record or beneficially by the candidate, as reported by the\ncandidate; and\n• such other information as would be helpful to the Governance Committee in evaluating the candidate.\nThe Governance Committee may require the nominating shareholder to furnish other information it may reasonably require or\ndeem necessary to verify any information furnished pursuant to the procedures delineated above or to determine the qualifications and\neligibility of the candidate proposed by the nominating shareholder to serve as a Trustee. If the nominating shareholder fails to provide\nsuch additional information in writing within seven days of receipt of a written request from the Governance Committee, the\nrecommendation of such candidate as a nominee will be deemed not properly submitted for consideration, and the Governance\nCommittee is not required to consider such candidate.\nUnless otherwise specified by the governance committee’s chairman or by legal counsel to the non-interested trustees, the Trust’s\nSecretary will promptly forward all shareholder recommendations to the governance committee’s chairman and the legal counsel to\nthe non-interested trustees, indicating whether the shareholder\n30\nrecommendation has been properly submitted pursuant to the procedures adopted by the governance committee for the consideration of\ntrustee candidates nominated by shareholders.\nRecommendations for candidates as trustees will be evaluated, among other things, in light of whether the number of trustees is\nexpected to change and whether the trustees expect any vacancies. During periods when the Governance Committee is not actively\nrecruiting new Trustees, shareholder recommendations will be kept on file until active recruitment is under way. After consideration of\na shareholder recommendation, the Governance Committee may dispose of the shareholder recommendation.\nDividend Committee. Mr. Calamos, Sr. serves as the sole member of the dividend committee and Mr. Neal serves as the liaison to\nthe Dividend Committee for the Independent Trustees. The Dividend Committee is authorized to declare distributions on the Fund’s\nshares including, but not limited to, regular dividends, special dividends and short- and long-term capital gains distributions.\nValuation Committee. Messrs. Timbers, Neal, Rybak, Tripple, and Wennlund (Chair), and Ms. Breen, each\na non-interested Trustee, serve on the Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee is responsible for overseeing the implementation\nof the valuation procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. The members of the Valuation Committee will make recommendations to\nthe Board of Trustees regarding valuation matters relating to the Fund.\nIn addition to the above committees, there is a Board of Trustees-directed pricing committee comprised of officers of the Fund and\nemployees of Calamos.\nThe Fund’s Declaration of Trust provides that the Fund will indemnify the Trustees and officers against liabilities and expenses\nincurred in connection with any claim in which they may be involved because of their offices with the Fund, unless it is determined in\nthe manner specified in the Declaration of Trust that they have not acted in good faith in the reasonable belief that their actions were in\nthe best interests of the Fund or that such indemnification would relieve any officer or Trustee of any liability to the Fund or its\nshareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his or her duties.\nLeadership Structure and Qualifications of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is responsible for oversight of the Fund.\nThe Fund has engaged Calamos to manage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The Board of Trustees oversees Calamos and certain other\nprincipal service providers in the operations of the Fund. The Board of Trustees is currently composed of seven members, six of whom\nare Independent Trustees. The Board of Trustees plans to meet in-person at regularly scheduled meetings four times throughout the\nyear. In addition, the Board may meet in-person or by telephone at special meetings or on an informal basis at other times. As described\nabove, the Board of Trustees has established five standing committees — Audit, Dividend, Executive, Governance and Valuation —\nand may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time, to assist the Board of Trustees in fulfilling its oversight\nresponsibilities. The Independent Trustees also have engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities.\nSuch independent legal counsel also serves as counsel to the Fund.\nThe chairman of the Board of Trustees is an “interested person” of the Fund (as such term is defined in the 1940 Act). The\nIndependent Trustees have appointed a lead independent trustee. The lead Independent Trustee serves as a liaison between Calamos and\nthe Independent Trustees and leads the Independent Trustees in all aspects of their oversight of the Fund. Among other things, the lead\nIndependent Trustee will review and approve, with the chairman, the agenda for each board and committee meeting and facilitate\ncommunication among the Fund’s Independent Trustees. The Trustees believe that the Board’s leadership structure is appropriate given\nthe characteristics and circumstances of the Fund. The Trustees also believe that this structure facilitates the exercise of the Board’s\nindependent judgment in fulfilling its oversight function and efficiently allocates responsibility among committees.\nThe Board of Trustees has concluded that, based on each Trustee’s experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual\nbasis and in combination with those of the other Trustees, each Trustee should serve as a member of the Board. In making this\ndetermination, the Board has considered each Trustee’s background and experience, including prior service as members of the Board of\nthe Calamos Funds. Set forth below is a brief\n31\ndiscussion of the specific experience qualifications, attributes or skills of each Trustee that led the Board to conclude that he should\nserve as a Trustee.\nEach of Messrs. Calamos, Sr., Neal, Rybak, Timbers, Tripple and Wennlund, and Ms. Breen has more than 25 years of experience\nin the financial services industry. Each of Messrs. Calamos, Sr., Neal, Rybak, Timbers, Tripple and Wennlund, and Ms. Breen has\nexperience serving on boards of other entities, including other investment companies. Each of Messrs. Calamos, Sr., Neal, Rybak and\nTimbers and Ms. Breen has earned a Masters of Business Administration degree, and Mr. Tripple has earned a Juris Doctor degree.\nRisk Oversight. The operation of a registered investment company, including its investment activities, generally involves a variety\nof risks. As part of its oversight of the Fund, the Board of Trustees will oversee risk through various regular board and committee\nactivities. The Board of Trustees, directly or through its committees, will review reports from, among others, Calamos, the Fund’s\nCompliance Officer, the Fund’s independent registered public accounting firm, independent outside legal counsel, and internal auditors\nof Calamos or its affiliates, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and the risk management programs of Calamos and certain\nservice providers. The actual day-to-day risk management with respect to the Fund will reside with Calamos and other service providers\nto the Fund. Although the risk management policies of Calamos and the service providers are designed to be effective, there is no\nguarantee that they will anticipate or mitigate all risks. Not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified, eliminated or mitigated\nand some risks simply may not be anticipated or may be beyond the control of the Board of Trustees or Calamos, its affiliates or other\nservice providers.\nCompensation of Officers and Trustees. John P. Calamos, Sr., the trustee who is an “interested person” of the Fund, does not\nreceive compensation from the Fund. Non-interested trustees are compensated by the Fund, but do not receive any pension or retirement\nbenefits from the Fund. Mr. Mickey, the Fund’s Chief Compliance Officer, is the only Fund officer who receives compensation from\nthe Fund. The following table sets forth the total estimated compensation (including any amounts deferred, as described below) paid by\nthe Calamos Fund Complex during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 to each of the current Independent Trustees and the one\nofficer compensated by the Fund.\nAggregate Compensation Total Compensation From\nName of Trustee From Fund** Calamos Fund Complex*\nJohn P. Calamos Sr. $ 0 $ 0\nVirginia G. Breen $ 0 $ 140,000\nJohn E. Neal(1) $ 0 $ 182,000\nWilliam R. Rybak $ 0 $ 157,000\nStephen B. Timbers $ 0 $ 187,000\nDavid D. Tripple $ 0 $ 157,000\nLloyd A. Wennlund (2) $ 0 $ 75,000\nMark J. Mickey $ 0 $ 150,000\n(1) Includes fees that may have been deferred during the year pursuant to a deferred compensation plan with Calamos Investment\nTrust. Deferred amounts are treated as though such amounts have been invested and reinvested in shares of one or more of the\nportfolios of the Calamos Investment Trust selected by the Trustee. As of October 31, 2018, the value of the deferred\ncompensation account of Mr. Neal was $1,785,811.\n(2) Mr. Wennlund was elected to the Board effective July 19, 2018.\n* The Calamos Fund Complex consists of nine investment companies and each applicable series thereunder including the Fund,\nCalamos Investment Trust, Calamos Advisors Trust, Calamos Global Total Return Fund, Calamos Convertible and High Income\nFund, Calamos Strategic Total Return Fund, Calamos Convertible Opportunities and Income Fund, Calamos Global Dynamic\nIncome Fund and Calamos Dynamic Convertible and Income Fund.\n** During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Fund had not commenced operations.\nThe compensation paid to the non-interested trustees of Calamos Funds for their services as such consists of an annual retainer fee\nin the amount of $91,000, with annual supplemental retainers of $40,000 to the lead independent trustee, $20,000 to the chair of the\naudit committee and $10,000 to the chair of any other committee.\n32\nEach non-interested trustee receives a meeting attendance fee of $7,000 for any regular or special board meeting attended in person,\n$3,500 for any regular or special board meeting attended by telephone and $3,000 for any committee meeting attended in person or by\ntelephone. Compensation paid to the Independent Trustees is allocated among the series of the Calamos Funds in accordance with a\nprocedure determined from time to time by the Board.\nThe Fund has adopted a deferred compensation plan for Independent Trustees (the “Plan”). Under the Plan, a trustee who is not an\n“interested person” of Calamos and has elected to participate in the Plan (“a participating trustee”) may defer receipt of all or a portion\nof his compensation from the Fund in order to defer payment of income taxes or for other reasons. The deferred compensation payable\nto the participating trustee is credited to the trustee’s deferral account as of the business day such otherwise compensation would have\nbeen paid to the trustee. The value of a trustee’s deferred compensation account at any time is equal to what the value if the amounts\ncredited to the account had instead been invested in Class I shares of one or more of the portfolios of Calamos Investment Trust as\ndesignated by the trustee. Thus, the value of the account increases with contributions to the account or with increases in the value of the\nmeasuring shares, and the value of the account decreases with withdrawals from the account or with declines in the value of the\nmeasuring shares. If a participating trustee retires, the trustee may elect to receive payments under the plan in a lump sum or in equal\nannual installments over a period of five years. If a participating trustee dies, any amount payable under the Plan will be paid to the\ntrustee’s beneficiaries. Each Calamos Fund’s obligation to make payments under the Plan is a general obligation of that Fund. No Fund\nis liable for any other Fund’s obligations to make payments under the Plan.\nOwnership of Shares of the Fund and Other Calamos Funds. The following table indicates the value of shares that each Trustee\nbeneficially owns in the Fund and the Calamos Fund Complex in the aggregate. The value of shares of the Calamos Funds is\ndetermined on the basis of the net asset value of the class of shares held as of August 31, 2019. The value of the shares held are stated in\nranges in accordance with the requirements of the SEC. The table reflects the Trustee’s beneficial ownership of shares of the Calamos\nFund Complex. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC.\nAggregate Dollar Range of Equity\nSecurities in all Registered\nDollar Range of Equity Investment Companies in the\nName of Trustee Securities in the Fund* Calamos Funds\nJohn P.

As a result, these amounts reflect any holdings of those entities in addition to the individual, personal accounts of\nJohn P. Calamos, Sr.\n(2) Indicates an “interested person” of the Trust, as defined in the 1940 Act.\n(3) Mr. Wennlund was elected to the Board effective July 19, 2018.\n* As of August 31, 2019, the Fund had not commenced operations.\nCode of Ethics. The Fund and Calamos have adopted a code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act which is applicable to\nofficers, directors/Trustees and designated employees of Calamos and CFS. Employees of Calamos and CFS are permitted to make\npersonal securities transactions, including transactions in securities that the Fund may purchase, sell or hold, subject to requirements\nand restrictions set forth in the code of ethics of Calamos and CFS. The code of ethics contains provisions and requirements designed to\nidentify and address certain conflicts of interest between personal investment activities of Calamos and CFS employees and the interests\nof investment advisory clients such as the Fund. Among other things, the code of ethics prohibits certain types of transactions\n33\nabsent prior approval, imposes time periods during which personal transactions may not be made in certain securities, and requires the\nsubmission of duplicate broker confirmations and statements and quarterly reporting of securities transactions. Additional restrictions\napply to portfolio managers, traders, research analysts and others involved in the investment advisory process. Exceptions to these and\nother provisions of the code of ethics may be granted in particular circumstances after review by appropriate personnel. Text-only\nversions of the code of ethics can be viewed online or downloaded from the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s internet website\nat www.sec.gov.\nProxy Voting Procedures. The Fund has delegated proxy voting responsibilities to Calamos, subject to the Board of Trustees’\ngeneral oversight. The Fund expects Calamos to vote proxies related to the Fund’s portfolio securities for which the Fund has voting\nauthority consistent with the Fund’s best economic interests. Calamos has adopted its own Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures\n(“Policies”). The Policies address, among other things, conflicts of interest that may arise between the interests of the Fund, and the\ninterests of the adviser and its affiliates.\nThe following is a summary of the Policies used by Calamos in voting proxies.\nTo assist it in voting proxies, Calamos has established a Committee comprised of members of its Portfolio Management and\nResearch Departments. The Committee and/or its members will vote proxies using the following guidelines.\nIn general, if Calamos believes that a company’s management and board have interests sufficiently aligned with the Fund’s\ninterest, Calamos will vote in favor of proposals recommended by a company’s board. More specifically, Calamos seeks to ensure that\nthe board of directors of a company is sufficiently aligned with security holders’ interests and provides proper oversight of the\ncompany’s management. In many cases this may be best accomplished by having a majority of independent board members. Although\nCalamos will examine board member elections on a case-by-case basis, it will generally vote for the election of directors that would\nresult in a board comprised of a majority of independent directors.\nBecause of the enormous variety and complexity of transactions that are presented to shareholders, such as mergers, acquisitions,\nreincorporations, adoptions of anti-takeover measures (including adoption of a shareholder rights plan, requiring supermajority voting\non particular issues, adoption of fair price provisions, issuance of blank check preferred stocks and the creation of a separate class of\nstock with unequal voting rights), changes to capital structures (including authorizing additional shares, repurchasing stock or approving\na stock split), executive compensation and option plans, that occur in a variety of industries, companies and market cycles, it is\nextremely difficult to foresee exactly what would be in the best interests of the Fund in all circumstances. Moreover, voting on such\nproposals involves considerations unique to each transaction. Accordingly, Calamos will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals\npresenting these transactions.\nFinally, Calamos has established procedures to help resolve conflicts of interests that might arise when voting proxies for the\nFund. These procedures provide that the Committee, along with Calamos’ Legal and Compliance Departments, will examine conflicts\nof interests with the Fund of which Calamos is aware and seek to resolve such conflicts in the best interests of the Fund, irrespective of\nany such conflict. If a member of the Committee has a personal conflict of interest, that member will refrain from voting and the\nremainder of the Committee will determine how to vote the proxy solely on the investment merits of any proposal. The Committee will\nthen memorialize the conflict and the procedures used to address the conflict.\nThe Fund is required to file with the SEC its complete proxy voting record for the twelve-month period ending June 30, by no\nlater than August 31 of each year. The Fund’s proxy voting record for the most recent twelve-month period ending June 30 will be\navailable by August 31 of each year (1) on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and (2) without charge, upon request, by\ncalling 1-800-582-6959.\nYou may obtain a copy of Calamos’ Policies by calling 1-800-582-6959, by visiting the Fund’s website at www.calamos.com, by\nwriting Calamos at: Calamos Investments, Attn: Client Services, 2020 Calamos Court, Naperville, IL 60563, and on the SEC’s website\nat www.sec.gov.\n34\nInvestment Adviser and Investment Management Agreement\nSubject to the overall supervision and review of the Board of Trustees, Calamos will regularly provide the Fund with investment\nresearch, advice and supervision and following our initial public offering will furnish continuously an investment program for the Fund,\nconsistent with the investment objective and policies of the Fund. In addition, Calamos furnishes for use of the Fund such office space\nand facilities as the Fund may require for its reasonable needs, supervises the Fund’s business and affairs and provides or will provide\nthe following other services on behalf of the Fund (not provided by persons not a party to the investment management agreement):\n(a) preparing or assisting in the preparation of reports to and meeting materials for the Trustees; (b) supervising, negotiating contractual\narrangements with, to the extent appropriate, and monitoring the performance of, accounting agents, custodians, depositories, transfer\nagents and pricing agents, accountants, attorneys, printers, underwriters, brokers and dealers, insurers and other persons in any capacity\ndeemed to be necessary or desirable to Fund operations; (c) assisting in the preparation and making of filings with the SEC and other\nregulatory and self-regulatory organizations, including, but not limited to, preliminary and definitive proxy materials, this registration\nstatement on Form N-2 and any amendments hereto, and reports on Form N-CEN and Form N-CSR; (d) overseeing the tabulation of\nproxies by the Fund’s transfer agent; (e) assisting in the preparation and filing of the Fund’s federal, state and local tax returns;\n(f) assisting in the preparation and filing of the Fund’s federal excise tax returns pursuant to Section 4982 of the Code; (g) providing\nassistance with investor and public relations matters; (h) monitoring the valuation of portfolio securities and the calculation of net asset\nvalue; (i) monitoring the registration of shares of beneficial interest of the Fund under applicable federal and state securities laws;\n(j) maintaining or causing to be maintained for the Fund all books, records and reports and any other information required under the\n1940 Act, to the extent that such books, records and reports and other information are not maintained by the Fund’s custodian or other\nagents of the Fund; (k) assisting in establishing the accounting policies of the Fund; (l) assisting in the resolution of accounting issues\nthat may arise with respect to the Fund’s operations and consulting with the Fund’s independent accountants, legal counsel and the\nFund’s other agents as necessary in connection therewith; (m) reviewing the Fund’s bills; (n) assisting the Fund in determining the\namount of dividends and distributions available to be paid by the Fund to its shareholders, preparing and arranging for the printing of\ndividend notices to shareholders, and providing the transfer and dividend paying agent, the custodian, and the accounting agent with\nsuch information as is required for such parties to effect the payment of dividends and distributions; and (o) otherwise assisting the\nFund as it may reasonably request in the conduct of the Fund’s business, subject to the direction and control of the Trustees.\nUnder the investment management agreement, the Fund has agreed to pay to Calamos a fee based on the Fund’s average weekly\nmanaged assets that is computed weekly and paid on a monthly basis in arrears. The fee to be paid by the Fund is set at the annual rate\nof 1.35% of Fund’s average weekly managed assets. Because the fees to be paid to Calamos will be determined on the basis of the\nFund’s managed assets, the amount of management fees paid to Calamos when the Fund uses leverage will be higher than if the Fund\ndid not use leverage. Therefore, Calamos has a financial incentive to use leverage, which creates a conflict of interest between Calamos\nand the Fund’s common shareholders.\nUnder the terms of its investment management agreement, except for the services and facilities provided by Calamos as set forth\ntherein, the Fund will assume and pay all expenses for all other Fund operations and activities and will reimburse Calamos for any such\nexpenses incurred by Calamos. The expenses borne by the Fund will include, without limitation: (a) organizational expenses of the\nFund (including out-of-pocket expenses, but not including Calamos’ overhead or employee costs); (b) fees payable to Calamos;\n(c) legal expenses; (d) auditing and accounting expenses; (e) maintenance of books and records that are required to be maintained by the\nFund’s custodian or other agents of the Fund; (f) telephone, telex, facsimile, postage and other communications expenses; (g) taxes and\ngovernmental fees; (h) fees, dues and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with membership in investment company trade\norganizations and the expense of attendance at professional meetings of such organizations; (i) fees and expenses of accounting agents,\ncustodians, sub-custodians, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents and registrars; (j) payment for portfolio pricing or valuation\nservices to pricing agents, accountants, bankers and other specialists, if any; (k) expenses of preparing share certificates; (l) expenses in\nconnection with the issuance, offering, distribution, sale, redemption or repurchase of securities issued by the Fund; (m) expenses\nrelating to investor and public relations provided by parties other than Calamos; (n) expenses and fees of registering or qualifying shares\nof beneficial interest of the Fund for sale; (o) interest charges, bond premiums and other insurance expenses; (p) freight, insurance and\nother charges in connection with the shipment of the Fund’s portfolio securities; (q) the compensation and all expenses (specifically\nincluding travel expenses relating to Fund business) of Trustees, officers and employees of the Fund who are not affiliated persons of\nCalamos; (r) brokerage commissions or other costs of acquiring or disposing of any portfolio securities of the Fund; (s) expenses of\nprinting\n35\nand distributing reports, notices and dividends to shareholders; (t) expenses of preparing and setting in type, printing and mailing\nprospectuses and statements of additional information of the Fund and supplements thereto; (u) costs of stationery; (v) any litigation\nexpenses; (w) indemnification of Trustees and officers of the Fund; (x) costs of shareholders’ and other meetings; (y) interest on\nborrowed money, if any; and (z) the fees and other expenses of listing the Fund’s shares on the NASDAQ or any other national stock\nexchange.\nThe basis for the Board’s initial approval of the Fund’s investment management agreement will be provided in the Fund’s initial\nshareholder report. The basis for subsequent continuations of the Fund’s investment management agreement will be provided in annual\nor semiannual reports to shareholders for the periods during which such continuations occur.\nCalamos is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calamos Investments LLC (“CILLC”).

The Global CIO and Co-CIO team are responsible for oversight of\ninvestment team resources, investment processes, performance and risk. As heads of investment verticals, Co-CIOs manage investment\nteam members and, along with Co-Portfolio Managers, have day-to-day portfolio oversight and construction responsibilities of their\nrespective investment strategies. While investment research professionals within each Co-CIO’s team are assigned specific strategy\nresponsibilities, they also provide support to other investment team verticals, creating deeper insights across a wider range of\ninvestment strategies. The combination of specialized investment teams with cross team collaboration results in what we call our team\nof teams approach.\nThis team of teams approach is further reflected in the composition of Calamos’ Investment Committee, made up of the Global\nCIO, the Co-CIO team, the Head of Global Trading, and the Chief of IT and Operations. Other members of the investment team\nparticipate in Investment Committee meetings in connection with specific investment related issues or topics as deemed appropriate.\nThe structure and composition of the Investment Committee results in a number of benefits, as it:\n• Leads to broader perspective on investment decisions: multiple viewpoints and areas of expertise feed into consensus;\n• Promotes collaboration between teams; and\n• Functions as a think tank with the goal of identifying ways to outperform the market on a risk-adjusted basis.\nThe objectives of the Investment Committee are to:\n• Form the firm’s top-down macro view, market direction, asset allocation, and sector/country positioning.\n• Establish firm-wide secular and cyclical themes for review.\n• Review firm-wide and portfolio risk metrics, recommending changes where appropriate.\n• Review firm-wide, portfolio and individual security liquidity constraints.\n• Evaluate firm-wide and portfolio investment performance.\n• Evaluate firm-wide and portfolio hedging policies and execution.\n• Evaluate enhancements to the overall investment process.\nJohn P.

In addition, Calamos has managed closed-end funds since 2002, and as of August 31, 2019, managed six closed-end funds\ntotaling approximately $6.8 billion in assets.\nThe Global CIO, Sr. Co-Portfolio Managers and Co-Portfolio Managers also have responsibility for the day-to-day management\nof accounts other than the Fund. Information regarding these other accounts as of August 31, 2019 is set forth below:\nRegistered Other Pooled\nInvestment Investment Other\nCompanies Vehicles Accounts\nAccounts Assets Accounts Assets Accounts Assets\nJohn P.

Calamos has\ndeveloped policies and procedures reasonably designed to mitigate those conflicts. For example, Calamos will place cross trades in\nsecurities held by the Fund only in accordance with the rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and has adopted policies designed to\nensure the fair allocation of securities purchased on an aggregated basis. The allocation methodology employed by Calamos varies\ndepending on the type of securities sought to be bought or sold and the type of client or group of clients. Generally, however, orders are\nplaced first for those clients that have given Calamos brokerage discretion (including the ability to step out a portion of trades), and then\nto clients that have directed Calamos to execute trades through a specific broker. However, if the directed broker allows Calamos to\nexecute with other brokerage firms, which then book the transaction directly with the directed broker, the order will be placed as if the\nclient had given Calamos full brokerage discretion. Calamos and its affiliates frequently use a “rotational” method of placing and\naggregating client orders and will build and fill a position for a designated client or group of clients before placing orders for other\nclients.\n38\nA client account may not receive an allocation of an order if: (a) the client would receive an unmarketable amount of securities\nbased on account size; (b) the client has precluded Calamos from using a particular broker; (c) the cash balance in the client account\nwill be insufficient to pay for the securities allocated to it at settlement; (d) current portfolio attributes make an allocation inappropriate;\nand (e) account specific guidelines, objectives and other account specific factors make an allocation inappropriate. Allocation\nmethodology may be modified when strict adherence to the usual allocation is impractical or leads to inefficient or undesirable results.\nCalamos’ head trader must approve each instance that the usual allocation methodology is not followed and provide a reasonable basis\nfor such instances and all modifications must be reported in writing to Calamos’ Chief Compliance Officer on a monthly basis.\nInvestment opportunities for which there is limited availability generally are allocated among participating client accounts\npursuant to an objective methodology (i.e., either on a pro rata basis or using a rotational method, as described above). However, in\nsome instances, Calamos may consider subjective elements in attempting to allocate a trade, in which case the Fund may not participate,\nor may participate to a lesser degree than other clients, in the allocation of an investment opportunity. In considering subjective criteria\nwhen allocating trades, Calamos is bound by its fiduciary duty to its clients to treat all client accounts fairly and equitably.\nThe Co-Portfolio Managers advise certain accounts under a performance fee arrangement. A performance fee arrangement may\ncreate an incentive for a Portfolio Manager to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the\nabsence of performance fees. A performance fee arrangement may result in increased compensation to the Portfolio Managers from\nsuch accounts due to unrealized appreciation as well as realized gains in the client’s account.\nAs of August 31, 2019, John P. Calamos, Sr., our Global CIO, aside from distributions arising from his ownership from various\nentities, receives all of his compensation from Calamos. He has entered into an employment agreement that provides for compensation\nin the form of an annual base salary and a target bonus, both components payable in cash. His target bonus is set at a percentage of the\nrespective base salary. Similarly, Mr. Calamos, Sr. is eligible for a Long-Term Incentive (“LTI”). The LTI program at Calamos\ncurrently consists of two types of awards: (1) Mutual Fund Incentive Awards for investment professionals and (2) Phantom Equity\nIncentive Awards for non-investment professionals.\nAs of August 31, 2019, Chuck Carmody, R. Matthew Freund, Michael Grant, Jon Vacko, and Joe Wysocki receive all of their\ncompensation from Calamos. These individuals each receive compensation in the form of an annual base salary, a discretionary bonus\n(payable in cash) and are eligible for LTI awards. Each of these individuals is also eligible for discretionary LTI awards based on\nindividual and collective performance, however these awards are not guaranteed from year to year. The LTI program at Calamos for\ninvestment professionals is a Mutual Fund Incentive Award with amounts deemed to be invested in one or more funds. “Funds” mean\nmutual funds, ETFs or private funds managed by Calamos or a subsidiary of Calamos.\nIn addition to the forms of compensation described above, Mr. Grant is also eligible to receive certain amounts proportionate to\nadvisory fees received from certain other accounts (including certain accounts that pay performance based compensation) for which he\nprovides portfolio manager services, as well as amounts to be determined based on asset levels within the Calamos Phineus Long/Short\nFund (a separate open-end fund managed by the Adviser), subject to various conditions. The existence of these payments could create a\nconflict of interest with regard to Mr. Grant’s allocation of investment opportunities among the accounts for which he acts as portfolio\nmanager. Calamos has in place policies and procedures reasonably designed to mitigate such conflicts of interest.\nThe amounts paid to all Co-Portfolio Managers and the criteria utilized to determine the amounts are benchmarked against\nindustry specific data provided by third party analytical agencies. The Co-Portfolio Managers’ compensation structure does not\ndifferentiate between the Fund and other accounts managed by the Co-Portfolio Managers, and is determined on an overall basis, taking\ninto consideration annually the performance of the various strategies managed by the Co-Portfolio Managers. Portfolio performance is\nutilized as one factor in determining the annual discretionary bonus, as well as overall performance of Calamos.\n39\nAt August 31, 2019 each portfolio manager beneficially owned (as determined pursuant to Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)) shares of the Fund having value within the indicated dollar ranges.\nPortfolio Manager Registrant*\nJohn P. Calamos, Sr. None\nMichael Grant None\nR. Matthew Freund None\nJon Vacko None\nJoe Wysocki None\nChuck Carmody None\n* As of August 31, 2019 the Fund had not commenced operations.\nFund Accountant and Administration Arrangements\nThe Fund has entered into an agreement with Ernst & Young LLP (“EY”) located at 155 N. Wacker Drive,\nChicago, IL 60606 to provide certain tax services to the Funds. The tax services include the following: calculating, tracking and\nreporting tax adjustments on all assets of the Fund, including but not limited to contingent debt and preferred trust obligations;\npreparing excise tax and fiscal year distribution schedules; preparing tax information required for financial statement footnotes;\npreparing state and federal income tax returns; preparing specialized calculations of amortization on convertible securities; preparing\nyear-end dividend disclosure information; providing treaty-based foreign withholding tax reclaim services; providing certain global\ncompliance and reporting services; providing a match service and analysis of the “passive foreign investment company” status of\nforeign corporate entities; and providing services related to corporate actions that may or may not have a tax impact on the Fund’s\nholdings.\nUnder the arrangements with State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) located at One Iron Street, Boston, MA 02111\nto provide fund accounting services, State Street provides certain administrative and accounting services including providing daily\nreconciliation of cash, trades and positions; maintaining general ledger and capital stock accounts; preparing daily trial balance;\ncalculating net asset value; providing selected general ledger reports; preferred share compliance; calculating total returns; and\nproviding monthly distribution analysis to the Fund. The Fund has also entered into an agreement with State Street pursuant to which\nState Street provides certain administration treasury services to the Fund. These services include: monitoring the calculation of expense\naccrual amounts for the Fund and making any necessary modifications; managing the Fund’s expenses and expense payment\nprocessing; coordinating any expense reimbursement calculations and payment; calculating net investment income dividends and\ncapital gain distributions; coordinating the audits for the Fund; preparing financial reporting statements for the Fund; preparing certain\nregulatory filings; and calculating asset coverage tests for certain Calamos Funds.\nCERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS\nPrior to this offering, the Adviser purchased 7,194.24 common shares from the Fund in an amount satisfying the net worth\nrequirements of Section 14(a) of the 1940 Act. Therefore, the Adviser currently owns 100% of the outstanding common shares. The\nAdviser may be deemed to control the Fund until such time as it owns less than 25% of the outstanding common shares, which is\nexpected to occur as of the completion of this offering. The principal business address of the Adviser is 2020 Calamos Court,\nNaperville, Illinois 60563.\nAt August 31, 2019, the Fund had not commenced operations, therefore each trustee, and the trustees and officers as a group, did\nnot own any of the Fund’s common shares.\nPORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS\nPortfolio transactions on behalf of the Fund effected on stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage\ncommissions. There is generally no stated commission in the case of securities traded in the over-the-counter markets, but the price paid\nby the Fund usually includes an undisclosed dealer commission or mark-up. In\n40\nunderwritten offerings, the price paid by the Fund includes a disclosed, fixed commission or discount retained by the underwriter or\ndealer.\nIn executing portfolio transactions, Calamos seeks to obtain for the Fund the most favorable combination of price and execution\navailable. In seeking the most favorable combination of price and execution, Calamos considers all factors it deems relevant, including\nprice, the size of the transaction, the nature of the market for the security, the amount of commission, the timing of the transaction\ntaking into account market prices and trends, the execution capability of the broker-dealer and the quality of service rendered by the\nbroker-dealer in other transactions.\nThe Trustees have determined that portfolio transactions for the Fund may be executed through CFS, an affiliate of Calamos, if, in\nthe judgment of Calamos, the use of CFS is likely to result in prices and execution at least as favorable to the Fund as those available\nfrom other qualified brokers and if, in such transactions, CFS charges the Fund commission rates consistent with those charged by CFS\nto comparable unaffiliated customers in similar transactions. The Board of Trustees, including a majority of the Trustees who are not\nInterested Trustees, has adopted procedures that are reasonably designed to provide that any commissions, fees or other remuneration\npaid to CFS are consistent with the foregoing standard. The Fund will not effect principal transactions with CFS.\nIn allocating the Fund’s portfolio brokerage transactions to unaffiliated broker-dealers, Calamos may take into consideration the\nresearch, analytical, statistical and other information and services provided by the broker-dealer, such as general economic reports and\ninformation, reports or analyses of particular companies or industry groups, market timing and technical information, and the\navailability of the brokerage firm’s analysts for consultation. Although Calamos believes these services have substantial value, they are\nconsidered supplemental to Calamos’ own efforts in the performance of its duties under the management agreement.\nCalamos does not guarantee any broker the placement of a predetermined amount of securities transactions in return for the\nresearch or brokerage services it provides. Calamos has adopted internal procedures which it believes are reasonably designed to\nallocate transactions in a manner consistent with its execution policies to brokers that it has identified as providing research, research-\nrelated products or services, or execution-related services of a particular benefit to its clients. Calamos has entered into client\ncommission agreements (“CCAs”) with certain broker-dealers under which the broker-dealers may use a portion of their commissions\nto pay third parties or other broker-dealers that provide Calamos with research or brokerage services, as permitted under Section 28(e)\nof the Exchange Act. CCAs allow Calamos to direct broker-dealers to pool commissions that are generated from orders executed at that\nbroker-dealer, and then periodically direct the broker-dealer to pay third parties or other broker-dealers for research or brokerage\nservices. All uses of CCAs by Calamos are subject to applicable law and its best execution obligations. Brokerage and research products\nand services furnished by brokers may be used in servicing any or all of the clients of Calamos and such research may not necessarily\nbe used by Calamos in connection with the accounts which paid commissions to the broker providing such brokerage and research\nproducts and services.\nAs permitted by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act, Calamos may cause the Fund to pay a broker-dealer that provides brokerage\nand research services an amount of commission for effecting a securities transaction for the Fund in excess of the commission that\nanother broker-dealer would have charged for effecting that transaction if the amount is believed by Calamos to be reasonable in\nrelation to the value of the overall quality of the brokerage and research services provided. Other clients of Calamos may indirectly\nbenefit from the provision of these services to Calamos, and the Fund may indirectly benefit from services provided to Calamos as a\nresult of transactions for other clients.\nPortfolio Turnover\nOur annual portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year. Although we cannot accurately predict our annual portfolio\nturnover rate, it is generally expected to exceed 100% annually under normal circumstances. However, portfolio turnover is not\nconsidered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions for the Fund, and it is possible that the Fund may exceed this level\nof turnover in any given year. A higher turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional\nexpenses that are borne by the Fund. High portfolio turnover also may result in the realization of capital gains or losses and, to the\nextent net short-term capital gains are realized, any distributions resulting from such gains will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Federal Income Tax Matters.”\n41\nNET ASSET VALUE\nNet asset value per share is determined as of the close of regular session trading on the New York Stock Exchange (usually\n4:00 p.m., Eastern time) on the last business day in each week. Net asset value is calculated by dividing the value of all of the securities\nand other assets of the Fund, less its liabilities (including accrued expenses and indebtedness) and the aggregate liquidation value of any\noutstanding preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding. Currently, the net asset values of shares of publicly\ntraded closed-end investment companies investing in debt securities are published in Barron’s and periodic publications of The Wall\nStreet Journal.\nThe valuation of the Fund’s portfolio securities is in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by and under the ultimate\nsupervision of the Board of Trustees. Securities for which market quotations are readily available will be valued using the market value\nof those securities. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available will be fair valued in accordance with policies and\nprocedures adopted by and under the ultimate supervision of the Board of Trustees. The method by which a security may be fair valued\nwill depend on the type of security and the circumstances under which the security is being fair valued.\nPortfolio securities that are traded on U.S. securities exchanges, except option securities, are valued at the last current reported\nsales price at the time the Fund determines its NAV. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market and quoted on the NASDAQ\nStock Market are valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price, as determined by NASDAQ, or lacking a NASDAQ Official Closing\nPrice, the last current reported sale price on NASDAQ at the time the Fund determines its NAV.\nWhen a last sale or closing price is not available, equity securities, other than option securities, that are traded on a U.S. securities\nexchange and other equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at the mean between the most recent bid and\nasked quotations in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Board of Trustees. Each option security traded on a U.S. securities\nexchange is valued at the mid-point of the consolidated bid/ask quote for the option security, also in accordance with guidelines adopted\nby the Board of Trustees. Each over-the-counter option that is not traded through the Options Clearing Corporation is valued based on a\nquotation provided by the counterparty to such option under the ultimate supervision of the Board of Trustees.\nFixed income securities are generally traded in the over-the-counter market and are valued based on evaluations provided by\nindependent pricing services or by dealers who make markets in such securities. Valuations of fixed income securities consider yield or\nprice of bonds of comparable quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market data and do not rely\nexclusively upon exchange or over-the-counter prices.\nTrading on European and Far Eastern exchanges and over-the-counter markets is typically completed at various times before the\nclose of business on each day on which the NYSE is open. Each security trading on these exchanges or over-the-counter markets may\nbe valued utilizing a systematic fair valuation model provided by an independent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees.\nThe valuation of each security that meets certain criteria in relation to the valuation model is systematically adjusted to reflect the\nimpact of movement in the U.S. market after the foreign markets close. Securities that do not meet the criteria, or that are principally\ntraded in other foreign markets, are valued as of the last reported sale price at the time the Fund determines its NAV, or when reliable\nmarket prices or quotations are not readily available, at the mean between the most recent bid and asked quotations as of the close of the\nappropriate exchange or other designated time. Trading of foreign securities may not take place on every NYSE business day. In\naddition, trading may take place in various foreign markets on Saturdays or on other days when the NYSE is not open and on which the\nFund’s NAV is not calculated.\nIf the pricing committee determines that the valuation of a security in accordance with the methods described above is not\nreflective of a market value for such security, the security is valued at a fair value by the pricing committee, under the ultimate\nsupervision of the Board of Trustees, following the guidelines and/or procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.\nThe Fund also may use fair value pricing, pursuant to guidelines adopted by the Board of Trustees and under the ultimate\nsupervision of the Board of Trustees, if trading in the security is halted or if the value of a security it\n42\nholds is materially affected by events occurring before the Fund’s pricing time but after the close of the primary market or exchange on\nwhich the security is listed. Those procedures may utilize valuations furnished by pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees,\nwhich may be based on market transactions for comparable securities and various relationships between securities that are generally\nrecognized by institutional traders, a computerized matrix system, or appraisals derived from information concerning the securities or\nsimilar securities received from recognized dealers in those securities.\nWhen fair value pricing of securities is employed, the prices of securities used by the Fund to calculate its NAV may differ from\nmarket quotations or official closing prices. In light of the judgment involved in fair valuations, there can be no assurance that a fair\nvalue assigned to a particular security is accurate.\nREPURCHASE OF COMMON SHARES\nThe Fund is a closed-end investment company and as such its shareholders will not have the right to cause the Fund to redeem\ntheir shares. Instead, following our initial public offering, the Fund’s common shares will trade in the open market at a price that is a\nfunction of several factors, including dividend levels (which are in turn affected by expenses), net asset value, call protection, dividend\nstability, relative demand for and supply of such shares in the market, general market and economic conditions and other factors.\nBecause shares of a closed-end investment company may frequently trade at prices lower than net asset value, the Fund’s Board of\nTrustees may consider action that might be taken to reduce or eliminate any material discount from net asset value in respect of\ncommon shares, which may include the repurchase of such shares in the open market or in private transactions, the making of a tender\noffer for such shares. The Board of Trustees may decide not to take any of these actions. In addition, there can be no assurance that\nshare repurchases or tender offers, if undertaken, will reduce market discount.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, at any time when the Fund’s preferred shares are outstanding, the Fund may not purchase, redeem\nor otherwise acquire any of its common shares unless (1) all accumulated preferred shares dividends have been paid and (2) at the time\nof such purchase, redemption or acquisition, the net asset value of the Fund’s portfolio (determined after deducting the acquisition price\nof the common shares) is at least 200% of the liquidation value of the outstanding preferred shares (expected to equal the original\npurchase price per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon). Any service fees incurred in connection with any tender offer\nmade by the Fund will be borne by the Fund and will not reduce the stated consideration to be paid to tendering shareholders.\nSubject to its investment restrictions, the Fund may borrow to finance the repurchase of shares or to make a tender offer. Interest\non any borrowings to finance share repurchase transactions or the accumulation of cash by the Fund in anticipation of share repurchases\nor tenders will reduce the Fund’s net income. Any share repurchase, tender offer or borrowing that might be approved by the Fund’s\nBoard of Trustees would have to comply with the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAlthough the decision to take action in response to a discount from net asset value will be made by the Board of Trustees at the\ntime it considers such issue, it is not currently anticipated that the Board of Trustees would authorize repurchases of common shares or\na tender offer for such shares if: (1) such transactions, if consummated, would (a) result in the delisting of the common shares from the\nNASDAQ, or (b) impair the Fund’s status as a regulated investment company under the Code (which would make the Fund a taxable\nentity, causing the Fund’s income to be taxed at the corporate level in addition to the taxation of shareholders who receive dividends\nfrom the Fund) or as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act; (2) the Fund would not be able to liquidate\nportfolio securities in an orderly manner and consistent with the Fund’s investment objective and policies in order to repurchase shares;\nor (3) there is, in the board’s judgment, any (a) material legal action or proceeding instituted or threatened challenging such transactions\nor otherwise materially adversely affecting the Fund, (b) general suspension of or limitation on prices for trading securities on the\nNASDAQ, (c) declaration of a banking moratorium by federal or state authorities or any suspension of payment by United States or\nNew York banks, (d) material limitation affecting the Fund or the issuers of its portfolio securities by federal or state authorities on the\nextension of credit by lending institutions or on the exchange of foreign currency, (e) commencement of war, armed hostilities or other\ninternational or national calamity directly or indirectly involving the United States, or (f) other event or condition which would have a\nmaterial adverse effect (including any adverse tax effect) on the Fund or its shareholders if shares were repurchased.\n43\nThe repurchase by the Fund of its shares at prices below net asset value will result in an increase in the net asset value of those\nshares that remain outstanding. However, there can be no assurance that share repurchases or tender offers at or below net asset value\nwill result in the Fund’s shares trading at a price equal to their net asset value. Nevertheless, the fact that the Fund’s shares may be the\nsubject of repurchase or tender offers from time to time may reduce any spread between market price and net asset value that might\notherwise exist.\nIn addition, a purchase by the Fund of its common shares will decrease the Fund’s total managed assets which would likely have\nthe effect of increasing the Fund’s expense ratio. Any purchase by the Fund of its common shares at a time when preferred shares are\noutstanding will increase the leverage applicable to the outstanding common shares then remaining.\nBefore deciding whether to take any action if the common shares trade below net asset value, the Fund’s Board of Trustees would\nlikely consider all relevant factors, including the extent and duration of the discount, the liquidity of the Fund’s portfolio, the impact of\nany action that might be taken on the Fund or its shareholders and market considerations. Based on these considerations, even if the\nFund’s shares should trade at a discount, the Board of Trustees may determine that, in the interest of the Fund and its shareholders, no\naction should be taken.\nCERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS\nThe following is a summary discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a shareholder or a\nnoteholder (as the case may be) that acquires, holds and/or disposes of the Fund’s securities. This discussion only addresses certain U.S.\nfederal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders and noteholders (as the case may be) who hold their Fund securities as capital\nassets and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to particular shareholders and\nnoteholders (as the case may be) in light of their individual circumstances. This discussion also does not address all U.S. federal, state,\nlocal and foreign tax concerns affecting the Fund and its shareholders and noteholders (including shareholders and noteholders subject\nto special tax rules and shareholders owning large positions in the Fund), and the discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax\nadvice. The discussion reflects applicable tax laws of the United States as of the date of this Statement of Additional Information, which\ntax laws may be changed or subject to new interpretations by the courts or the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) retroactively or\nprospectively. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from any\nof the tax aspects set forth below. The specific terms of preferred shares and debt securities may result in different tax consequences to\nholders than those described herein. No attempt is made to present a detailed explanation of all U.S. federal income tax concerns\naffecting the Fund and its shareholders and noteholders, and the discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice. Investors are\nurged to consult their own tax advisers to determine the specific tax consequences to them of investing in the Fund, including\nthe applicable federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences to them and the effect of possible changes in tax laws.\nFederal Income Taxation of the Fund\nThe Fund intends to elect to be treated, and intends to qualify each year, as a “regulated investment company” under Subchapter\nM of the Code, so that it will not pay U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and capital gains timely\ndistributed to shareholders. If the Fund qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of\nthe sum of (i) its “investment company taxable income” as that term is defined in the Code (which includes, among other things,\ndividends, taxable interest, the excess of any net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses, taking into account any\ncapital loss carryforwards, and certain net foreign currency exchange gains, less certain deductible expenses) without regard to the\ndeduction for dividends paid and (ii) the excess of its gross tax-exempt interest, if any, over certain disallowed deductions, the Fund will\nbe relieved of U.S. federal income tax on any income of the Fund, including long-term capital gains, distributed to shareholders.\nHowever, if the Fund retains any investment company taxable income or “net capital gain” (i.e., the excess of net long-term capital gain\nover the sum of net short-term capital loss and any capital loss carryforwards), it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular\ncorporate rates on the amount retained. The Fund intends to distribute at least annually, all or substantially all of its investment\ncompany taxable income, net tax-exempt interest, if any, and net capital gain.\n44\nIn determining its net capital gain, its taxable income, and its earnings and profits, a regulated investment company generally may\nelect to treat part or all of any post-October capital loss (defined as any net capital loss attributable to the portion, if any, of the taxable\nyear after October 31 or, if there is no such loss, the net long-term capital loss or net short-term capital loss attributable to any such\nportion of the taxable year) or late-year ordinary loss (generally, the sum of (i) net ordinary loss, if any, from the sale, exchange or other\ntaxable disposition of property, attributable to the portion, if any, of the taxable year after October 31, and its (ii) other net ordinary loss,\nif any, attributable to the portion of the taxable year, if any, after December 31) as if incurred in the succeeding taxable year.\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains (“net capital losses”) are not permitted to be deducted against the Fund’s net investment\nincome. Instead, potentially subject to certain limitations, the Fund may carry net capital losses from any taxable year forward to\nsubsequent taxable years without expiration to offset capital gains, if any, realized during such subsequent taxable years. Capital loss\ncarryforwards are reduced to the extent they offset current-year net realized capital gains, whether the Fund retains or distributes such\ngains. The Fund must apply such carryforwards first against gains of the same character.\nIf for any taxable year the Fund did not qualify as a regulated investment company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would\nbe treated in the same manner as a regular corporation subject to U.S. federal income tax and distributions to its shareholders would not\nbe deductible by the Fund in computing its taxable income. In such event, the Fund’s distributions, to the extent derived from the\nFund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, would generally constitute ordinary dividends, which would generally be eligible\nfor the dividends received deduction available to corporate shareholders under Section 243 of the Code, and noncorporate shareholders\nof the Fund would generally be able to treat such distributions as “qualified dividend income” eligible for reduced rates of federal\nincome taxation under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code, as described below.\nThe Fund could be required to recognize unrealized gains, pay substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions\nbefore requalifying as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax treatment.\nUnder the Code, the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% federal excise tax on its undistributed ordinary income for a\ncalendar year and its undistributed capital gains for the one-year period generally ending on October 31 of such calendar year if it fails\nto meet certain distribution requirements with respect to that year. For purposes of the required excise tax distribution, a regulated\ninvestment company’s ordinary gains and losses from the sale, exchange, or other taxable disposition of property that would otherwise\nbe taken into account after October 31 generally are treated as arising on January 1 of the following calendar year. Also, for purposes of\nthe excise tax, the Fund will be treated as having distributed any amount on which it is subject to corporate income tax for the taxable\nyear ending within the calendar year. The Fund intends to generally make distributions in a timely manner and in an amount sufficient\nto avoid such tax and accordingly does not expect to be subject to this excise tax.\nIn order to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code, the Fund must, among other things, derive\nat least 90% of its gross income for each taxable year from (i) dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans, gains from\nthe sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including gains from options, futures and\nforward contracts) derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and (ii) net income derived\nfrom interests in certain publicly traded partnerships that derive less than 90% of their gross income from the items described in\n(i) above (each, a “Qualified Publicly Traded Partnership”) (the “90% income test”). For purposes of the 90% income test, the character\nof income earned by certain entities in which the Fund invests that are not treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes\nwill generally pass through to the Fund. Consequently, the Fund may be required to limit its equity investments in certain such entities.\nIn addition to the 90% income test, the Fund must also diversify its holdings (the “asset test”) so that, at the end of each quarter of\nits taxable year (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Fund’s total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government\nsecurities, securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with such other securities of any one issuer limited\nfor the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater in value than 5% of the value of the Fund’s total assets and to not more than\n10% of the outstanding voting\n45\nsecurities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested, including through corporations in which\nthe Fund owns a 20% or more voting stock interest, in the securities (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other\nregulated investment companies) of any one issuer or of two or more issuers controlled by the Fund and engaged in the same, similar or\nrelated trades or businesses or in the securities of one or more Qualified Publicly Traded Partnerships.\nForeign exchange gains and losses realized by the Fund in connection with certain transactions involving foreign currency-\ndenominated debt securities, certain options and futures contracts relating to foreign currency, foreign currency forward contracts,\nforeign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Section 988 of the Code, which generally\ncauses such gains and losses to be treated as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of\ndistributions to shareholders.\nIf the Fund acquires any equity interest (generally including not only stock but also an option to acquire stock such as is inherent\nin a convertible bond) in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such\nas interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties, or capital gains) or that hold at least 50% of their assets in investments held for the\nproduction of such passive income (“passive foreign investment companies”), the Fund could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and\nadditional interest charges on “excess distributions” received from such companies or on gain from the sale of equity interests in such\ncompanies, even if all income or gain actually received by the Fund is timely distributed to its shareholders. These investments could\nalso result in the treatment as ordinary income of associated gains on a sale of the investment. The Fund would not be able to pass\nthrough to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such tax. Tax elections may generally be available that would ameliorate these\nadverse tax consequences, but any such election could require the Fund to recognize taxable income or gain (which would be subject to\nthe distribution requirements described above) without the concurrent receipt of cash. The Fund may limit and/or manage its holdings in\npassive foreign investment companies to limit its U.S. federal income tax liability or maximize its return from these investments.\nIf the Fund invests in certain pay-in-kind securities, zero coupon securities, deferred interest securities or, in general, any other\nsecurities with original issue discount (“OID”) (or with market discount if the Fund elects to include market discount in income\ncurrently), the Fund must accrue income on such investments for each taxable year, which generally will be prior to the receipt of the\ncorresponding cash payments. However, the Fund must distribute, at least annually, all or substantially all of its investment company\ntaxable income, including such accrued income, to shareholders to avoid U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Therefore, the Fund may\nhave to dispose of its portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash, or may have to leverage itself by\nborrowing the cash, to satisfy distribution requirements.\nThe Fund may acquire market discount bonds. A market discount bond is a security acquired in the secondary market at a price\nbelow its stated redemption price at maturity (or its adjusted issue price if it is also an OID bond). If the Fund invests in a market\ndiscount bond, it will be required to treat any gain recognized on the disposition of such market discount bond as ordinary income\n(instead of capital gain) to the extent of the accrued market discount, unless the Fund elects to include the market discount in income as\nit accrues as discussed above. Such market discount will not constitute qualified dividend income.\nThe Fund may invest to a significant extent in debt obligations that are in the lowest rating categories or are unrated, including\ndebt obligations of issuers not currently paying interest or who are in default. Investments in debt obligations that are at risk of or in\ndefault present special tax issues for the Fund. The U.S. federal income tax laws are not entirely clear about issues such as when the\nFund may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or\nworthless securities and how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and income. These and\nother related issues will be addressed by the Fund when, as and if it invests in such securities, in order to ensure that it distributes\nsufficient\n46\nincome to preserve its status as a regulated investment company and does not become subject to U.S. federal income or excise taxes.\nVery generally, where the Fund purchases a bond at a price that exceeds the stated redemption price at maturity – that is, at a\npremium – the premium is amortizable over the remaining term of the bond. In the case of a taxable bond, if the Fund makes an election\napplicable to all such bonds it purchases, which election is irrevocable without consent of the IRS, the Fund reduces the current taxable\nincome from the bond by the amortized premium and reduces its tax basis in the bond by the amount of such offset; upon the\ndisposition or maturity of such bonds, the Fund is permitted to deduct any remaining premium allocable to a prior period. In the case of\na tax-exempt bond, tax rules require the Fund to reduce its tax basis by the amount of amortized premium.\nCertain of the Fund’s other investments may cause the Fund to recognize income without the corresponding receipt of cash, which\ncould result in the Fund being required to dispose of its portfolio securities under disadvantageous circumstances to generate cash or\nleverage itself by borrowing cash to satisfy distribution requirements and to avoid entity-level tax.\nThe Fund may engage in various transactions in options, futures contracts, forward contracts, hedging instruments, straddles,\nswaps and other similar transactions. In addition to the special rules described below, such transactions may be subject to special\nprovisions of the Code that, among other things, affect the character of any income realized by the Fund from such investments,\naccelerate recognition of income to the Fund, defer Fund losses, affect the holding period of the Fund’s securities, affect whether\ndistributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction or be treated as qualified dividend income and affect the\ndetermination of whether capital gain and loss is characterized as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss. These rules could\ntherefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These provisions may also require the Fund\nto “mark-to-market” certain types of the positions in its portfolio (i.e., treat them as if they were closed out), which may cause the Fund\nto recognize income without receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution\nrequirements for avoiding U.S. federal income and excise taxes. Because these and other tax rules applicable to these types of\ntransactions are in some cases uncertain under current law, an adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS with respect to these\nrules (which determination or guidance could be retroactive) may affect whether the Fund has made sufficient distributions, and\notherwise satisfied the relevant requirements, to maintain its qualification as a regulated investment company and avoid a Fund-level\ntax. The Fund will monitor its transactions and will make the appropriate entries in its books and records when it acquires an option,\nfutures contract, forward contract, hedge instrument, swap or other similar investment, and if the Fund deems it advisable, will make\nappropriate elections in order to mitigate the effect of these rules, prevent disqualification of the Fund as a regulated investment\ncompany and minimize the imposition of U.S. federal income and excise taxes.\nCertain of the Fund’s investments in derivative instruments and foreign currency denominated instruments, and any of the Fund’s\ntransactions in foreign currencies and hedging activities, are likely to produce a difference between its book income and the sum of its\ntaxable income (including realized capital gains) and net tax-exempt income (if any). If such a difference arises and the Fund’s book\nincome is less than the sum of its taxable income (including realized capital gains) and net tax-exempt income (if any), the Fund could\nbe required to make distributions exceeding book income to qualify as a regulated investment company that is accorded special tax\ntreatment and to avoid a Fund-level tax. If the Fund’s book income exceeds the sum of its taxable income (including realized capital\ngains) and net tax-exempt income (if any), the distribution (if any) of such excess generally will be treated as (i) a dividend to the extent\nof the Fund’s remaining current and accumulated earnings and profits (including earnings and profits arising from tax-exempt income),\nif any, (ii) thereafter, as a return of capital to the extent of the recipient’s adjusted tax basis in its shares, and (iii) thereafter, as gain from\nthe sale or exchange of a capital asset.\nIn general, option premiums received by the Fund are not immediately included in the income of the Fund. Instead, the premiums\nare recognized when the option contract expires, the option is exercised by the holder, or the Fund transfers or otherwise terminates the\noption (e.g., through a closing transaction). If a call option written by the Fund is exercised and the Fund sells or delivers the underlying\nstock, the Fund generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to (a) the sum of the strike price and the option premium received by\nthe Fund minus (b) the Fund’s basis in the stock. Such gain or loss generally will be short-term or long-term depending upon the\nholding period of\n47\nthe underlying stock. If securities are purchased by the Fund pursuant to the exercise of a put option written by it, the Fund generally\nwill subtract the premium received for purposes of computing its cost basis in the securities purchased. The termination of the Fund’s\nobligation under an option other than through the exercise of the option will result in gain or loss, depending on whether the premium\nincome received by the Fund is greater or less than the amount paid by the Fund (if any) in terminating the transaction. Subject to\ncertain exceptions, some of which are described below, such gain or loss generally will be short-term. Thus, for example, if an option\nwritten by the Fund expires unexercised, the Fund generally will recognize short-term gain equal to the premium received.\nThe Fund’s options activities may include transactions constituting straddles for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that is, that\ntrigger the U.S. federal income tax straddle rules contained primarily in Section 1092 of the Code. Such straddles include, for example,\npositions in a particular security, or an index of securities, and one or more options that offset the former position, including options that\nare “covered” by a Fund’s long position in the subject security. Very generally, where applicable, Section 1092 requires (i) that losses\nbe deferred on positions deemed to be offsetting positions with respect to “substantially similar or related property,” to the extent of\nunrealized gain in the latter, and (ii) that the holding period of such a straddle position that has not already been held for the long-term\nholding period be terminated and begin anew once the position is no longer part of a straddle. Options on single stocks that are not\n“deep in the money” may constitute qualified covered calls, which generally are not subject to the straddle rules; the holding period on\nstock underlying qualified covered calls that are “in the money” although not “deep in the money” will be suspended during the period\nthat such calls are outstanding. These straddle rules and the rules governing qualified covered calls could cause gains that would\notherwise constitute long-term capital gains to be treated as short-term capital gains, and distributions that would otherwise constitute\n“qualified dividend income” or qualify for the dividends received deduction to fail to satisfy the holding period requirements and\ntherefore to be taxed as ordinary income or to fail to qualify for the dividends received deduction, as the case may be.\nThe Fund’s transactions in certain investments (including broad based equity index options and certain other futures contracts) are\ngenerally considered “Section 1256 contracts” for federal income tax purposes. Any unrealized gains or losses on such Section 1256\ncontracts are treated as though they were realized at the end of each taxable year. The resulting gain or loss is treated as sixty percent\nlong-term capital gain or loss and forty percent short-term capital gain or loss. Gain or loss recognized on actual sales of Section 1256\ncontracts is treated in the same manner. As noted below, distributions of net short-term capital gain are taxable to shareholders as\nordinary income while distributions of net long-term capital gain that are properly reported as capital gain dividends are taxable to\nshareholders as long-term capital gain, regardless of how long the shareholder has held shares of the Fund.\nThe Fund’s entry into a short sale transaction, an option or certain other contracts could be treated as the constructive sale of an\nappreciated financial position, causing the Fund to realize gain, but not loss, on the position.\nAny investment by the Fund in equity securities of REITs may result in the Fund’s receipt of cash in excess of the REIT’s\nearnings; if the Fund distributes these amounts, these distributions could constitute a return of capital to Fund shareholders for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes. Dividends received by the Fund from a REIT will not qualify for the corporate dividends received\ndeduction and generally will not constitute qualified dividend income. The Fund may invest in REITs that hold residual interests in real\nestate mortgage investment conduits (“REMICs”). Under a notice issued by the IRS, a portion of the Fund’s income from a REIT that is\nattributable to the REIT’s residual interest in a REMIC (referred to in the Code as an “excess inclusion”) will be subject to U.S. federal\nincome tax in all events. This notice also provides that excess inclusion income of a regulated investment company, such as the Fund,\nwill be allocated to shareholders of the regulated investment company in proportion to the dividends received by such shareholders,\nwith the same consequences as if the shareholders held the related REMIC residual interest directly. In general, excess inclusion income\nallocated to shareholders (i) cannot be offset by net operating losses (subject to a limited exception for certain thrift institutions),\n(ii) will constitute unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) to entities (including a qualified pension plan, an individual retirement\naccount, a 401(k) plan, a Keogh plan or other tax-exempt entity) subject to federal income tax on unrelated business income, thereby\npotentially requiring such an entity that is allocated excess inclusion income, and otherwise might not be required to file a federal\nincome tax return, to file a tax return and pay tax on such income, and (iii) in the case of a foreign shareholder, will not qualify for any\nreduction in U.S. federal withholding tax. In addition, special tax consequences apply to charitable remainder trusts (“CRTs”) that\ninvest in regulated investment companies that invest directly or indirectly in residual interests in REMICs. Under legislation enacted in\nDecember 2006, a CRT, as defined in\n48\nSection 664 of the Code, that realizes any UBTI for a taxable year, must pay an excise tax annually of an amount equal to such UBTI.\nUnder IRS guidance issued in 2006, a CRT will not recognize UBTI solely as a result of investing in a regulated investment company\nthat recognizes “excess inclusion income.” Rather, if at any time during any taxable year a CRT (or one of certain\nother tax-exempt shareholders, such as the United States, a state or political subdivision, or an agency or instrumentality thereof, and\ncertain energy cooperatives) is a record holder of a share in a regulated investment company that recognizes “excess inclusion income,”\nthen the regulated investment company will be subject to a tax on that portion of its “excess inclusion income” for the taxable year that\nis allocable to such shareholders at the highest federal corporate income tax rate. The extent to which this IRS guidance remains\napplicable in light of the December 2006 legislation is unclear. To the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, the Fund may elect to\nspecially allocate any such tax to the applicable CRT, or other shareholder, and thus reduce such shareholder’s distributions for the year\nby the amount of the tax that relates to such shareholder’s interest in the Fund. The Fund has not yet determined whether such an\nelection will be made. CRTs and other tax-exempt shareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers concerning the consequences of\ninvesting in the Fund. The Fund does not intend to invest in REITs in which a substantial portion of the assets will consist of residual\ninterests in REMICs.\nThe Fund may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by foreign countries, including taxes on interest, dividends and\ncapital gains with respect to its investments in those countries, which would, if imposed, reduce the yield on or return from those\ninvestments. If more than 50% of the value of the Fund’s assets at the close of the taxable year consists of stock or securities of foreign\ncorporations, the Fund may make an election under the Code to pass through such taxes to shareholders of the Fund. If the Fund is\neligible to and makes such an election, shareholders will generally be able (subject to applicable limitations under the Code) to claim a\ncredit or deduction (but not both) on their federal income tax return for, and will be required to treat as part of the amounts distributed to\nthem, their pro rata portion of the income taxes paid by the Fund to foreign countries. If the Fund makes such an election, it will provide\nrelevant information to its shareholders. If such an election is not made, shareholders will not be required to include such taxes in their\ngross incomes and will not be entitled to a tax deduction or credit for such taxes on their own federal income tax returns. Each\nprospective investor is urged to consult its tax adviser regarding taxation of foreign securities in the Fund’s portfolio and any available\nforeign tax credits with respect to the prospective investor’s own situation.\nCommon Shares and Preferred Shares\nCommon Share Distributions. Unless a shareholder is ineligible to participate or elects otherwise, all distributions on common\nshares will be automatically reinvested in additional common shares of the Fund pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the\n“Dividend Reinvestment Plan”). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, dividends are generally taxable whether a shareholder takes\nthem in cash or they are reinvested pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan in additional shares of the Fund.\nDistributions of investment company taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid), which\nincludes dividends, taxable interest, net short-term capital gain in excess of net long-term capital loss, taking into account any capital\nloss carryforwards and certain net foreign currency exchange gains, are, except as discussed below, taxable as ordinary income to the\nextent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. A portion of such dividends may qualify for the dividends received\ndeduction available to corporations under Section 243 of the Code and the reduced rate of taxation under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code\nthat applies to qualified dividend income received by noncorporate shareholders. In general, dividends of net investment income\nreceived by corporate shareholders of the Fund qualify for the dividends received deduction generally available to corporations only to\nthe extent of the amount of eligible dividends received by the Fund from domestic corporations (other than REITs) for the taxable year.\nQualified dividend income received by noncorporate shareholders is taxed at rates equivalent to long-term capital gain tax rates.\nQualified dividend income generally includes dividends from domestic corporations and dividends from foreign corporations that meet\ncertain specified criteria, although dividends paid by REITs will not generally be eligible for treatment as qualified dividend income.\nThe Fund generally can pass the tax treatment of dividends eligible for the dividends received deduction and qualified dividend income\nit receives through to Fund shareholders. For the Fund to receive dividends eligible for the dividends received deduction and qualified\ndividend income, the Fund must meet certain holding period and other requirements with respect to the stock on which the dividend is\npaid. In addition, the Fund cannot be obligated to make payments (pursuant to a short sale or otherwise) with respect to substantially\nsimilar or related property. The\n49\nsame provisions, including the holding period requirements, apply to each shareholder’s investment in the Fund for the dividends\nreceived by the shareholder to be eligible for such treatment. Moreover, the dividends received deduction may otherwise be disallowed\nor reduced by application of various provisions of the Code (for instance, the dividends received deduction is reduced in the case of a\ndividend received on debt-financed portfolio stock (generally, stock acquired with borrowed funds)). Distributions of net capital gain, if\nany, that are properly reported as capital gain dividends are generally taxable as long-term capital gains for U.S. federal income tax\npurposes without regard to the length of time the shareholder has held shares of the Fund. A distribution of an amount in excess of the\nFund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, if any, will be treated by a shareholder as a tax-free return of capital which is\napplied against and reduces the shareholder’s basis in his or her shares. Such distributions represent a return of the investor’s capital to\nthe extent of his or her basis in the shares. To the extent that the amount of any such distribution exceeds the shareholder’s basis in his\nor her shares, the excess will be treated by the shareholder as gain from the sale or exchange of shares. The U.S. federal income tax\nstatus of all distributions will be reported to the shareholders annually.\nPursuant to proposed regulations on which the Fund may rely, distributions by the Fund to its shareholders that the Fund properly\nreports as “section 199A dividends,” as defined and subject to certain conditions described below, are treated as qualified REIT\ndividends in the hands of non-corporate shareholders. Non-corporate shareholders are permitted a federal income tax deduction equal to\n20% of qualified REIT dividends received by them, subject to certain limitations. Very generally, a “section 199A dividend” is any\ndividend or portion thereof that is attributable to certain dividends received by a regulated investment company from REITs, to the\nextent such dividends are properly reported as such by the regulated investment company in a written notice to its shareholders. A\nsection 199A dividend is treated as a qualified REIT dividend only if the shareholder receiving such dividend holds the dividend-paying\nregulated investment company shares for at least 46 days of the 91-day period beginning 45 days before the shares become ex-dividend,\nand is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to a position in substantially similar or related property. The Fund\nis permitted to report such part of its dividends as section 199A dividends as are eligible, but is not required to do so.\nIf the Fund retains any net capital gain, the Fund may report the retained amount as undistributed capital gains to shareholders\nwho, if subject to U.S. federal income tax on long-term capital gains, (i) will be required to include in income, as long-term capital gain,\ntheir proportionate share of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their proportionate share of the federal income\ntax paid by the Fund on the undistributed amount against their U.S. federal income tax liabilities, if any, and to claim refunds to the\nextent the credit exceeds such liabilities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax basis of shares owned by a shareholder of the\nFund will be increased by the difference between the amount of undistributed net capital gain included in the shareholder’s gross\nincome and the federal income tax deemed paid by the shareholder.\nIf a shareholder’s distributions are automatically reinvested pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and the plan agent invests\nthe distribution in shares acquired on behalf of the shareholder in open-market purchases, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the\nshareholder will be treated as having received a taxable distribution in the amount of the cash dividend that the shareholder would have\nreceived if the shareholder had elected to receive cash. If a shareholder’s distributions are automatically reinvested pursuant to the\nDividend Reinvestment Plan and the plan agent invests the distribution in newly issued shares of the Fund, the shareholder will\ngenerally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of the shares the shareholder receives.\nAt the time of an investor’s purchase of the Fund’s shares, a portion of the purchase price may be attributable to unrealized\nappreciation in the Fund’s portfolio or undistributed taxable income of the Fund. Consequently, subsequent distributions by the Fund\nwith respect to these shares from such appreciation or income may be taxable to such investor even if the net asset value of the\ninvestor’s shares is, as a result of the distributions, reduced below the investor’s cost for such shares and the distributions economically\nrepresent a return of a portion of the investment.\nAny dividend declared by the Fund in October, November or December with a record date in such a month and paid during the\nfollowing January will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as paid by the Fund and received by shareholders on\nDecember 31 of the calendar year in which it is declared.\n50\nPreferred Share Distributions. Under present law and based in part on the fact that there is and will be no express or implied\nagreement between or among a broker-dealer or any other party, and the Fund or any owners of preferred shares, that the broker-dealer\nor any other party will guarantee or otherwise arrange to ensure that an owner of preferred shares will be able to sell his or her shares,\nthe Fund intends to treat any preferred shares that it issues as stock of the Fund for federal income tax purposes, and, as such,\ndistributions with respect to any preferred shares (other than distributions in redemption of the preferred shares subject to Section 302\n(b) of the Code) will generally constitute dividends to the extent of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, as\ncalculated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Except in the case of net capital gain distributions, such dividends generally will be\ntaxable at ordinary income tax rates to holders of preferred shares but may qualify for the dividends received deduction available to\ncorporate shareholders under Section 243 of the Code and the reduced rates of federal income taxation that apply to qualified dividend\nincome received by noncorporate shareholders under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code. Distributions reported by the Fund as net capital\ngain distributions will be taxable as long-term capital gain regardless of the length of time a shareholder has held shares of the Fund.\nPlease see the discussion above on qualified dividend income, dividends received deductions and net capital gain.\nThe character of the Fund’s income will not affect the amount of dividends which the holders of preferred shares are entitled to\nreceive. If the preferred shares are auction rate securities, holders of preferred shares are entitled to receive only the amount of\ndividends as determined by periodic auctions. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the IRS requires that a regulated investment\ncompany that has two or more classes of shares allocate to each such class proportionate amounts of each type of its income (such as\nordinary income and net capital gain) for each tax year. Accordingly, the Fund intends to report distributions made with respect to the\ncommon shares and preferred shares as consisting of particular types of income (e.g., net capital gain and ordinary income), in\naccordance with each class’s proportionate share of the total dividends paid to both classes. Thus, each year the Fund will report\ndividends qualifying for the corporate dividends received deduction, qualified dividend income, ordinary income and net capital gains\nin a manner that allocates such income between the preferred shares and common shares in proportion to the total dividends made to\neach class with respect to such taxable year, or otherwise as required by applicable law. In addition, solely for the purpose of satisfying\nthe 90% distribution requirement and the distribution requirement for avoiding income taxes, certain distributions made after the close\nof a taxable year of the Fund may be “spilled back” and treated as paid during such taxable year. In such case, shareholders will be\ntreated as having received such dividends in the taxable year in which the distribution was actually made. The Fund intends to treat any\ndividends that are paid following the close of a taxable year as “paid” in the prior year for purposes of determining a class’s\nproportionate share of a particular type of income. The IRS has ruled privately that dividends paid following the close of the taxable\nyear that are treated for federal income tax purposes as derived from income from the prior year will be treated as dividends “paid” in\nthe prior year for purposes of determining the proportionate share of a particular type of income for each class. The private ruling is not\nbinding on the IRS, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will respect such treatment. Each shareholder will be notified of the\nallocation within 60 days after the end of the year.\nAlthough the Fund is required to distribute annually at least 90% of its investment company taxable income (determined without\nregard to the deduction for dividends paid), the Fund is not required to distribute net capital gains to the shareholders. The Fund may\nretain and reinvest such gains and pay federal income taxes on such gains (the “net undistributed capital gain”). Please see the\ndiscussion above on undistributed capital gains. The Fund intends to distribute its net capital gain for any year during which it has\npreferred shares outstanding. Such distribution will affect the tax character but not the amount of dividends to which holders of\npreferred shares are entitled.\nAlthough dividends generally will be treated as distributed when paid, dividends declared in October, November or December\nwith a record date in such a month, and paid in January of the following year, will be treated as having been distributed by the Fund and\nreceived by the shareholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared.\nEarnings and profits are generally treated, for federal income tax purposes, as first being used to pay distributions on preferred\nshares, and then to the extent remaining, if any, to pay distributions on the common shares. Distributions in excess of current and\naccumulated earnings and profits of the Fund are treated first as return of capital to the extent of the shareholder’s basis in the shares\nand, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will be treated as capital gain to a shareholder who holds such shares as a capital asset.\n51\nIf the Fund utilizes leverage through borrowings, or otherwise, asset coverage limitations imposed by the 1940 Act as well as\nadditional restrictions that may be imposed by certain lenders on the payment of dividends or distributions potentially could limit or\neliminate the Fund’s ability to make distributions on its common shares and/or preferred shares until the asset coverage is restored.\nThese limitations could prevent the Fund from distributing at least 90% of its investment company taxable income as is required under\nthe Code and therefore might jeopardize the Fund’s qualification as a regulated investment company and/or might subject the Fund to a\nnondeductible 4% federal excise tax. Upon any failure to meet the asset coverage requirements imposed by the 1940 Act, the Fund may,\nin its sole discretion and to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, purchase or redeem preferred shares in order to maintain or restore\nthe requisite asset coverage and avoid the adverse consequences to the Fund and its shareholders of failing to meet the distribution\nrequirements. There can be no assurance, however, that any such action would achieve these objectives. The Fund will endeavor to\navoid restrictions on its ability to distribute dividends.\nSales of Fund Shares. Sales and other dispositions of the Fund’s shares are taxable events for shareholders that are subject to\nfederal income tax. Selling shareholders will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount\nreceived for such shares and their adjusted tax basis in the shares sold. If such shares are held as a capital asset at the time of sale, the\ngain or loss will generally be a long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year, and, if not held for\nsuch period, a short-term capital gain or loss. Similarly, a repurchase by the Fund, including as a result of a tender offer by the Fund, if\nany, of all of the shares (common and preferred) actually and constructively held by a shareholder generally will give rise to capital gain\nor loss under Section 302(b) of the Code if the shareholder does not own (and is not regarded under certain federal income tax law rules\nof constructive ownership as owning) any other common or preferred shares of the Fund and provided that the proceeds from the\npurchase do not represent declared but unpaid dividends. If the Fund repurchases fewer than all of a shareholder’s common shares or a\nshareholder continues to hold (directly or by attribution) other Fund shares (including preferred shares if then outstanding) subsequent\nto a Fund repurchase, in certain circumstances such shareholder may be treated as having received a distribution under Section 301 of\nthe Code (“Section 301 distribution”) unless the repurchase is treated as being either (i) “substantially disproportionate” with respect to\nsuch shareholder or (ii) otherwise “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” under the relevant rules of the Code. A Section 301\ndistribution is not treated as a sale or exchange giving rise to capital gain or loss, but rather is treated as a dividend to the extent\nsupported by the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, with the excess treated as a return of capital reducing the\nshareholder’s tax basis in its Fund shares, and thereafter as capital gain. Where a selling shareholder is treated as receiving a dividend,\nthere is a risk that non-selling shareholders whose percentage interests in the Fund increase as a result of such repurchase will be treated\nas having received a taxable distribution from the Fund. The extent of such risk will vary depending upon the particular circumstances\nof the repurchase, in particular whether such repurchase is a single and isolated event or is part of a plan for periodically repurchasing\nthe common shares of the Fund; if isolated, any such risk is likely remote.\nGain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain or loss if the shares disposed of were held for more than one year and will be\nshort-term capital gain or loss if the shares disposed of were held for one year or less. Net long-term capital gain recognized by a\nnoncorporate U.S. shareholder generally will be subject to federal income tax at a lower rate than net short-term capital gain or ordinary\nincome. For corporate holders, capital gain is generally taxed for federal income tax purposes at the same rate as ordinary income. A\nholder’s ability to deduct capital losses may be limited.\nAny loss realized by a shareholder upon the sale or other disposition of shares with a tax holding period of six months or less will\nbe treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any amounts treated as distributions of long-term capital gain with respect to such\nshares. Losses on sales or other dispositions of shares may be disallowed under “wash sale” rules in the event a shareholder acquires, or\nis treated as acquiring, substantially identical stock or securities (including Fund shares acquired pursuant to the reinvestment of\ndividends) within a period of 61 days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after a sale or other disposition of shares. In such a\ncase, the disallowed portion of any loss generally would be included in the U.S. federal income tax basis of the shares acquired.\nShareholders should consult their own tax advisers regarding their individual circumstances to determine whether any particular\ntransaction in the Fund’s shares is properly treated as a sale for U.S. federal income tax purposes and the tax treatment of any gains or\nlosses recognized in such transactions.\n52\nUpon the dissolution of the Fund, shareholders generally will realize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference\nbetween the amount of cash or other property received by the shareholder (including any property deemed received by reason of its\nbeing placed in a liquidating trust) and the shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in shares of the Fund for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAny such gain or loss will be long-term if the shareholder is treated as having a holding period in Fund shares of greater than one year,\nand otherwise will be short-term.\nFederal Income Tax Withholding. Federal law requires that the Fund withhold, as “backup withholding,” a percentage of\nreportable payments, including dividends, capital gain distributions and the proceeds of sales or other dispositions of the Fund’s shares\npaid to shareholders who have not complied with IRS regulations. In order to avoid this withholding requirement, shareholders must\ncertify on their account applications, or on a separate IRS Form W-9, that the social security number or other taxpayer identification\nnumber they provide is their correct number and that they are not currently subject to backup withholding, or that they are exempt from\nbackup withholding. The Fund may nevertheless be required to backup withhold if it receives notice from the IRS or a broker that the\nnumber provided is incorrect or backup withholding is applicable. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld\nfrom payments made to a shareholder may be refunded or credited against such shareholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any,\nprovided that the required information is furnished to the IRS.\nOther Matters. Treasury regulations provide that if a shareholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of $2 million or more in\na single taxable year (or $4 million or more in any combination of taxable years) for a shareholder who is an individual, S corporation\nor trust or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder in any single taxable year (or $20 million or more in any combination of\ntaxable years), the shareholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities\nare in many cases excepted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a regulated investment\ncompany are not excepted. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to shareholders of most or\nall regulated investment companies. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of\nwhether the taxpayer’s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine the applicability of\nthese regulations in light of their individual circumstances.\nSpecial tax rules apply to investments through defined contribution plans and other tax-qualified plans. Shareholders should\nconsult their tax advisers to determine the suitability of shares of the Fund as an investment through such plans and the precise effect of\nan investment on their particular tax situation.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Shareholders. The description of certain federal income tax provisions above relates only to U.S. federal\nincome tax consequences for shareholders who are U.S. persons (i.e., U.S. citizens or resident aliens or U.S. corporations, partnerships,\ntrusts or estates who are subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis). Investors other than U.S. persons,\nincluding non-resident alien individuals, may be subject to different U.S. federal income tax treatment. With respect to such persons, the\nFund must generally withhold U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30% (or, if the Fund receives certain certifications from\nsuch non-U.S. shareholder, such lower rate as prescribed by an applicable tax treaty) on amounts treated as ordinary dividends from the\nFund. However, the Fund is not required to withhold tax on any amounts paid to a non-U.S. person with respect to capital gain\ndividends (that is, distributions of net capital gain that are properly reported by the Fund as capital gain dividends), dividends\nattributable to “qualified short-term gain” (i.e., the excess of net short-term capital gain over net long-term capital loss) reported as such\nby the Fund and dividends attributable to certain U.S. source interest income of types similar to those not subject to federal withholding\ntax if earned directly by a non-U.S. person, provided such amounts are properly reported by the Fund. Shareholders should consult\ntheir own tax advisers on these matters and on any specific question of U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other applicable tax\nlaws before making an investment in the Fund.\nDebt Securities\nUnder present law, the Fund intends to treat the debt securities as indebtedness for federal income tax purposes, which treatment\nthe discussion below assumes. We intend to treat all payments made with respect to the debt securities consistent with this\ncharacterization. The following discussion assumes that all interest on the debt securities will be qualified stated interest (which is\ngenerally interest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a fixed or qualified floating rate), and that the debt securities will\nhave a fixed maturity date of more than one year from the date of issuance.\n53\nPayments or accruals of interest on debt securities generally will be taxable to holders as ordinary interest income at the time such\ninterest is received (actually or constructively) or accrued, in accordance with the holder’s regular method of accounting for federal\nincome tax purposes.\nInitially, a holder’s tax basis in debt securities acquired generally will be equal to the cost to acquire such debt securities. This\nbasis will be increased by the amounts, if any, that the holder includes in income under the rules governing OID (taking into account\nany acquisition premium that offsets such OID) and market discount, and will be decreased by the amount of any amortized premium\non such debt securities, as discussed below, and any payments on such debt securities other than stated interest. When the holder sells,\nexchanges or redeems any of its debt securities, or otherwise disposes of its debt securities in a taxable transaction, the holder generally\nwill recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the transaction (less any accrued and unpaid interest\n(including any OID), which will be subject to federal income tax as interest in the manner described above) and the tax basis in the debt\nsecurities relinquished.\nExcept as discussed below with respect to market discount, the gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, redemption or other\ntaxable disposition of any debt securities generally will be capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term capital gain\nor loss if the disposed debt securities were held for more than one year and will be short-term capital gain or loss if the disposed debt\nsecurities were held for one year or less. Net long-term capital gain recognized by a noncorporate U.S. holder generally will be subject\nto federal income tax at a lower rate than net short-term capital gain or ordinary income. For corporate holders, capital gain is generally\ntaxed for federal income tax purposes at the same rate as ordinary income. A holder’s ability to deduct capital losses may be limited.\nIf a holder purchases debt securities at a cost greater than their stated redemption price at maturity, plus accrued interest, the\nholder will be considered to have purchased the debt securities at a premium, and generally may elect to amortize this premium as an\noffset to interest income, using a constant yield method, over the remaining term of the debt securities. If the holder makes the election\nto amortize the premium, it generally will apply to all debt instruments held at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the\nelection applies, as well as any debt instruments that were subsequently acquired. In addition, the holder may not revoke the election\nwithout the consent of the IRS. If the holder elects to amortize the premium, it will be required to reduce its tax basis in the debt\nsecurities by the amount of the premium amortized during its holding period. If the holder does not elect to amortize premium, the\namount of premium will be included in the holder’s tax basis in the debt securities. Therefore, if the holder does not elect to amortize\nthe premium and holds the debt securities to maturity, the holder generally will be required to treat the premium as a capital loss when\nthe debt securities are redeemed.\nIf you purchase debt securities at an original issue price that is less than their stated redemption price at maturity by at least the\nstatutory de minimis amount, the debt securities will be treated as being issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The\nstated redemption price at maturity includes all payments on the debt securities other than qualified stated interest, which is generally\ninterest that is unconditionally payable at least annually at a fixed or qualified floating rate. If the debt securities are issued with OID,\nyou will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues over the term of the debt securities on a\nconstant-yield basis, in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income and regardless of your regular method of accounting\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf a holder purchases debt securities that were issued with OID at a cost greater than their issue price and less than or equal to their\nstated redemption price at maturity, the holder will be considered to have purchased the debt securities with acquisition premium. Such\nholder will generally be permitted to reduce the daily portions of OID required to be included in income by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the excess of the holder’s initial basis in the debt securities over the debt securities’ issue price, and the denominator of which\nis the excess of the redemption price at maturity of the debt securities over their issue price.\nIf the holder purchases debt securities in the secondary market at a price that reflects a “market discount,” any principal payments\non, or any gain that the holder realized on the disposition of, the debt securities generally will be treated as ordinary interest income to\nthe extent of the market discount that accrued on the debt securities during the time such debt securities were held. “Market discount” is\ndefined under the Code as, in general, the excess (subject to a statutory de minimis amount) of the stated redemption price at maturity\n(or in the case of an obligation issued with OID, its “revised issue price”) over the purchase price of the debt security. In addition, the\nholder may be\n54\nrequired to defer the deduction of all or a portion of any interest paid on any indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry the\ndebt securities that were acquired at a market discount.\nThe holder may elect to include market discount in gross income currently as it accrues (on either a ratable or constant yield\nbasis), in lieu of treating a portion of any gain realized on a sale of the debt securities as ordinary income. If the holder elects to include\nmarket discount on a current basis, the interest deduction deferral rule described above will not apply and the holder will increase its\nbasis in the debt security by the amount of market discount included in gross income. If the holder does make such an election, it will\napply to all market discount debt instruments acquired on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which the election applies.\nThis election may not be revoked without the consent of the IRS.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding. In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of\nprincipal, interest, and premium, if any, paid on debt securities and to the proceeds of the sale of debt securities paid to U.S. holders\nother than certain exempt recipients (such as certain corporations) provided they establish such exemption. Information reporting\ngenerally will apply to payments of interest on the debt securities to non-U.S. Holders (as defined below) and the amount of tax, if any,\nwithheld with respect to such payments. Copies of the information returns reporting such interest payments and any withholding may\nalso be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. Holder resides under the provisions of an applicable\nincome tax treaty. In addition, for non-U.S. Holders, information reporting will apply to the proceeds of the sale of debt securities\nwithin the United States or conducted through United States-related financial intermediaries unless the certification requirements\ndescribed below have been complied with and the statement described below in “Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders” has been received (and\nthe payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that the holder is a United States person) or the holder otherwise\nestablishes an exemption.\nWe may be required to withhold, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a portion of all payments (including redemption proceeds)\npayable to holders of debt securities who fail to provide us with their correct taxpayer identification number, who fail to make required\ncertifications or who have been notified by the IRS that they are subject to backup withholding (or if we have been so notified). Certain\ncorporate and other shareholders specified in the Code and the regulations thereunder are exempt from backup withholding. Backup\nwithholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld may be credited against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability\nprovided the appropriate information is furnished to the IRS.\nIf a holder is a non-U.S. Holder, it may have to comply with certification procedures to establish its non-U.S. status in order to\navoid backup withholding tax requirements. The certification procedures required to claim the exemption from withholding tax on\ninterest income described below with respect to non-U.S. Holders will satisfy these requirements.\nTaxation of Non-U.S. Holders. If a holder is a non-resident alien individual or a foreign corporation (a “non-U.S. Holder”), the\npayment of interest on the debt securities generally will be considered “portfolio interest” and thus generally will be exempt from U.S.\nfederal withholding tax. This exemption will apply to the holder provided that (1) interest paid on the debt securities is not effectively\nconnected with the holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (2) the holder is not a bank whose receipt of interest on\nthe debt securities is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (3) the holder does not actually or constructively own 10 percent or\nmore of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote, (4) the holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that\nis related, directly or indirectly, to us through stock ownership, and (5) the holder satisfies the certification requirements described\nbelow.\n55\nTo satisfy the certification requirements, either (1) the holder of any debt securities must certify, under penalties of perjury, that\nsuch holder is a non-U.S. person and must provide such owner’s name, address and taxpayer identification number, if any, on IRS\nForm W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, or (2) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customer securities\nin the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the debt securities on behalf of the holder thereof must certify, under penalties\nof perjury, that it has received a valid and properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E from the beneficial holder and comply\nwith certain other requirements. Special certification rules apply for debt securities held by a foreign partnership and other\nintermediaries.\nInterest on debt securities received by a non-U.S. Holder that is not excluded from U.S. federal withholding tax under the portfolio\ninterest exemption as described above generally will be subject to withholding at a 30% rate, except where (1) the interest is effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, in which case the interest will be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis as\napplicable to U.S. holders generally (and, in the case of corporate non-U.S. Holders, may be subject to an additional 30% branch profits\ntax) or (2) a non-U.S. Holder can claim the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty to reduce or eliminate such withholding tax. To\nclaim the benefit of an income tax treaty or to claim an exemption from withholding because the interest is effectively connected with a\nU.S. trade or business, a non-U.S. Holder must timely provide the appropriate, properly executed IRS forms. These forms may be\nrequired to be periodically updated. Also, a non-U.S. Holder who is claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty may be required to\nobtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and to provide certain documentary evidence issued by foreign governmental authorities to\nprove residence in the foreign country.\nAny capital gain that a non-U.S. Holder realizes on a sale, exchange or other disposition of debt securities generally will be\nexempt from U.S. federal income tax, including withholding tax. This exemption will not apply to a holder if their gain is effectively\nconnected with the conduct of a trade or business in the U.S. or the holder is an individual holder and is present in the U.S. for a period\nor periods aggregating 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and, in each case, certain other conditions are met.\nSee “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” above for a general discussion of information reporting and backup\nwithholding requirements applicable to non-U.S. Holders.\nOther Tax Matters\nMedicare Tax on Certain Investment Income. Certain noncorporate taxpayers are subject to an additional tax of 3.8% with respect\nto the lesser of (1) their “net investment income” (or undistributed “net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust) or (2) the\nexcess of their “modified adjusted gross income” over a threshold amount ($250,000 for married persons filing jointly and $200,000 for\nsingle taxpayers). For this purpose, “net investment income” includes interest, dividends (including dividends paid with respect to\nshares), annuities, royalties, rent, net gain attributable to the disposition of property not held in a trade or business (including net gain\nfrom the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of shares) and certain other income, but will be reduced by any deductions properly\nallocable to such income or net gain.\nOther Reporting and Withholding Requirements. Sections 1471-1474 of the Code and the U.S. Treasury and IRS guidance issued\nthereunder (collectively, “FATCA”) generally require the Fund to obtain information sufficient to identify the status of each of its\nshareholders and holders of its debt securities under FATCA or under an applicable intergovernmental agreement (an “IGA”) between\nthe United States and a foreign government. If a shareholder or holder of debt securities fails to provide the required information or\notherwise fails to comply with FATCA or an IGA, the Fund may be required to withhold under FATCA at a rate of 30% with respect to\nthat holder on ordinary dividends and interest payments. The IRS and the Department of Treasury have issued proposed regulations\nproviding that these withholding rules will not be applicable to the gross proceeds of share redemptions or capital gains dividends that\nthe Fund pays. If a payment by the Fund is subject to FATCA withholding, the Fund is required to withhold even if such payment\nwould otherwise be exempt from withholding under the rules applicable to non-U.S. persons. Each prospective investor is urged to\nconsult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of FATCA and any other reporting requirements with respect to the prospective\ninvestor’s own situation, including investments through an intermediary.\n56\nShareholders that are U.S. persons and own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the Fund could be required to report annually\ntheir “financial interest” in the Fund’s “foreign financial accounts,” if any, on FinCEN Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial\nAccounts (FBAR). Shareholders should consult a tax adviser regarding the applicability to them of this reporting requirement.\nAlternative Minimum Tax\nInvestors may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax on their income (including taxable income from the Fund),\ndepending on their individual circumstances.\nCUSTODIAN, TRANSFER AGENT, DIVIDEND DISBURSING AGENT AND REGISTRAR\nThe Fund’s securities and cash are held under a custodian agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company, 200 Clarendon\nStreet, P.O.

In our opinion, the financial statement presents fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Fund as of October 15, 2019 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThis financial statement is the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Fund’s\nfinancial statement based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight\nBoard (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Fund in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statement is free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The\nFund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our\naudit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an\nopinion on the effectiveness of the Fund’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statement, whether due to error or\nfraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding\nthe amounts and disclosures in the financial statement. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant\nestimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statement. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nOctober 21, 2019\nChicago, Illinois\nWe have served as the auditor of one or more Calamos investment companies since 2003.\n58\nCALAMOS LONG/SHORT EQUITY & DYNAMIC INCOME TRUST\nSTATEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nOctober 15, 2019\nASSETS\nCash with custodian (non-interest bearing) $140,000\nTotal assets 140,000\nLIABILITIES AND NET ASSETS\nNET ASSETS 140,000\nANALYSIS OF NET ASSETS\nPaid in capital 140,000\nNET ASSETS $140,000\nShares outstanding (a) 7,194.24\nNet asset value and redemption price per share $ 19.46\na No par value, unlimited number of shares authorized.\nNOTES\n1.

The Fund estimates that it will issue common shares in its initial\noffering at an aggregate offering price of $300,000,000.\n2. Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from\nthese estimates.\n3. Agreements\nThe Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Calamos Advisors, which provides for payment of a monthly\nfee computed at the annual rate of 1.35% of the Fund’s average weekly managed assets. “Managed assets” means the total assets of the\nFund (including any assets attributable to any financial leverage that may be outstanding) minus the sum of liabilities (other than debt\nrepresenting financial leverage).\nThe Fund will reimburse Calamos Advisors for a portion of compensation paid to the Trust’s Chief Compliance Officer.\nA trustee and certain officers of the Fund are also officers and directors of Calamos Advisors. Such trustee and officers serve\nwithout direct compensation from the Fund.\n59\n4.

However, the ratings\nare general and are not absolute standards of quality or guarantees as to the creditworthiness of an issuer. Consequently, Calamos\nbelieves that the quality of debt securities in which the Fund invests should be continuously reviewed. A rating is not a recommendation\nto purchase, sell or hold a security, because it does not take into account market value or suitability for a particular investor. When a\nsecurity has received a rating from more than one service, each rating should be evaluated independently. Ratings are based on current\ninformation furnished by the issuer or obtained by the ratings services from other sources that they consider reliable. Ratings may be\nchanged, suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information, or for other reasons.\nThe following is a description of the characteristics of ratings used by Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Standard &\nPoor’s Corporation, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies (“S&P”).\nMoody’s Global Short-Term Rating Scale\nP-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\nP-2: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\nP-3: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations.\nNP: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.\nMoody’s Global Long-Term Rating Scale\nAaa: Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, subject to the lowest level of credit risk.\nAa: Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.\nA: Obligations rated A are judged to be upper-medium-grade and are subject to low credit risk.\nBaa: Obligations rated Baa are judged to be medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and as such may possess certain\nspeculative characteristics.\nBa: Obligations rated Ba are judged to be speculative and are subject to substantial credit risk.\nB: Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.\nCaa: Obligations rated Caa are judged to be speculative of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.\nCa: Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal\nand interest.\nC: Obligations rated C are the lowest rated and are typically in default, with little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.\nNote: Moody’s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 in each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1\nindicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the\nmodifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating\nA-1\ncategory. Additionally, a “(hyb)” indicator is appended to all ratings of hybrid securities issued by banks, insurers, finance companies,\nand securities firms.*\n1 The ratings indicated herein are believed to be the most recent ratings available at the date of this prospectus for the securities\nlisted. Ratings are generally given to securities at the time of issuance. While the rating agencies may from time to time revise\nsuch ratings, they undertake no obligation to do so, and the ratings indicated do not necessarily represent ratings which will be\ngiven to these securities on the date of the fund’s fiscal year-end.\n* By their terms, hybrid securities allow for the omission of scheduled dividends, interest, or principal payments, which can\npotentially result in impairment if such an omission occurs. Hybrid securities may also be subject to contractually allowable\nwrite-downs of principal that could result in impairment. Together with the hybrid indicator, the long-term obligation rating\nassigned to a hybrid security is an expression of the relative credit risk associated with that security.\nS&P Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings\nA-1: A short-term obligation rated ‘A-1’ is rated in the highest category by S&P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitments on the obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This\nindicates that the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.\nA-2: A short-term obligation rated ‘A-2’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and\neconomic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitment on\nthe obligation is satisfactory.\nA-3: A short-term obligation rated ‘A-3’ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or\nchanging circumstances are more likely to weaken an obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation.\nB: A short-term obligation rated ‘B’ is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties that could lead to the obligor’s inadequate\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments.\nC: A short-term obligation rated ‘C’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial,\nand economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.\nD: A short-term obligation rated ‘D’ is in default or breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the ‘D’\nrating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&P Global Ratings believes that such\npayments will be made within any stated grace period. However, any stated grace period longer than five business days will be treated\nas five business days. The ‘D’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action and\nwhere default on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. A rating on an obligation is lowered\nto ‘D’ if it is subject to a distressed exchange offer.\nS&P Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings\nAAA: An obligation rated ‘AAA’ has the highest rating assigned by S&P Global Ratings. The obligor’s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitments on the obligation is extremely strong.\nAA: An obligation rated ‘AA’ differs from the highest rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligor’s capacity to meet its\nfinancial commitments on the obligation is very strong.\nA: An obligation rated ‘A’ is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic\nconditions than obligations in higher rated categories. However, the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitments on the\nobligation is still strong.\nA-2\nBBB: An obligation rated ‘BBB’ exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing\ncircumstances are more likely to weaken the obligor’s capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation.\nObligations rated ‘BB’, ‘B’, ‘CCC’, ‘CC’, and ‘C’ are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. ‘BB’ indicates\nthe least degree of speculation and ‘C’ the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics,\nthese may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposure to adverse conditions.\nBB: An obligation rated ‘BB’ is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing\nuncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions that could lead to the obligor’s inadequate capacity to\nmeet its financial commitments on the obligation.\nB: An obligation rated ‘B’ is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated ‘BB’, but the obligor currently has the\ncapacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the\nobligor’s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitments on the obligation.\nCCC: An obligation rated ‘CCC’ is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and\neconomic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitments on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or\neconomic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation.\nCC: An obligation rated ‘CC’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The ‘CC’ rating is used when a default has not yet\noccurred but S&P Global Ratings expects default to be a virtual certainty, regardless of the anticipated time to default.\nC: An obligation rated ‘C’ is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment, and the obligation is expected to have lower relative\nseniority or lower ultimate recovery compared with obligations that are rated higher.\nD: An obligation rated ‘D’ is in default or in breach of an imputed promise. For non-hybrid capital instruments, the ‘D’ rating\ncategory is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due, unless S&P Global Ratings believes that such payments\nwill be made within five business days in the absence of a stated grace period or within the earlier of the stated grace period or\n30 calendar days. The ‘D’ rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of similar action and where\ndefault on an obligation is a virtual certainty, for example due to automatic stay provisions. An obligation’s rating is lowered to ‘D’ if it\nis subject to a distressed exchange offer.\nPlus (+) or Minus (–): The ratings from ‘AA’ to ‘CCC’ may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show\nrelative standing within the rating categories.\nA-3"
