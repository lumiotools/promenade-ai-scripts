(“Patriot,” “Bancorp” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced net loss of $546 thousand, or $(0.14) basic and diluted loss per share for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThese results compared to net loss of $53 thousand, or $(0.01) per basic and diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2023 and net income of $1.3 million, or $0.32 basic and diluted earnings per share reported in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, net loss was $599 thousand, or $(0.15) basic and diluted loss per share, compared to a net income of $2.1 million, or $0.52 basic and diluted earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2022.\n\nThe first half year of 2023 financial results were adversely impacted by increasing reserves, which resulted in an elevated provision for credit losses of $2.6 million, compared to provision for loan losses of $275 thousand recorded for the same period of 2022; and the impact of lower net interest margin which was impacted by the higher funding costs resulting from the recent uncertainty in the banking sector.\n\nThe Bank reported steady loan growth of almost 6% in the second quarter of 2023, as compared to the prior quarter. Net interest margin decreased slightly, but remained strong at 2.96%.\n\n**Commenting on the results, Patriot President & CEO David Lowery, stated**: “The Bank continued to invest in its long-term strategic plan and numerous value-add initiatives during the second quarter of 2023, which, combined with higher loan loss reserves and increased interest expense, from the extraordinary actions taken to combat inflation, resulted in a loss for the quarter. We believe that as the Bank fully ramps up its many initiatives, particularly the Digital Payments Division, the Bank will have the tools necessary for long-term sustained growth, even during challenged markets.\n\nThough the speed of recent interest rate increases may have knock-on effects that require further reserve increases, fresh market signals indicate the need for continued increases may be slowing. Over the long term, the Bank’s in-process investments are expected to more than offset impacts from increased rates, driven by low-cost deposit and fee income generators.\n\nIn the near term, as these programs continue to build out, the Bank will refocus efforts on credit quality and continue to manage non-interest expense. Additionally, the Bank continues to actively pursue a number of strategic actions that will position us for further growth opportunities.”\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\nTotal assets increased to $1.2 billion, as of June 30, 2023, as compared to $1.0 billion on December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to an increase in loans from $848.3 million at December 31, 2022, to $930.7 million as of June 30, 2023. Total deposits for the quarter remained stable at $863.4 million as of June 30, 2023, relative to $860.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nNet interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $7.7 million, which was consistent with the net interest income of $7.7 million reported in the second quarter of 2022 and a decline from $8.0 million reported in the first quarter of 2023. The decline from the first quarter of 2023 was due to narrower net interest margin due to higher deposit costs and an increase in wholesale borrowings. Net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2023 was $15.7 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 8.9% from the first half of 2022. These increases were primarily attributable to the growth in the loan portfolio over the past year.\n\nThe Bank’s net interest margin was 2.96% for the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with 3.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 3.27% for the three months ended June 30, 2022. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the net interest margin was 3.12% and 3.17%, respectively.\n\nA provision for credit losses of $1.2 million and $2.6 million was recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, a provision for loan losses of $275 thousand was recorded. The allowance and provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 are not comparable to prior periods due to adoption of the current expected credit loss methodology.\n\nNon-interest income was $829 thousand and $798 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the non-interest income was $1.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The higher non-interest income for the first half of 2023, was primarily attributable to higher non-interest income from the Bank’s Deposit Strategies Division.\n\nNon-interest expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, were $8.1 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Non-interest expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022, were $15.6 million and $12.9 million, respectively.\n\nIn 2023, a benefit for income taxes of $206 thousand and $225 thousand was recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to a provision for income taxes of $476 thousand and $787 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was 27.3% and 27.6%, respectively.\n\n**About the Company:**\n\nFounded in 1994, and now celebrating its 29th year, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc.

A computation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used for these purposes is contained in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures tables. We believe that due to the temporary nature of the change in AFS securities which is a result of the current interest rate environment, providing the Book value per share data excluding the Other Comprehensive Loss associated with the valuation of AFS securities provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial position. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (unaudited):**\n\n**_(Dollars in thousands)_ ** |  **June 30, 2023** |  **March 31, 2023** |  **June 30, 2022**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Tangible book value per share**  \nTotal shareholders' equity | $ | 52,445 | $ | 54,609 | $ | 59,802  \nGoodwill | (1,107 | ) | (1,107 | ) | (1,107 | )  \nCore deposit intangible, net | (226 | ) | (238 | ) | (273 | )  \n**Tangible book value** |  **$** |  **51,112** |  **$** |  **53,264** |  **$** |  **58,422**  \nShares outstanding | 3,965,186 | 3,965,186 | 3,957,269  \n**Tangible book value per share** |  **$** |  **12.89** |  **$** |  **13.43** |  **$** |  **14.76**  \n**Tangible book value excluding other comprehensive loss per share**  \nTangible book value | $ | 51,112 | $ | 53,264 | $ | 58,422  \nOther comprehensive loss | 16,039 | 14,398 | 11,285  \n**Tangible book value excluding other comprehensive loss** |  **$** |  **67,151** |  **$** |  **67,662** |  **$** |  **69,707**  \nShares outstanding | 3,965,186 | 3,965,186 | 3,957,269  \n**Tangible book value excluding other comprehensive loss per share** |  **$** |  **16.94** |  **$** |  **17.06** |  **$** |  **17.61**  \n  \n**Contacts:**  \n---  \nPatriot Bank, N.A. | Joseph Perillo | David Lowery  \n900 Bedford Street | Chief Financial Officer | President & CEO  \nStamford, CT 06901 | 203-252-5954 | 203-252-5959  \n[www.BankPatriot.com](http://www.BankPatriot.com)  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=ODg5MzE1NCM1NzUyNDcyIzIwMjg2NzA=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/NDU2MTgxNjgtZThkNi00MjUyLWEwZGItMWJhNzJhODhkZDA2LTEwMzk1NDk=/tiny/Patriot-National-Bancorp-Inc-.png)\n\n[ ![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/4f3fc95e-c781-4a9e-ae10-f6f9cb451c1c/small/patriot-bank-logo.jpg) ](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4f3fc95e-c781-4a9e-ae10-f6f9cb451c1c)\n\nSource: Patriot National Bancorp Inc. \n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n[ ](javascript:;) [ ](javascript:;) [ ](javascript:;) [ ](/resources/email-notification/default.aspx)\n"

(“Patriot,” “Bancorp” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced net loss of $53.0 thousand, or $(0.01) basic and diluted loss per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.\n\nThese results compared to net income of $1.8 million, or $0.45 per basic and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 and net income of $800 thousand, or $0.20 basic and diluted earnings per share reported in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe first quarter of 2023 financial results were adversely impacted by increasing reserves, which resulted in an elevated provision for credit losses of $1.3 million, compared to no provision for loan losses recorded for the first quarter of 2022; and the impact of lower net interest margin which was impacted by the higher funding costs resulting from the recent uncertainty in the banking sector.\n\nThe Bank reported steady quarterly loan growth of 3.6%, as compared to December 31, 2022. Net interest margin remained strong at 3.29%. The Bank continued executing its, low-cost deposit gathering strategies to complement its branch franchise. Prepaid deposits have grown to $176.2 million as of March 31, 2023. The combination of timing events associated with the onboarding of new deposit channels and rate increases in the Bank’s steady state deposit funding has resulted in a decrease in net interest margin from the previous quarter. Net interest margin decreased 48bps from 3.77% reported in the fourth quarter of 2022, but increased 23bps from 3.06% for the first quarter of last year. The Bank’s prepaid debit card and deposit strategy programs are expected to increasingly become significant contributors to the Bank’s diversified funding sources.\n\n**Patriot President & CEO David Lowery stated**: \"I am excited to have been promoted to Patriot’s President and CEO and look forward to providing increased value to our customers, driving shareholder returns, and establishing Patriot as a preferred work environment for our employees. The first quarter of 2023 was a particularly challenging time for banks overall. However, during this period, PNBK made great strides in investing in its future, growing and diversifying its loan book and deposit base year over year, and increasing reserves.”\n\nWhile the full impact of recent investments will take time to flow to the bottom line, the Bank’s strengths can be evidenced by:\n\n1) | A diversified portfolio with no outsized exposures, ending the quarter split between Commercial Loans, Non-Owner-Occupied CRE, and Consumer Loans at 30%, 44% and 25%, respectively.  \n---|---  \n2) | A highly conservative Non-Owner-Occupied CRE portfolio with a weighted average LTV of 47%, and less than 9% of that portfolio attributable to office, land, or construction.  \n3) | Minimal duration risk across all loans; 34% of the loan portfolio is tied to variable rates, and the fixed rate loans have a weighted average term to rate reset of less than a year-and-a-half, so they will reprice if deposit costs continue to increase; and  \n4) | A deposit base, supported by strong relationships, insulated from risk of flight, with more than 60% federally insured and 20% tied to the Bank’s prepaid vertical.  \n  \n**Financial Results:**\n\nTotal assets increased to $1.1 billion, as of March 31, 2023, as compared to $1.0 billion on December 31, 2022. This was primarily due to an increase in loans from $848.3 million at December 31, 2022, to $878.8 million as of March 31, 2023. Total deposits for the quarter remained stable at $856.5 million, relative to $860.4 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, pertaining to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments (\"CECL\"), and as a result, recorded an increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans of $7.4 million, an allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet exposure of $1.1 million, and a cumulative adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit of $6.2 million, net of a deferred tax adjustment of $2.3 million. The adoption of CECL does not impact Patriot’s income statement, but such adoption is reflected in Patriot’s shareholder’s equity.\n\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2023, was $8.0 million, an increase of $1.3 million or 19.1% from the first quarter of 2022 and a decline from $9.6 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase from the prior year first quarter was primarily attributable to the growth in the loan portfolio and growth in prepaid deposits from the Bank’s Deposit Strategies Division. The decline from the fourth quarter of 2022 was due to narrower net interest margin due to higher deposit costs and an increase in wholesale borrowings to purposely increase liquidity.\n\nThe Bank’s net interest margin was 3.29% for the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with 3.77% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 3.06% for the three months ended March 31, 2022.\n\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and 2022 was $835 thousand and $814 thousand, respectively. The higher non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to higher non-interest income from the Bank’s Deposit Strategies Division.\n\nNon-interest expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and 2022, were $7.6 million and $6.4 million, respectively.\n\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2023, a credit for income taxes of $19 thousand was recorded, compared to a provision for income taxes of $311 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 was 26.4% and 28.0%, respectively.\n\n* * * * *\n\n**About the Company:**\n\nFounded in 1994, and now celebrating its 29th year, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are based on Patriot’s current expectations and assumptions regarding Patriot’s business, the economy, and other future conditions.

\n  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures:**\n\nIn addition to evaluating the Company's financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), management may evaluate certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as per share numbers that exclude intangible assets and exclude the net reduction in Book equity resulting from the change in value of its Available for Sale investment securities (AFS). A computation and reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used for these purposes is contained in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures tables. We believe that due to the temporary nature of the change in AFS securities which is a result of the current interest rate environment, providing the Book value per share data excluding the Other Comprehensive Loss associated with the valuation of AFS securities provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial position. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\n\n**Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures (unaudited):**\n\n**_(Dollars in thousands)_ ** |  **March 31, 2023** |  **December 31, 2022** |  **March 31, 2022**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**Tangible book value per share**  \nTotal shareholders' equity | $ | 54,609 | $ | 59,583 | $ | 62,683  \nGoodwill | (1,107 | ) | (1,107 | ) | (1,107 | )  \nCore deposit intangible, net | (238 | ) | (249 | ) | (284 | )  \n**Tangible book value** |  **$** |  **53,264** |  **$** |  **58,227** |  **$** |  **61,292**  \nShares outstanding | 3,965,186 | 3,965,186 | 3,956,492  \n**Tangible book value per share** |  **$** |  **13.43** |  **$** |  **14.68** |  **$** |  **15.49**  \n**Tangible book value excluding other comprehensive loss per share**  \nTangible book value | $ | 53,264 | $ | 58,227 | $ | 61,292  \nOther comprehensive loss | 14,398 | 15,645 | 7,119  \n**Tangible book value excluding other comprehensive loss** |  **$** |  **67,662** |  **$** |  **73,872** |  **$** |  **68,411**  \nShares outstanding | 3,965,186 | 3,965,186 | 3,956,492  \n**Tangible book value excluding other comprehensive loss per share** |  **$** |  **17.06** |  **$** |  **18.63** |  **$** |  **17.29**  \n  \n**Contacts:**  \n---  \nPatriot Bank, N.A. | Joseph Perillo | David Lowery  \n900 Bedford Street | Chief Financial Officer | President & CEO  \nStamford, CT 06901 | 203-252-5954 | 203-252-5959  \n[www.BankPatriot.com](http://www.BankPatriot.com)  \n  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=ODgzODY5NiM1NTkzNDYzIzIwMjg2NzA=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/YTdkOWQxMGUtOTkyYi00NTFmLWI4Y2MtY2IxODRkYTEwMzAxLTEwMzk1NDk=/tiny/Patriot-National-Bancorp-Inc-.png)\n\n[ ![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/4f3fc95e-c781-4a9e-ae10-f6f9cb451c1c/small/patriot-bank-logo.jpg) ](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4f3fc95e-c781-4a9e-ae10-f6f9cb451c1c)\n\nSource: Patriot National Bancorp Inc. \n\nCopyright 2024, [© Powered By Q4 Inc.](http://q4inc.com/Powered-by-Q4/)\n\n[ ](javascript:;) [ ](javascript:;) [ ](javascript:;) [ ](/resources/email-notification/default.aspx)\n"
