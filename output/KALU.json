Hedged cost of alloyed metal for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included $383.6 million and $380.0 million, respectively, reflecting the cost of aluminum at the average Midwest Transaction Price and the cost of alloys used in the production process, as well as metal price exposure on shipments that the Company hedged with realized losses upon settlement of $2.1 million and $6.5 million in the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which were included within both Net sales and Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Income. Hedged cost of alloyed metal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included $1,158.6 million and $1,245.6 million, respectively, reflecting the cost of aluminum at the average Midwest Transaction Price and the cost of alloys used in the production process, as well as metal price exposure on shipments that the Company hedged with realized losses upon settlement of $2.2 million and $14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which were included within both Net sales and Cost of products sold, excluding depreciation and amortization in the Company’s Statements of Consolidated Income.\n  2. Diluted shares for EPS are calculated using the two-class method for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the treasury stock method for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n  3. Adjusted numbers exclude non-run-rate items. For all Adjusted numbers and EBITDA refer to Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures.\n  4. Adjusted EBITDA = Consolidated operating income, excluding operating non-run-rate items, plus Depreciation and amortization.\n  5. Adjusted EBITDA margin = Adjusted EBITDA as a percent of Conversion Revenue.\n\n\n\n* Please refer to GAAP financial statements.\n\nTotals may not sum due to rounding.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\nNet sales for the third quarter 2024 increased to $748 million compared to $744 million in the prior year period, driven primarily by improved pricing.\n\nConversion revenue for the third quarter 2024 was $362 million, reflecting a 1% increase compared to the prior year period.\n\n  * Net sales for aerospace/high strength applications were $213 million, and conversion revenue was $128 million, a 5% decrease driven primarily by a 7% decrease in shipments over the prior year quarter, reflecting the broader supply chain challenges in the market.\n  * Net sales for packaging applications were $320 million, and conversion revenue was $128 million, reflecting a 9% increase over the prior year quarter due mainly to improved product mix and pricing, partially offset by a 2% decrease in shipments as the Company continued to stabilize production levels following the second quarter outage and destocking period earlier in the year. Underlying demand continued to strengthen during the quarter.\n  * Net sales for general engineering applications were $151 million, and conversion revenue was $76 million, reflecting a modest year-over-year increase on a 5% increase in shipments as pricing remained relatively stable despite uneven demand and import pressures.\n  * Net sales for automotive extrusions were $62 million, and conversion revenue was $29 million, reflecting a 3% increase driven by improved pricing and product mix.\n\n\n\nReported net income for the third quarter 2024 was $12 million, or $0.74 income per diluted share, compared to net income and income per diluted share of $5 million and $0.34, respectively, in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of a pre-tax, non-run-rate charge of $4 million and a non-operating, non-run-rate gain of $9 million, adjusted net income was $8 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to adjusted net income of $7 million in the prior year period. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.51 for the third quarter 2024, compared to adjusted net income per diluted share of $0.46 for the third quarter 2023.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $50 million in the third quarter 2024 increased $2 million compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of conversion revenue was 13.9% in the third quarter 2024 compared to 13.3% in the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin for the third quarter 2024 was driven primarily by an increase in conversion revenue, partially offset by an increase in energy costs and a higher GAAP LIFO charge.\n\n**Cash Flow and Liquidity**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA of $166 million reported in the first nine months of 2024 and cash on hand funded $47 million of working capital, $125 million of capital investments, $31 million of interest payments and $38 million of cash returned to stockholders through quarterly dividends.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46 million and borrowing availability under the Company's revolving credit facility of $549 million, providing total liquidity of $595 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024.\n\nOn October 15, 2024, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.77 per share, which will be paid on November 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 25, 2024.\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company expects demand to be consistent with its previous expectations for the balance of 2024. In aerospace/high strength applications, the Company remains cautious on its near-term outlook due to the timing of certain customer commercial and labor negotiations which may have a short-term impact on demand and shipments. In the packaging end market, industry momentum and performance improvements at the Company’s Warrick facility are expected to continue as it nears the completion of its fourth coating line investment, which will drive margin improvement starting in 2025. In general engineering, destocking within the Company’s long products has concluded with shipment levels now in better alignment with end market demand. In automotive extrusions, the Company is maintaining a positive outlook as production for light and heavy truck and sport utility vehicle platforms has outpaced broader automotive production rates.\n\nAccordingly, for the full year 2024, the Company continues to expect overall conversion revenue to remain stable with growth up to 1% compared to 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin, less the full year impact from GAAP LIFO charges, is expected to improve 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2023, as it continues to implement cost reduction measures in its operations, increase manufacturing efficiencies and execute its strategic growth initiatives.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nKaiser Aluminum Corporation will host a conference call on Thursday, October 24, 2024, at 10:00 am (Eastern Time); 9:00 am (Central Time); 7:00 am (Pacific Time), to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.

A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets, or statements of cash flow of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used within this earnings release are conversion revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per diluted share which exclude non-run-rate items and ratios related thereto. As more fully described in these reports, “non-run-rate” items are items that, while they may occur from period to period, are particularly material to results, impact costs primarily as a result of external market factors and may not occur in future periods if the same level of underlying performance were to occur. These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors. Reconciliations of certain forward looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not provided because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of the Company's control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted or provided without unreasonable effort.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains statements based on management’s current expectations, estimates and projections that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 involving known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied. These factors include: (a) the effectiveness of management's strategies and decisions, including strategic investments, capital spending strategies, cost reduction initiatives, sourcing strategies, process and countermeasures implemented to address operational and supply chain challenges, and the execution of those strategies; (b) the execution and timing of strategic investments; (c) general economic and business conditions, including the impact of geopolitical factors and governmental and other actions taken in response, cyclicality, reshoring, labor challenges, supply interruptions, customer operation disruptions, customer inventory imbalances and supply chain issues and other conditions that impact demand drivers in the aerospace/high strength, packaging, general engineering, automotive extrusions and other end markets we serve; (d) the Company’s ability to participate in mature and anticipated new automotive programs expected to launch in the future and successfully launch new automotive programs; (e) changes or shifts in defense spending due to competing national priorities; (f) pricing, market conditions and the Company’s ability to effectively execute its commercial and labor strategies, pass through cost increases, including the institution of surcharges, and flex costs in response to inflation, volatile commodity costs and changing economic conditions; (g) developments in technology; (h) the impact of the Company's future earnings, cash flows, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors on its financial strength and flexibility; (i) new or modified statutory or regulatory requirements; (j) the successful integration of the acquired operations and technologies; (k) stakeholder, including regulator and customer, views regarding the Company's sustainability goals and initiatives and the impact of factors outside of the Company's control on such goals and initiatives; and (l) other risk factors summarized in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission including the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThis Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Unless the\ncontext otherwise requires, references in these notes to interim consolidated financial statements - unaudited to “Kaiser,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and\n“our Company” refer collectively to Kaiser Aluminum Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly\nowned subsidiaries and are prepared in accordance with GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC applicable for interim periods and, therefore, do not\ninclude all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In management’s opinion, all adjustments (which include normal\nrecurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. We have reclassified certain items in prior periods to conform to current\nclassifications. The results of operations for our interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be achieved for the entire\n2024 fiscal year. The financial information as of December 31, 2023 is derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the\nfinancial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates\nand assumptions are inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these\nestimates and assumptions, which could have a material effect on the reported amounts of our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted\nDisclosure Improvements. In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-06 (“ASU 2023-06”),\nCodification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The guidance amends GAAP to reflect updates and\nsimplifications to certain disclosure requirements referred to the FASB by the SEC. The amendments in ASU 2023-06 will become effective on the date which\nthe SEC’s removal of the related disclosure becomes effective. If by June 30, 2027, the SEC does not remove the related disclosure, the pending amendment will\nbe removed from ASC 2023-06 and it will not be effective. Adoption of ASU 2023-06 is expected to modify the disclosure and presentation requirements only\nand is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Reporting. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 (“ASU 2023-07”), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The\nguidance primarily will require enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 and existing segment\ndisclosures in ASC 280, Segment Reporting are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. A\nretrospective approach is required to be applied to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We plan to adopt the provisions of ASU 2023-07 in the\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and continue to evaluate the disclosure requirements related to the new standard.\nIncome Taxes. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 (“ASU 2023-09”), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The guidance is\nintended to improve income tax disclosure requirements by requiring: (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate\nreconciliation and (ii) the disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance makes several other changes to the income tax disclosure\nrequirements. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and is required\nto be applied prospectively with the option of retrospective application. We plan to adopt the provisions of ASU 2023-09 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and\ncontinue to evaluate the disclosure requirements related to the new standard.\n8\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\n2.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we amended the Kaiser Aluminum Warrick pension plan (“Warrick Pension Plan”)\nto clarify certain plan provisions going back to the date of our acquisition of Warrick, which resulted in an interim remeasurement of the Warrick Pension Plan as\nof June 30, 2024. The remeasurement decreased the Warrick Pension Plan’s net funded status by $0.8 million, driven by: (i) a $2.2 million increase in pre-tax\nprior service cost, which we recorded to AOCI and expect to amortize on a straight-line basis over approximately 10 years, and (ii) an actuarial gain of $1.4\nmillion, reflecting an increase in the assumed discount rate. The discount rate assumption used to determine the Warrick Pension Plan benefit obligation was\n5.51% at June 30, 2024 compared to 5.04% at December 31, 2023. There was no change to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at\nJune 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023.\n10\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\nThe Warrick Pension Plan amendment had no effect on our expected contributions for 2024.

During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we initiated a plan to exit our soft alloy aluminum extrusion facility located in\nSherman, Texas (“2024 Restructuring Plan”). Through September 30, 2024, we have recorded a charge of $7.5 million, consisting of a $4.6 million\nmultiemployer pension obligation which is expected to be paid in 2027 and a $2.9 million charge for severance, related benefits, and other costs, to be\nsubstantially paid by December 31, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the total estimated costs related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to range from\n$8.0 million to $10.0 million. The costs are recorded within Restructuring costs in our Statements of Consolidated Income.\nThe following table summarizes activity relating to the 2024 Restructuring Plan liabilities (in millions of dollars):\nBALANCE, March 31, 2024 $ —\nRestructuring costs 6.8\nCosts paid or otherwise settled1 (0.6)\nBALANCE, June 30, 2024 6.2\nRestructuring costs 0.7\nCosts paid or otherwise settled1 (2.1)\nBALANCE, September 30, 2024 $ 4.8\n1.

During 2022, we relocated our corporate headquarters from Foothill Ranch, California (“Foothill Ranch”) to Franklin,\nTennessee (“Franklin”). In conjunction with the relocation, we initiated a restructuring plan during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, which consisted\nprimarily of employee retention benefits aimed at incentivizing Foothill Ranch employees to assist with the buildout of the new corporate function in Franklin\n(“2022 Restructuring Plan”). We incurred total restructuring costs of $7.4 million related to the 2022 Restructuring Plan, which consisted of employee-related\ncosts and office rent within Restructuring costs in our Statements of Consolidated Income.

In conducting our business, we enter into derivative transactions, including forward contracts and options, to limit our exposure to: (i) metal\nprice risk related to our sale of fabricated aluminum products and the purchase of metal, including primary, rolling ingot and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our\nmain raw material, and certain alloys used as raw material for our fabrication operations; (ii) energy price risk related to fluctuating prices of natural gas and\nelectricity used in our production processes; and (iii) foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equipment and service agreements with vendors for\nwhich payments are due in foreign currency. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Hedging transactions are\nexecuted centrally on behalf of all of our operations to minimize transaction costs, monitor consolidated net exposures, and allow for increased responsiveness to\nchanges in market factors.\nOur derivative activities are overseen by a committee (“Hedging Committee”), which is composed of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial\nOfficer, Chief Accounting Officer, Treasurer, Executive Vice President of Manufacturing and other officers and employees selected by the Chief Executive\nOfficer. The Hedging Committee meets regularly to review commodity price exposures, derivative positions and strategy. Management reviews the scope of the\nHedging Committee’s activities with our Board of Directors.\nWe are exposed to counterparty credit risk on all of our derivative instruments, which we manage by monitoring the credit quality of our counterparties\nand allocating our hedging positions among multiple counterparties to limit exposure to any single entity. Our counterparties are major investment grade\nfinancial institutions or trading companies, and our hedging transactions are governed by negotiated International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master\nAgreements, which generally require collateral to be posted by our counterparties above specified credit thresholds which may adjust up or down, based on\nincreases or decreases in counterparty credit ratings. As a result, we believe the risk of loss is remote and contained. The aggregate fair value of our derivative\ninstruments that were in a net liability position was $2.0 million and $1.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and we had no\ncollateral posted as of those dates.\nIn addition, our firm-price customer sales commitments create incremental customer credit risk related to metal price movements. Under certain\ncircumstances, we mitigate this risk by periodically requiring cash collateral to be posted by our customers, which we classify as deferred revenue and include as\na component of Other accrued liabilities. We had no material cash collateral posted by our customers at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate as cash flow hedges forward swap contracts for aluminum and energy. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we adopted this treatment\nfor Alloying Metals used in our fabrication operations. We also designate as cash flow hedges foreign currency forward contracts for equipment and services for\nwhich payments are due in foreign currency. Unrealized gains and losses associated with our cash flow hedges are deferred in Other comprehensive income\n(loss), net of tax, and reclassified to COGS when such hedges\n12\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\nsettle or when it is probable that the original forecasted transactions will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period. See Note 8 for the total\namount of gain or loss on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedging instruments that was reported in AOCI, as well as the related\nreclassifications into earnings and tax effects. Cumulative gains and losses related to cash flow hedges are reclassified out of AOCI and recorded within COGS\nwhen the associated hedged commodity purchases impact earnings.\nAluminum Hedges. Our pricing of fabricated aluminum products is generally intended to lock in our Conversion Revenue (representing our value added\nfrom the fabrication process) and to pass through aluminum price fluctuations to our customers. For some of our higher margin products sold on a spot basis, the\npass through of aluminum price movements can sometimes lag by as much as several months, with a favorable impact to us when aluminum prices decline and\nan adverse impact to us when aluminum prices increase. Additionally, in certain instances, we enter into firm-price arrangements with our customers for\nstipulated volumes to be delivered in the future. Because we generally purchase primary and secondary aluminum on a floating price basis, the lag in passing\nthrough aluminum price movements to customers on some of our higher margin products sold on a spot basis and the volume that we have committed to sell to\nour customers under a firm-price arrangement create aluminum price risk for us. We use third-party hedging instruments to limit exposure to aluminum price\nrisk related to the aluminum pass through lag on some of our products and firm-price customer sales contracts.\nAlloying Metals Hedges. We are exposed to the risk of fluctuating prices for alloying metals used as raw materials in our fabrication operations. We, from\ntime to time, in the ordinary course of business, enter into hedging transactions and/or physical delivery commitments with third parties to mitigate our risk from\nfluctuations in certain alloying metals prices that are not passed through pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts.\nEnergy Hedges. We are exposed to the risk of fluctuating prices for natural gas and electricity. We, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business,\nenter into hedging transactions and/or firm-price physical delivery commitments with third parties to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in natural gas and\nelectricity prices that are not passed through pursuant to the terms of our customer contracts.\nForeign Currency Hedges. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain equipment and service agreements with vendors for\nwhich payments are due in foreign currency. We, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, use foreign currency forward contracts in order to\nmitigate the exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to these purchases.\nNon-Designated Hedges of Operational Risks\nFrom time to time, we enter into commodity and foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments to mitigate certain\nshort‑term impacts, as identified. The gain or loss on these commodity and foreign currency derivatives is recognized within COGS and Other income (expense),\nnet, respectively.\nNotional Amount of Derivative Contracts\nThe following table summarizes our derivative positions at September 30, 2024:\nNotional Amount of\nAluminum Maturity Period Contracts (mmlbs)\nFixed price purchase contracts for LME October 2024 through February 2026 61.2\nFixed price sale contracts for LME October 2024 9.4\nFixed price purchase contracts for MWTP October 2024 through February 2026 50.2\nFixed price sale contracts for MWTP October 2024 9.3\nNotional Amount of Contracts\nAlloying Metals Maturity Period (mmlbs)\nFixed price purchase contracts October 2024 through December 2026 9.7\nNotional Amount of Contracts\nNatural Gas Maturity Period (mmbtu)\nFixed price purchase contracts October 2024 through December 2026 3,080,000\n13\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\nNotional Amount of Contracts\nElectricity Maturity Period (Mwh)\nFixed price purchase contracts October 2024 through December 2024 55,225\nFixed price sale contracts October 2024 through December 2024 28,717\nNotional Amount of Contracts\nEuro Maturity Period (EUR)\nFixed price forward purchase contracts October 2024 through July 2027 10,482,824\nNotional Amount of Contracts\nBritish Pounds Maturity Period (GBP)\nFixed price forward purchase contracts October 2024 72,266\nLoss (Gain) on Derivative Contracts\nThe following table summarizes the amount of loss (gain) on derivative contracts recorded within our Statements of Consolidated Income in COGS (in\nmillions of dollars):\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nTotal of income and expense line items presented in our Statements of\nConsolidated Income in which the effects of hedges are recorded:\nCash flow hedges $ 671.8 $ 665.2 $ 2,005.2 $ 2,114.7\nLoss (gain) recognized in our Statements of Consolidated Income\nrelated to cash flow hedges:\nAluminum $ 1.6 $ 4.4 $ 0.9 $ 10.1\nAlloying Metals (0.3) — (0.8) —\nNatural gas 0.3 0.1 1.0 0.1\nElectricity — — 0.6 —\nForeign exchange contracts (0.1) — (0.1) —\nTotal loss recognized in our Statements of Consolidated Income\nrelated to cash flow hedges $ 1.5 $ 4.5 $ 1.6 $ 10.2\nLoss (gain) recognized in our Statements of Consolidated Income\nrelated to non-designated derivatives:\nAlloying Metals – Realized loss $ — $ 0.1 $ — $ 0.1\nAlloying Metals – Unrealized mark-to-market gain — (0.3) — (0.2)\nElectricity – Realized loss 2.0 — 2.0 —\nElectricity – Unrealized mark-to-market loss — — 2.0 —\nElectricity (reclassification from AOCI due to forecasted\ntransactions probable of not occurring) — — 0.2 —\nTotal loss (gain) recognized in our Statements of Consolidated Income\nrelated to non-designated derivatives $ 2.0 $ (0.2) $ 4.2 $ (0.1)\n14\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\nFair Values of Derivative Contracts\nThe fair values of our derivative contracts are based upon trades in liquid markets.

Joining us as borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility are four of our wholly owned\ndomestic operating subsidiaries: (i) Kaiser Aluminum Investments Company; (ii) Kaiser Aluminum Fabricated Products, LLC; (iii) Kaiser Aluminum\nWashington, LLC; and (iv) Kaiser Aluminum Warrick, LLC.\nAs amended in April 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility contains a maximum commitment amount of $575.0 million (of which up to a maximum of\n$50.0 million may be utilized for letters of credit) and is set to mature in April 2027. Our effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the amended\nRevolving Credit Facility is based on the rates of Base Rate Loans and SOFR Loans (as defined in the amended Revolving Credit Facility). The rate for Base\nRate Loans is equal to the prevailing Prime Rate plus 0.25%, while the rate for SOFR Loans, which are made for one or three month periods, is equal to the\nTerm SOFR Reference Rate (as defined in the amended Revolving Credit Facility) plus 1.35%. Outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are\nreported within Long-term debt, net, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We had no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024.

Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments. We have a variety of financial commitments, including purchase agreements, forward foreign exchange and forward sales contracts,\nindebtedness and letters of credit (see Note 5 and Note 6).\nEnvironmental Contingencies. We are subject to a number of environmental laws and regulations, potential fines or penalties assessed for alleged\nbreaches of such laws and regulations and potential claims based upon such laws and regulations. We are also subject to legacy environmental contingencies\nrelated to activities that occurred at operating facilities prior to July 6, 2006, which represent the majority of our environmental accruals. The status of these\nenvironmental contingencies are discussed below. We have established procedures for regularly evaluating environmental loss contingencies. Our environmental\naccruals represent our undiscounted estimate of costs reasonably expected to be incurred based on presently enacted laws and regulations, currently available\nfacts, existing requirements, existing technology and our assessment of the likely remediation actions to be taken.\nWe continue to pursue remediation activities, primarily to address the historical use of oils containing polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”) at Trentwood.\nOur remediation efforts are in collaboration with the Washington State Department of Ecology (“Ecology”), to which we submitted a feasibility study in 2012 of\nremediation alternatives and from which we received permission to begin certain remediation activities pursuant to a signed work order. We have completed a\nnumber of sections of the work plan and have received satisfactory completion approval from Ecology on those sections. In cooperation with Ecology, we\nconstructed an experimental treatment facility to determine the treatability and evaluate the feasibility of removing PCBs from ground water under Trentwood.\nIn 2015, we began treatment operations involving a walnut shell filtration system, which we optimized for maximum PCB capture during 2020. Furthermore,\nbased on advancements in technology, we signed an Amended Agreed Order with Ecology to evaluate and implement a new Ultraviolet Light Advanced\nOxidation Process (“UV/AOP”) for PCB removal from groundwater on a pilot basis. We completed technology evaluations to remove PCBs in groundwater and\nthe UV/AOP proved to be successful. Therefore, in 2024 a full-scale UV/AOP treatment system was constructed. We are currently completing documentation\nwith Ecology as required by the Amended Agreed Order.\nPursuant to a consent agreement with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (“OEPA”), we initiated an investigational study of Newark related to\nhistorical on-site waste disposal. During the quarter ended December 31, 2018, we submitted our remedial investigation study to the OEPA for review and\napproval. The final remedial investigation report was approved by the OEPA during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. During the quarter ended December\n31, 2023, we submitted an Alternate Arrays Document (“AAD”) to the OEPA for review. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, based on input from the\nOEPA and the proposed remediation options included in the AAD, we increased our accrual by $2.9 million. This increase reflects updated preliminary estimates\nfor the most likely remediation activities, as laid out in the AAD. Once the AAD is reviewed and accepted by the OEPA, we plan to submit our feasibility study\nto the OEPA, which we expect to occur in early 2025.\nAt September 30, 2024, our environmental accrual of $18.1 million represented our estimate of the incremental remediation cost based on: (i) proposed\nalternatives in the final feasibility study related to Trentwood; (ii) currently available facts with respect to Newark; and (iii) facts related to certain other\nlocations owned or formerly owned by us. In accordance with approved and proposed remediation action plans, we expect that the implementation and ongoing\nmonitoring could occur over a period of 30 or more years.\nAs additional facts are developed, feasibility studies are completed, remediation plans are modified, necessary regulatory approvals for the\nimplementation of remediation are obtained, alternative technologies are developed and/or other factors change, there may be revisions to management’s\nestimates, and actual costs may exceed the current environmental accruals. We believe at this time that it is reasonably possible that undiscounted costs\nassociated with these environmental matters may exceed current accruals by amounts that could be, in the aggregate, up to an estimated $11.9 million over the\nremediation period. It is reasonably possible that our recorded estimate will change in the next 12 months.\nOther Contingencies. We are party to various lawsuits, claims, investigations and administrative proceedings that arise in connection with past and\ncurrent operations. We evaluate such matters on a case-by-case basis and our policy is to vigorously contest any such claims we believe are without merit. We\naccrue for a legal liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Quarterly, in addition to\nwhen changes in facts and circumstances require it, we review and adjust these accruals to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of\nlegal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. While uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of such matters and it is\npresently impossible to determine the actual cost that may ultimately be incurred, we believe that we have sufficiently accrued for such matters and that the\nultimate resolution of pending matters will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, operating results or liquidity.\n17\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\n8.

As of September 30, 2024, we received net cash proceeds of $13.4 million.\nSupply Chain Financing. We are party to several supply chain financing arrangements, in which we may sell certain of our customers’ trade accounts\nreceivable to such customers’ financial institutions without recourse. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold trade accounts\nreceivable totaling $260.5 million and $792.9 million, respectively, related to these supply chain financing arrangements, of which our customers’ financial\ninstitutions applied discount fees totaling $6.1 million and $18.9 million, respectively. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold\ntrade accounts receivable totaling $315.9 million and $942.5 million, respectively, related to these supply chain financing arrangements, of which our customers’\nfinancial institutions applied discount fees totaling $7.6 million and $22.8 million, respectively. To the extent discount fees related to the sale of trade accounts\nreceivable under supply chain financing arrangements are not reimbursed by our customers, they are included in Other income (expense), net. As of September\n30, 2024, we had been and/or expected to be substantially reimbursed by our customers for these discount fees, in accordance with the underlying sales\nagreements.\n10. Income Tax Matters\nThe following table presents the income tax provision by region (in millions of dollars):\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDomestic $ (2.8) $ 0.1 $ (10.1) $ (6.9)\nForeign (0.6) (0.2) (1.6) (1.1)\nTotal $ (3.4) $ (0.1) $ (11.7) $ (8.0)\nThe income tax provision for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $3.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively, reflecting\nan effective tax rate of 22% and 2%, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of 8% related to Federal research and development credits, partially offset by: (i) an increase of 4% related\nto non-deductible compensation expense; (ii) an increase of 1% related to foreign withholding tax; and (iii) an increase of 1% related to other permanent items.\nThe difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a\ndecrease of 30% related to Federal research and development credits, partially offset by: (i) an increase of 4% for return to provision differences and (ii) an\nincrease of 3% related to non-deductible compensation expense.\nThe income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $11.7 million and $8.0 million, respectively, reflecting an\neffective tax rate of 23% and 17%, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease of 5% related to Federal research and development credits, offset by: (i) an increase of 3% related to\nnon-deductible compensation expense; (ii) an increase of 1% related to foreign withholding tax; and (iii) an increase of 1% related to other permanent items. The\ndifference between the effective tax rate and the projected blended statutory tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to: (i) a\ndecrease of 9% related to Federal research and development tax credits and (ii) a decrease of 2% for return to provision differences, partially offset by: (i) an\nincrease of 2% related to non-deductible compensation expense and (ii) an increase of 1% related to foreign withholding tax.\n19\nNotes Index\nKAISER ALUMINUM CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES\nNOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – UNAUDITED\nOur gross unrecognized benefits relating to uncertain tax positions were $7.2 million and $6.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively, of which, $7.2 million and $6.5 million would be recorded through our income tax provision and thus, impact the effective tax rate at September\n30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, if the gross unrecognized tax benefits were to be recognized.\nWe do not expect our gross unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change within the next 12 months.\n11. Earnings Per Share\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing distributed and undistributed net income allocable to common shares by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during the applicable period. The basic weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period\nexcludes non-vested share-based payment awards. Basic and diluted net income per share was calculated under the two-class method for the quarter and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and the treasury method for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, based on the more dilutive method for\neach period.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share (in millions of dollars, except share and per share amounts):\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet income available to common shareholders1 $ 12.0 $ 5.4 $ 39.7 $ 39.6\nDenominator – Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in\nthousands):\nBasic 16,087 15,995 16,062 15,970\nAdd: dilutive effect of non-vested common shares, restricted stock units\nand performance shares2 248 159 229 140\nDiluted 16,335 16,154 16,291 16,110\nNet income per common share, Basic: $ 0.75 $ 0.34 $ 2.47 $ 2.48\nNet income per common share, Diluted: $ 0.74 $ 0.34 $ 2.44 $ 2.46\n1. Represents Net income less distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to non-vested restricted stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to\ndividends.\n2. Quantities in the following discussion are denoted in whole shares. During the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 120\nand 700 shares, respectively, were excluded from the weighted-average diluted shares computation as their inclusion would have been anti‑dilutive. For\nthe quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 4,800 and 14,000 shares, respectively, were excluded from the weighted-average\ndiluted shares computation as their inclusion would have been anti‑dilutive.\n12.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements appear throughout this Report and can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as\n“believes,” “expects,” “may,” “estimates,” “will,” “should,” “plans” or “anticipates,” or the negative of the foregoing or other variations of comparable\nterminology, or by discussions of strategy. Readers are cautioned that any such forward‑looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and\ninvolve significant risks and uncertainties and that actual results may vary from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These\nfactors include: (i) the effectiveness of management’s strategies and decisions, including strategic investments, capital spending strategies, cost reduction\ninitiatives, sourcing strategies, processes and countermeasures implemented to address operational and supply chain challenges and the execution of those\nstrategies; (ii) the execution and timing of strategic investments; (iii) general economic and business conditions, including the impact of geopolitical factors and\ngovernmental and other actions taken in response, cyclicality, reshoring, labor challenges, supply interruptions, customer disruptions, customer inventory\nimbalances and supply chain issues, and other conditions that impact demand drivers in the Aero/HS Products, Packaging, GE Products, Automotive Extrusions\nand other end markets we serve; (iv) our ability to participate in mature and anticipated new automotive programs expected to launch in the future and\nsuccessfully launch new automotive programs; (v) changes or shifts in defense spending due to competing national priorities; (vi) pricing, market conditions and\nour ability to effectively execute commercial and labor strategies, pass through cost increases, including the institution of surcharges, and flex costs in response\nto inflation, volatile commodity costs and changing economic conditions; (vii) developments in technology; (viii) the impact of our future earnings, cash flows,\nfinancial condition, capital requirements and other factors on our financial strength and flexibility; (ix) new or modified statutory or regulatory requirements;\n(x) the successful integration of acquired operations and technologies and (xi) stakeholders’, including regulators’ and customers’, views regarding our\nsustainability goals and initiatives and the impact of factors outside of our control on such goals and initiatives. This Item and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors”\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, each identify other factors that could cause actual results to vary. No\nassurance can be given that these are all of the factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from the forward looking statements.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Part I, Item 1. “Financial\nStatements” of this Report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary\nData” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis information contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s\nfinancial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance\nwith GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the company. We have provided a reconciliation of non‑GAAP financial\nmeasures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables. We have also provided discussion of the reasons we believe that\npresentation of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors, as well as any additional ways in which we use the non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures used in the following discussions are Conversion Revenue (defined as Net sales less the Hedged Cost of\nAlloyed Metal, see below in “Metal Pricing Policies” discussion), Adjusted EBITDA and ratios related thereto. These measures are presented because\nmanagement uses this information to monitor and evaluate financial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors.\nIn the discussion of operating results below, we refer to certain items as “non-run-rate items.” For purposes of such discussion, non-run-rate items are\nitems that, while they may recur from period-to-period: (i) are particularly material to results; (ii) affect costs primarily as a result of external market factors; and\n(iii) may not recur in future periods if the same level of underlying performance were to occur. Non-run-rate items are part of our business and operating\nenvironment but are worthy of being highlighted for the benefit of readers of our financial statements. Our intent is to allow users of the financial statements to\nconsider our results both in light of and separately from such items. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income, see below in “Results of\nOperations - Selected Operational and Financial Information.” Reconciliations of certain forward‑looking non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP\nmeasures are not provided because certain items required for such reconciliations are outside of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted or provided\nwithout unreasonable effort.\nMetal Pricing Policies\nA fundamental part of our business model is to remain neutral to the impact from fluctuations in the market price for aluminum and certain alloys,\nthereby earning profit predominantly from the conversion of aluminum into semi-fabricated mill products. We refer to this as “metal price neutrality.” We\npurchase primary, rolling ingot and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our main raw material, and\n22\nalloys at prices that fluctuate on a monthly basis, and our pricing policies generally allow us to pass the underlying index cost of aluminum and certain alloys\nthrough to our customers so that we remain neutral to metal pricing. However, for some of our higher margin products sold on a spot basis, competitive\ndynamics may limit the amount and/or delay the timing of selling price increases to recover our increased aluminum and alloy costs, resulting in a lag up to\nseveral months during which we may be exposed to metal price risk. As a result, we can experience an adverse impact when aluminum and alloy prices increase,\nand a favorable impact to us when aluminum and alloy prices decline, as we and our competitors tend to defer adjusting pricing unless required by market\ndynamics in a declining metal cost environment. Similarly, we typically purchase scrap at a discount to the index price of aluminum which can vary depending\non market dynamics and availability. As a result, we can experience an adverse impact when scrap discounts decrease and a favorable impact when scrap\ndiscounts increase. We may also enter into firm-price customer sales agreements that specify a firm underlying metal price plus a conversion price. Spot sales\nwith lagged aluminum and alloy price pass through and firm-price sales agreements create price exposure for us, which we mitigate through hedging and related\nprograms with an objective to remain metal price neutral. Additionally, we have certain contracts that may adjust certain alloy prices for a forward period based\non an average prior period cost for such alloys. As a result, until the selling price resets, we can experience an adverse impact when alloy prices increase and a\nfavorable impact when alloy prices decrease.\nOur pricing policies and hedging program are intended to significantly reduce or eliminate the impact on our profitability of fluctuations in the\nunderlying price of primary, rolling ingot and scrap, or recycled, aluminum, our main raw material, and certain alloys so that our earnings are predominantly\nassociated with the conversion of aluminum to semi‑fabricated mill products. To allow users of our financial statements to consider the impact of aluminum and\nalloy cost on our Net sales, we disclose Net sales as well as Conversion Revenue, which is Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal. As used in this\ndiscussion, “Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal” is the cost of aluminum at the average MWTP plus the cost of alloying elements and any realized gains and/or\nlosses on settled hedges related to the metal sold in the referenced period. The average MWTP of aluminum reflects the primary aluminum supply/demand\ndynamics in North America. For a reconciliation of Conversion Revenue to Net sales, see below in “Results of Operations - Selected Operational and Financial\nInformation.”\nBusiness Overview\nWe manufacture and sell semi-fabricated specialty aluminum mill products for the following end market applications: (i) Aero/HS Products; (ii)\nPackaging; (iii) GE Products; (iv) Automotive Extrusions; and (v) Other products. Our fabricated aluminum mill products include flat-rolled (plate, sheet and\ncoil), extruded (rod, bar, hollows and shapes), drawn (rod, bar, pipe, tube and wire) and certain cast aluminum products. The sophistication of our products is\ndue to the metallurgy and physical properties of the metal and the special characteristics that are required for particular end uses. We strategically choose to\nserve technically challenging applications for which we can deploy our core metallurgical and process technology capabilities to produce highly engineered mill\nproducts with differentiated characteristics that present opportunities for us to receive premium pricing and to create long-term profitable growth.\nWith respect to the global market for flat-rolled aluminum mill products, our focus is on heat treat plate and sheet for applications that require higher\nstrength and other desired product attributes that cannot be achieved by common alloy rolled products. The primary end market applications of flat-rolled heat\ntreat plate and sheet, which are produced at Trentwood, are Aero/HS Products (which we sell globally) and GE Products (which we predominantly sell within\nNorth America). The primary end market application of bare and coated aluminum coil, which are produced at Warrick, is Packaging (which we sell in North\nAmerica). Our Packaging products require demanding attributes and can be further processed to include coating and slitting depending on customer\nspecifications.\nIn the areas of aluminum extrusions, we focus on demanding Aero/HS Products, GE Products, and Automotive Extrusions that require high strength,\nmachinability or other specific properties where we can create and maintain a defensible competitive position because of our technical expertise, strong\nproduction capability and high product quality. Our 10 active extrusion/drawing facilities, nine of which are in the United States and one of which is in Canada,\nserve primarily North American demand for aerospace, general engineering, or automotive applications. Additionally, we have a facility in Columbia, New\nJersey, that focuses on multi-material advanced manufacturing methods and techniques, which include multi-axis computer numerical control machining,\nadditive manufacturing (“3D Printing”), welding and fabrication for demanding aerospace and defense, high technology, general industrial, and automotive\napplications. Our consolidated Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2,258.6 million on approximately 880.0 million pounds shipped\nfrom our facilities. We employed approximately 4,000 people at September 30, 2024.\nWe have long-standing relationships with our customers, which consist primarily of blue-chip companies including leading aerospace and automotive\nmanufacturers, tier one aerospace and automotive suppliers, food and beverage packaging manufacturers, and metal service centers. Approximately 75% of our\nshipments is sold direct to manufacturers or tier one suppliers and approximately 25% is sold to metal service centers. In our served markets, we seek to be the\nsupplier of choice by pursuing “Best in Class” customer satisfaction driven by quality, availability, service and delivery performance. We believe we differentiate\nour product portfolio through our broad product offering and our (cid:0).(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)U Select® products, which are engineered and manufactured to deliver enhanced product\n23\ncharacteristics with improved consistency, so as to result in better performance, lower waste and, in many cases, lower production cost for our customers.\nHighlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024:\n• Net sales $747.7 million; Conversion Revenue $362.0 million;\n• Net income $12.0 million; Net income per diluted share $0.74; and\n• Cash dividends and dividend equivalents of $0.77 per share or $12.7 million paid during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nNet Sales. Net sales totaled $747.7 million and $743.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively,\nreflecting a 7.1 million pound (2%) decrease in shipment volume and an $0.08/lb (3%) increase in average realized sales price per pound. The shipment volume\ndecrease reflected: (i) a 4.7 million pound (7%) decrease in Aero/HS Products; (ii) a 3.5 million pound (2%) decrease in Packaging; (iii) a 1.1 million pound\n(52%) decrease in Other products; and (iv) a 0.4 million pound (2%) decrease in Automotive Extrusions, partially offset by a 2.6 million pound (5%) increase in\nGE Products. The average realized sales price per pound reflected a $0.03/lb (2%) increase in the average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal price per pound and a\n$0.05/lb (4%) increase in Conversion Revenue per pound reflecting higher pricing and improved mix. For further details, see the table below in “Selected\nOperational and Financial Information.”\nNet sales totaled $2,258.6 million and $2,365.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, reflecting a\n32.7 million pound (4%) decrease in shipment volume and a $0.02/lb (1%) decrease in average realized sales price per pound. The shipment volume decrease\nreflected: (i) a 32.2 million pound (7%) decrease in Packaging; (ii) a 4.5 million pound (58%) decrease in Other products; (iii) a 1.7 million pound (1%) decrease\nin Aero/HS Products; and (iv) a 1.3 million pound (2%) decrease in Automotive Extrusions, partially offset by a 7.0 million pound (4%) increase in GE\nProducts. The average realized sales price per pound reflected a $0.06/lb (4%) decrease in the average Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal price per pound and a\n$0.04/lb (3%) increase in Conversion Revenue per pound reflecting higher pricing and improved mix. For further details, see the table below in “Selected\nOperational and Financial Information.”\nCOGS. COGS for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $671.8 million, or 90% of Net sales, compared to $665.2 million, or 89% of Net sales,\nfor the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $6.6 million reflected a $0.7 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, more than offset by a\n$7.3 million increase in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Of the $0.7 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, $9.2 million was due to\nlower shipment volume, partially offset by an $8.5 million increase in hedged metal prices (see above in our “Net Sales” discussion for further details). The $7.3\nmillion increase in net manufacturing conversion and other costs primarily reflected: (i) a $3.3 million increase in legacy environmental costs; (ii) a $2.5 million\nnet increase in costs primarily driven by product mix and higher energy costs; and (iii) a $1.5 million net increase in manufacturing costs, primarily attributable\nto a $1.8 million increase in LIFO reserve expense. For a further discussion of the comparative results of operations for the quarters ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023, see below in “Selected Operational and Financial Information.”\nCOGS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled $2,005.2 million or 89% of Net sales, compared to $2,114.7 million, or 89% of Net sales,\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of $109.5 million reflected a $99.6 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal and a $10.0\nmillion decrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs. Of the $99.6 million decrease in Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal, $54.3 million was due to\nlower hedged metal prices and $45.3 million was due to lower shipment volume (see above in our “Net Sales” discussion for further details). The $10.0 million\ndecrease in net manufacturing conversion and other costs primarily reflected: (i) a $17.8 million decrease in costs associated with a reduction in pounds shipped;\n(ii) a $4.9 million decrease in major maintenance costs driven by timing of annual planned maintenance programs, partially offset by: (i) a $6.4 million net\nincrease in manufacturing costs, primarily attributable to an $10.3 million increase in LIFO reserve expense, partially offset by improved metal sourcing; (ii) a\n$3.2 million increase in legacy environmental costs; and (iii) a $3.1 million increase in energy costs. For a further discussion of the comparative results of\noperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, see below in “Selected Operational and Financial Information.”\nSelling, General, Administrative, Research and Development (“SG&A and R&D”). SG&A and R&D expense totaled $28.8 million and $30.5 million for\nthe quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, and $93.0 million and $92.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to: (i) a $1.3 million decrease in legal\nfees and (ii) a $1.0 million decrease in consulting and\n24\noutsourced services, partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in salaries, benefits and incentive compensation. The increase for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 compared with September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a $3.2 million increase in salaries, benefits, and incentive compensation, partially\noffset by: (i) a $1.8 million decrease in legal fees; (ii) a $0.4 million decrease in consulting and outsourced services; and (iii) a $0.3 million decrease in other\nSG&A and R&D expenses.\nRestructuring Costs. Restructuring costs of $0.7 million and $1.6 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023,\nrespectively, and $7.6 million and $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, related to our restructuring\nplans initiated in 2022 and 2024. See Note 4 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further information regarding the\nrestructuring plans.\nOther Operating Charges, Net.

See Note 10 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for disclosure regarding our income tax\nprovision.\nSelected Operational and Financial Information\nThe following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1. “Financial\nStatements” of this Report. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of those for a full year.\nThe table below provides selected operational and financial information (in millions of dollars):\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet income $ 12.0 $ 5.4 $ 39.7 $ 39.6\nInterest expense 10.7 11.4 33.3 35.4\nOther income, net (8.7) 2.2 (19.1) (8.9)\nIncome tax provision 3.4 0.1 11.7 8.0\nDepreciation and amortization 29.0 27.2 86.8 79.9\nNon-run-rate items:\nRestructuring costs 0.7 1.6 7.6 4.2\nMark-to-market (gain) loss on derivative instruments1 — (0.3) 2.2 (0.2)\nNon-cash asset impairment charge — — 0.4 —\nEnvironmental expenses2 3.3 — 3.7 —\nTotal non-run-rate items 4.0 1.3 13.9 4.0\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 50.4 $ 47.6 $ 166.3 $ 158.0\n1. Mark-to-market (gain) loss on derivative instruments represents the (gain) loss on non-designated commodity hedges. Adjusted EBITDA reflects the\nrealized impact related to these derivatives upon settlement.\n2. Non-run-rate environmental expenses are related to legacy contingencies from activities at operating facilities prior to July 6, 2006. See Note 7 of Notes\nto Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for additional information relating to the environmental expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $2.8 million higher than Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended September 30, 2023,\nprimarily driven by improved pricing and product mix. This was offset by: (i) an increase in LIFO reserve expense and (ii) an increase in energy costs. See\nabove in “Consolidated Results of Operations” for further details.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $8.3 million higher than Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September\n30, 2023, primarily driven by improved pricing and product mix and lower major maintenance costs driven by timing of annual planned maintenance programs.\nThis was offset by: (i) an increase in LIFO reserve expense, partially offset by improved metal sourcing and (ii) an increase in energy costs. See above in\n“Consolidated Results of Operations” for further details.\n25\nThe following table provides our shipment and Conversion Revenue information (in millions of dollars, except shipments and Conversion Revenue per\npound) by end market applications:\nQuarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAero/HS Products:\nShipments (mmlbs) 59.5 64.2 184.6 186.3\n$ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb\nNet sales $ 213.1 $ 3.58 $ 223.3 $ 3.48 $ 659.7 $ 3.57 $ 662.4 $ 3.56\nLess: Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal (85.2) (1.43) (89.0) (1.39) (261.9) (1.42) (275.2) (1.48)\nConversion Revenue $ 127.9 $ 2.15 $ 134.3 $ 2.09 $ 397.8 $ 2.15 $ 387.2 $ 2.08\nPackaging:\nShipments (mmlbs) 150.9 154.4 439.2 471.4\n$ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb\nNet sales $ 319.5 $ 2.12 $ 312.2 $ 2.02 $ 930.0 $ 2.12 $ 1,021.1 $ 2.17\nLess: Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal (191.1) (1.27) (194.2) (1.26) (564.7) (1.29) (636.2) (1.35)\nConversion Revenue $ 128.4 $ 0.85 $ 118.0 $ 0.76 $ 365.3 $ 0.83 $ 384.9 $ 0.82\nGE Products:\nShipments (mmlbs) 55.6 53.0 173.2 166.2\n$ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb\nNet sales $ 150.7 $ 2.71 $ 143.6 $ 2.71 $ 466.3 $ 2.69 $ 465.1 $ 2.80\nLess: Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal (74.6) (1.34) (68.5) (1.29) (227.4) (1.31) (228.9) (1.38)\nConversion Revenue $ 76.1 $ 1.37 $ 75.1 $ 1.42 $ 238.9 $ 1.38 $ 236.2 $ 1.42\nAutomotive Extrusions:\nShipments (mmlbs) 25.2 25.6 79.8 81.1\n$ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb\nNet sales $ 62.1 $ 2.45 $ 60.1 $ 2.35 $ 195.3 $ 2.45 $ 199.3 $ 2.46\nLess: Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal (33.4) (1.31) (32.2) (1.26) (102.5) (1.29) (109.8) (1.36)\nConversion Revenue $ 28.7 $ 1.14 $ 27.9 $ 1.09 $ 92.8 $ 1.16 $ 89.5 $ 1.10\nOther Products:\nShipments (mmlbs) 1.0 2.1 3.2 7.7\n$ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb\nNet sales $ 2.3 $ 2.30 $ 4.4 $ 2.10 $ 7.3 $ 2.28 $ 17.4 $ 2.26\nLess: Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal (1.4) (1.40) (2.6) (1.24) (4.3) (1.34) (10.3) (1.34)\nConversion Revenue $ 0.9 $ 0.90 $ 1.8 $ 0.86 $ 3.0 $ 0.94 $ 7.1 $ 0.92\nTotal:\nShipments (mmlbs) 292.2 299.3 880.0 912.7\n$ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb $ $ / lb\nNet sales $ 747.7 $ 2.56 $ 743.6 $ 2.48 $ 2,258.6 $ 2.57 $ 2,365.3 $ 2.59\nLess: Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal1 (385.7) (1.32) (386.5) (1.29) (1,160.8) (1.32) (1,260.4) (1.38)\nConversion Revenue $ 362.0 $ 1.24 $ 357.1 $ 1.19 $ 1,097.8 $ 1.25 $ 1,104.9 $ 1.21\n1. Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included $383.6 million and $380.0 million,\nrespectively, reflecting the cost of aluminum at the average MWTP and the cost of certain alloys used in the production process, as well as metal price\nexposure on shipments that we hedged with realized losses upon settlement of $2.1 million and $6.5 million in the quarters ended September 30, 2024\nand September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which were included within both Net sales and COGS in our Statements of Consolidated Income. Hedged\nCost of Alloyed Metal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 included $1,158.6 million and $1,245.6 million,\nrespectively, reflecting the cost of aluminum at the average MWTP and the cost of certain alloys used in the production process, as well as metal price\nexposure on shipments that we hedged with realized losses upon settlement of $2.2 million and $14.8 million in the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, all of which were included within both Net sales and COGS in our Statements of Consolidated Income. See\nNote 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for the total realized loss on aluminum hedges for which we hedged the\nmetal price exposure externally.\n26\n\nOutlook\nWe expect demand to be consistent with our previous expectations for the balance of 2024. In the Aero/HS Products end market, we remain cautious on\nour near-term outlook due to the timing of certain customer commercial and labor negotiations which may have a short-term impact on demand and shipments.\nIn the Packaging end market, industry momentum and performance improvements are expected to continue as Warrick nears the completion of its fourth coating\nline investment, which will drive margin improvement starting in 2025. In the GE Products end market, destocking within our long products has concluded, and\nshipment levels are now in better alignment with end market demand. In the Automotive Extrusions end market, we maintain a positive outlook as production\nfor light and heavy truck sport utility vehicle platforms has outpaced broader automotive production rates.\nAccordingly, for the full year 2024, we expect overall conversion revenue to remain stable with growth up to 1% compared to 2023. Adjusted EBITDA\nmargins, less the full year impact from LIFO valuation charges, are expected to improve 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2023 as we continue to implement\ncost reduction measures in our operations, increase manufacturing efficiencies, and execute our strategic growth initiatives.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSummary\nThe following table summarizes our liquidity (in millions of dollars):\nAs of September 30, 2024 As of December 31, 2023\nAvailable cash and cash equivalents $ 45.7 $ 82.4\nBorrowing availability under Revolving Credit Facility, net of letters of credit1 549.2 516.7\nTotal liquidity $ 594.9 $ 599.1\n1. Borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was determined by a borrowing base calculated as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nWe place our cash in bank deposits with high credit quality financial institutions. See Note 12 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Report for information regarding restricted cash at September 30, 2024.\nWe had no outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 under our Revolving Credit Facility. See below in “Sources of\nLiquidity” for a further discussion of subsequent borrowing activity. See Note 6 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in millions of dollars):\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 123.7 $ 137.6\nInvesting activities $ (118.6) $ (105.0)\nFinancing activities $ (41.8) $ (41.2)\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected results of business activity described above in our\n“Consolidated Results of Operations” discussion, as well as the following working capital changes: (i) an increase in trade and other receivables, net of $33.7\nmillion primarily due to increased metal prices and sales mix; (ii) an increase in accounts payable of $17.5 million primarily due to the timing of payments and\nhigher metal cost; (iii) an increase in inventory of $8.7 million, excluding LIFO impact, primarily due to strong customer demand in Packaging end market; and\n(iv) a net decrease in other accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.5 million due to timing and a decrease in general business\nactivities.\nCash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected results of business activity described above in our\n“Consolidated Results of Operations” discussion, as well as the following working capital changes: (i) a decrease in accounts payable of $53.9 million primarily\ndue to a decrease in metal purchases and timing of payments; (ii) a decrease in inventory of $38.3 million, excluding LIFO impact, due to improved inventory\nmanagement since beginning of the year; and (iii) a decrease in trade and other receivables of $11.7 million primarily due to lower shipments and a decrease in\nmetal costs during this period.\n27\nSee Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows included in this Report for further details on our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing\nactivities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nSources of Liquidity\nOur most significant sources of liquidity include available cash and cash equivalents, borrowing availability under the Revolving Credit Facility, and\nfunds generated from operations. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and meet our short-term and long-term obligations.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Notes have covenants that, we believe, allow us to operate our business with limited restrictions and significant\nflexibility for the foreseeable future. We do not believe that the covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility are reasonably likely to limit our ability to\nraise additional debt or equity should we choose to do so during the next 12 months, nor do we believe it is likely that during the next 12 months we will trigger\nthe availability threshold that would require measuring and maintaining a fixed charge coverage ratio.\nAt October 21, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for a description of our Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe engage in certain customer-based supply chain financing programs to accelerate the receipt of payment for outstanding accounts receivable from\ncertain customers. Costs of these programs are typically reimbursed to us by the customer. Receivables transferred under these customer-based supply chain\nfinancing programs generally meet the requirements to be accounted for as sales resulting in the derecognition of such receivables from our consolidated balance\nsheets. Receivables involved with these customer‑based supply chain finance programs for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 constituted approximately\n36% of our Net sales. See Note 9 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for further details with respect to these supply\nchain financing programs.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nSee Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for mandatory principal and cash interest payments on the outstanding borrowings.\nWe do not believe that covenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes are reasonably likely to limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity\nfinancing should we choose to do so during the next 12 months.\nExcept as otherwise disclosed in this Report, there has been no material change in our material cash requirements from significant contractual\nobligations, commercial commitments, or off-balance sheet arrangements other than in the ordinary course of business since December 31, 2023.\nCapital Expenditures and Investments\nWe strive to strengthen our competitive position across our end markets through strategic capital investment. Significant investments over the past decade\nhave positioned us well with increased capacity and expanded manufacturing capabilities while more recent capital projects have focused on further enhancing\nmanufacturing cost efficiency, improving product quality and promoting operational security, which we believe are critical to maintaining and strengthening our\nposition in an increasingly competitive market environment. A significant portion of our capital spending over the past several years related to the modernization\nproject at Trentwood, which focused on equipment upgrades throughout the process flow to reduce conversion costs, increase efficiency, and further improve our\ncompetitive cost position on all products produced at Trentwood. In addition, a significant portion of the investment also focused on modernizing legacy\nequipment and the process flow for thin gauge plate to achieve (cid:0).(cid:0)D(cid:0)L(cid:0)V(cid:0)H(cid:0)U Select® quality enhancements for these Aero/HS Products and GE Products. These\nimprovements have allowed us to gain incremental manufacturing capacity to enable future sales growth. We continue spending on our previously announced\ncapital project to add a fourth coating line at Warrick to increase our capacity for higher margin coated packaging product.\nOur capital investment plans remain focused on supporting demand growth through capacity expansion, sustaining our operations, enhancing product\nquality and increasing operating efficiencies. We anticipate total capital spending in 2024 of approximately $180.0 million to $190.0 million, the majority of\nwhich will be focused on growth initiatives, primarily reflecting investment in the fourth\n28\ncoating line at Warrick. We expect to continue to deploy capital thoughtfully so that investment decisions align with demand expectations in order to maximize\nthe earnings potential of the business and maintain financial strength and flexibility.\nCapital investments will be funded using cash generated from operations, available cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under the Revolving Credit\nFacility and/or other third-party financing arrangements. The level of anticipated capital expenditures may be adjusted from time to time depending on our\nbusiness plans, our price outlook for fabricated aluminum products, our ability to maintain adequate liquidity, and other factors. No assurance can be provided as\nto the timing of any such expenditures or the operational benefits expected therefrom.\nDividends\nWe have consistently paid a quarterly cash dividend since the second quarter of 2007 to holders of our common stock, including holders of restricted\nstock. Nevertheless, as in the past, the future declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on\na number of factors, including our financial and operating results, including the availability of surplus and/or net profits, liquidity position, anticipated cash\nrequirements and contractual restrictions under our Revolving Credit Facility, the indentures for our Senior Notes or other indebtedness we may incur in the\nfuture. We can give no assurance that dividends will be declared and paid in the future.\nWe also pay quarterly dividend equivalents to the holders of certain restricted stock units. Holders of performance shares are not paid a quarterly\ndividend equivalent, but instead are entitled to receive, in connection with the issuance of underlying shares of common stock for performance shares that\nultimately vest, a one-time payment equal to the dividends such holders would have received if the number of such shares of common stock so issued had been\nheld of record by such holders from the date of grant of such performance shares through the date of such issuance.\nSee our Statements of Consolidated Stockholders’ Equity and Note 14 of Notes to Interim Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report for\ninformation regarding dividends paid during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and declared subsequent to September 30, 2024.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nWe suspended share repurchases as of March 2020. We will continue to assess share repurchases as a part of our capital allocation priorities and strategic\ninvestment opportunities identified to support further growth in our business. At September 30, 2024, $93.1 million remained authorized and available for future\nrepurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program.\nSee our Statements of Consolidated Stockholders’ Equity included in this Report for information regarding minimum statutory tax withholding\nobligations arising during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 in connection with the vesting of non‑vested shares, restricted stock\nunits, and performance shares.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are\nrequired to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses\nand the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management\nbelieves to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies,\nassumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events\nand their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023. We discuss our critical accounting estimates in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material changes in our\ncritical accounting estimates and policies since December 31, 2023.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\n29\nAvailability of Information\nWe file Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements, any amendments to those\nreports and statements and other information with the SEC. You may obtain the documents that we file electronically from the SEC’s website at\nhttp://www.sec.gov. Our filings with the SEC are made available free of charge on our website at http://www.kaiseraluminum.com as soon as reasonably\npracticable after we file or furnish the materials with the SEC. News releases, announcements of upcoming earnings calls and events in which our management\nparticipates or hosts with members of the investment community and an archive of webcasts of such earnings calls and investor events and related investor\npresentations, are also available on our website. Information on our website is not incorporated into this Form 10-Q unless expressly noted.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe following quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk should be read in conjunction with Note 5 and Note 8 of Notes to Interim\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. Our operating results are sensitive to changes in the prices of primary aluminum, certain alloying\nmetals, natural gas, electricity, and foreign currency, and also depend to a significant degree upon the volume and mix of products sold to customers. We have\nhistorically utilized hedging transactions to lock in a specified price or range of prices for certain products which we sell or consume in our production process,\nand to mitigate our exposure to changes in energy prices.\nAluminum\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, settlements of derivative contracts were for 117.3 million pounds and 149.7\nmillion pounds, respectively, of hedged shipments sold on pricing terms that created aluminum price risk for us. At September 30, 2024, we had derivative\ncontracts with respect to approximately 31.1 million, 20.5 million and 0.2 million pounds to hedge sales to be made in the remainder of 2024, 2025 and 2026,\nrespectively, on pricing terms that create aluminum price risk for us.\nBased on the aluminum derivative positions held by us to hedge firm-price customer sales agreements, we estimate that a $0.10/lb decrease in the LME\nmarket price of aluminum as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in an unrealized mark-\nto-market loss of $5.2 million and $6.3 million, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our aluminum derivative positions.\nAdditionally, we estimate that a $0.05/lb decrease in the Midwest premium for aluminum as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with all other\nvariables held constant, would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $2.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, with corresponding changes to\nthe net fair value of our aluminum derivative positions.\nAlloying Metals\nWe are exposed to the risk of fluctuating prices of certain alloying metals, especially copper, zinc, and magnesium, to the extent that changes in their\nprices do not highly correlate with price changes for aluminum. Copper, zinc, magnesium, and certain other metals are used in our remelt operations to cast\nrolling ingot and extrusion billet with the proper chemistry for our products. From time to time, we enter into forward contract swaps and/or physical delivery\ncommitments with third parties to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in the prices of these alloys. As of September 30, 2024, we had forward swap contracts\nwith settlement dates designed to align with the timing of scheduled purchases of zinc and copper by our manufacturing facilities. We estimate that a $0.10/lb\ndecrease in the market price of zinc and copper as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, with all other variables held constant, would have resulted in\nan unrealized mark‑to‑market loss of $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our zinc and copper\nderivative positions.\nEnergy\nWe are exposed to the risk of fluctuating prices for natural gas and electricity. We, from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, enter into\nhedging transactions and/or firm-price physical delivery commitments with third parties to mitigate our risk from fluctuations in natural gas and electricity\nprices. We estimate that a $1.00 per mmbtu decrease in natural gas prices would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $3.1 million and $3.4\nmillion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our natural gas derivative positions.\nWe estimate that a $5.00 per Mwh decrease in electricity prices would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $0.1 million and $0.3 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our electricity derivative positions.\n30\nForeign Currency\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have hedged the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to certain lease transactions and equipment purchases\ndenominated in Euros and British Pounds using forward swap contracts with settlement dates through July 2027. We estimate that a 10% decrease in the\nexchange rate of our hedged foreign currencies to U.S. dollars would have resulted in an unrealized mark-to-market loss of $1.2 million and $1.9 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, with corresponding changes to the net fair value of our foreign currency derivative positions.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required\nto be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in\nthe SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management\nrecognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control\nobjectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. An evaluation of the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures was performed as of the end of the period covered by this Report under the\nsupervision of and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on that evaluation,\nour principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 at\nthe reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. We had no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n31\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nReference is made to Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for\ninformation concerning material legal proceedings with respect to the Company.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\nThe following table provides information regarding our repurchases of our common shares during the quarter ended September 30, 2024:\nEquity Incentive Plan Stock Repurchase Plan\nMaximum\nDollar Value\nof Shares\nthat May\nYet Be\nTotal Total Purchased\nNumber Average Number Average Under the\nof Shares Price of Shares Price Programs\nPurchased1 per Share Purchased2 per Share (millions)2\nJuly 1, 2024 - July 31, 2024 — $ — — $ — $ 93.1\nAugust 1, 2024 - August 31, 2024 357 70.82 — — 93.1\nSeptember 1, 2024 - September 30, 2024 — — — — 93.1\nTotal 357 $ 70.82 — $ — n/a\n1. Under our equity incentive plan, participants may elect to have us withhold common shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations\narising from the recognition of income and the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance shares. When we withhold these shares,\nwe are required to remit to the appropriate taxing authorities the market price of the shares withheld by us on the date of withholding. The withholding of\ncommon shares by us could be deemed a purchase of such common shares.\n2. In September 2018, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock at an aggregate market\nvalue of up to $100.0 million. At September 30, 2024, $93.1 million remained available to repurchase our common shares pursuant to the stock\nrepurchase program. The September 2018 authorization does not have an expiration date.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nItem 5.

All Borrowing requests which are not made on-\nline via Agent’s electronic platform or portal shall be subject to (and unless Agent elects otherwise in the exercise of its sole discretion, such\nBorrowings shall not be made until the completion of) Agent’s authentication process (with results satisfactory to Agent) prior to the funding of\nany such requested Revolving Loan.\n(b) Making of Swing Loans. In the case of a Revolving Loan and so long as any of (i) the aggregate amount of\nSwing Loans made since the last Settlement Date, minus all payments or other amounts applied to Swing Loans since the last Settlement Date,\nplus the amount of the requested Swing Loan does not exceed the greater of 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount and $57,500,000, or (ii)\nSwing Lender, in its sole discretion, agrees to make a Swing Loan notwithstanding the foregoing limitation, Swing Lender shall make a\nRevolving Loan (any such Revolving Loan made by Swing Lender pursuant to this Section 2.3(b) being referred to as a “Swing Loan” and all\nsuch Revolving Loans being referred to as “Swing Loans”) available to Borrowers on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring\nimmediately available funds in the amount of such Borrowing to the Designated Account. Each Swing Loan shall be deemed to be a Revolving\nLoan hereunder and shall be subject to all the terms and conditions (including Section 3) applicable to other Revolving Loans, except that all\npayments (including interest) on any Swing Loan shall be payable to Swing Lender solely for its own account. Subject to the provisions of\nSection 2.3(d)(ii), Swing Lender shall not make and shall not be obligated to make any Swing Loan if Swing Lender has actual knowledge that\n(i) one or more of the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the\napplicable Borrowing, or (ii) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such Funding Date. Swing Lender shall not otherwise\nbe required to determine whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 have been satisfied on the Funding Date applicable\nthereto prior to making any Swing Loan. The Swing Loans shall be secured by Agent’s Liens, constitute Revolving Loans and Obligations, and\nbear interest at the rate applicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans.\n(c) Making of Revolving Loans.\n(i)In the event that Swing Lender is not obligated to make a Swing Loan, then after receipt of a\nrequest for a Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.3(a)(i), Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, email, or other\nelectronic form of transmission, of the requested Borrowing; such notification to be sent on the Business Day or U.S.\nGovernment Securities Business Day, as applicable, that is (A) in the case of a Base Rate Loan, at least one Business Day prior to\nthe requested Funding Date, or (B) in the case of a SOFR Loan, prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three U.S. Government Securities\nBusiness Days prior to the requested Funding Date. If Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing on the Business\nDay that is one Business Day prior to the Funding Date, then each Lender shall make the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata\nShare of the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent’s Account, not later than 10:00\na.m. on the Business Day that is the requested Funding Date. After Agent’s receipt of the proceeds of such Revolving Loans from\nthe Lenders, Agent shall make the proceeds thereof available to Borrowers on the applicable Funding Date by transferring\nimmediately available funds equal to such proceeds received by Agent to the Designated Account; provided, that subject to the\nprovisions of Section 2.3(d)(ii), no Lender shall have an obligation to make any Revolving Loan, if (1) one or more of the\napplicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 will not be satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable\nBorrowing unless such condition has been waived, or (2) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such\nFunding Date.\n49\n(ii) Unless Agent receives notice from a Lender prior to 9:30 a.m. on the Business Day that is the requested\nFunding Date relative to a requested Borrowing as to which Agent has notified the Lenders of a requested Borrowing that such\nLender will not make available as and when required hereunder to Agent for the account of Borrowers the amount of that Lender’s\nPro Rata Share of the Borrowing, Agent may assume that each Lender has made or will make such amount available to Agent in\nimmediately available funds on the Funding Date and Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such assumption,\nmake available to Borrowers a corresponding amount. If, on the requested Funding Date, any Lender shall not have remitted the\nfull amount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds and if Agent has made available to\nBorrowers such amount on the requested Funding Date, then such Lender shall make the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share\nof the requested Borrowing available to Agent in immediately available funds, to Agent’s Account, no later than 10:00 a.m. on the\nBusiness Day that is the first Business Day after the requested Funding Date (in which case, the interest accrued on such Lender’s\nportion of such Borrowing for the Funding Date shall be for Agent’s separate account). If any Lender shall not remit the full\namount that it is required to make available to Agent in immediately available funds as and when required hereby and if Agent has\nmade available to Borrowers such amount, then that Lender shall be obligated to immediately remit such amount to Agent, together\nwith interest at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each day until the date on which such amount is so remitted. A notice submitted by\nAgent to any Lender with respect to amounts owing under this Section 2.3(c)(ii) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. If the\namount that a Lender is required to remit is made available to Agent, then such payment to Agent shall constitute such Lender’s\nRevolving Loan for all purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to Agent on the Business Day following\nthe Funding Date, Agent will notify Administrative Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by Agent, Borrowers shall\npay such amount to Agent for Agent’s account, together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of such\nBorrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans composing such Borrowing.\n(d) Protective Advances and Optional Overadvances.\n(i)Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding (but\nsubject to Section 2.3(d)(iv)), at any time (A) after the occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or an Event of Default,\nor (B) that any of the other applicable conditions precedent set forth in Section 3 are not satisfied, Agent hereby is authorized by\nBorrowers and the Lenders, from time to time, in Agent’s sole discretion, to make Revolving Loans to, or for the benefit of,\nBorrowers, on behalf of the Revolving Lenders, that Agent, in its Permitted Discretion, deems necessary or desirable (1) to preserve\nor protect the Collateral, or any portion thereof, or (2) to enhance the likelihood of repayment of the Obligations (other than the\nBank Product Obligations) (the Revolving Loans described in this Section 2.3(d)(i) shall be referred to as “Protective Advances”).\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of all Protective Advances outstanding at any one time shall not exceed the\ngreater of 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount and $57,500,000.\n(ii)Any contrary provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document notwithstanding, the\nLenders hereby authorize Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, and either Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, may, but is not\nobligated to, knowingly and intentionally, continue to make Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans) to Borrowers\nnotwithstanding that an Overadvance exists or would be created thereby, so long as (A) after giving effect to such Revolving Loans,\nthe outstanding Revolver Usage does not exceed the Borrowing Base by the greater of 10% of the Maximum Revolver Amount and\n50\n$57,500,000, and (B) subject to Section 2.3(d)(iv) below, after giving effect to such Revolving Loans, the outstanding Revolver\nUsage (except for and excluding amounts charged to the Loan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) does not\nexceed the Maximum Revolver Amount. In the event Agent obtains actual knowledge that the Revolver Usage exceeds the amounts\npermitted by this Section 2.3(d), regardless of the amount of, or reason for, such excess, Agent shall notify the Lenders as soon as\npracticable (and prior to making any (or any additional) intentional Overadvances (except for and excluding amounts charged to the\nLoan Account for interest, fees, or Lender Group Expenses) unless Agent determines that prior notice would result in imminent\nharm to the Collateral or its value, in which case Agent may make such Overadvances and provide notice as promptly as\npracticable thereafter), and the Lenders with Revolver Commitments thereupon shall, together with Agent, jointly determine the\nterms of arrangements that shall be implemented with Borrowers intended to reduce, within a reasonable time, the outstanding\nprincipal amount of the Revolving Loans to Borrowers to an amount permitted by the preceding sentence. In such circumstances, if\nany Lender with a Revolver Commitment objects to the proposed terms of reduction or repayment of any Overadvance, the terms\nof reduction or repayment thereof shall be implemented according to the determination of the Required Lenders.\n(iii)Each Protective Advance and each Overadvance (each, an “Extraordinary Advance”) shall be\ndeemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, except that no Extraordinary Advance shall be eligible to be a SOFR Loan. Prior to\nSettlement of any Extraordinary Advance, all payments with respect thereto, including interest thereon, shall be payable to Agent\nsolely for its own account. Each Revolving Lender shall be obligated to settle with Agent as provided in Section 2.3(e) (or\nSection 2.3(g), as applicable) for the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Extraordinary Advance. The Extraordinary\nAdvances shall be repayable on demand, secured by Agent’s Liens, constitute Obligations hereunder, and bear interest at the rate\napplicable from time to time to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans. The provisions of this Section 2.3(d) are for the\nexclusive benefit of Agent, Swing Lender, and the Lenders and are not intended to benefit Borrowers (or any other Loan Party) in\nany way.\n(iv)Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the\ncontrary, (A) no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance would cause the aggregate\nprincipal amount of Extraordinary Advances outstanding to exceed an amount equal to the greater of 10% of the Maximum\nRevolver Amount and $57,500,000, and (B) no Extraordinary Advance may be made by Agent if such Extraordinary Advance\nwould cause the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount or any Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the\nRevolver Usage to exceed such Lender’s Revolver Commitments; provided that Agent may make Extraordinary Advances in\nexcess of the limitation set forth in the preceding clause (B) (but subject to the other limitations set forth in this Section 2.3(d))\nso long as such Extraordinary Advances that cause the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount or a\nLender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolver Usage to exceed such Lender’s Revolver Commitments are for Agent’s sole and\nseparate account and not for the account of any Lender. No Lender shall have an obligation to settle with Agent for such\nExtraordinary Advances that cause the aggregate Revolver Usage to exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount or a Lender’s Pro\nRata Share of the Revolver Usage to exceed such Lender’s Revolver Commitments as provided in Section 2.3(e) (or Section\n2.3(g), as applicable).\n(e) Settlement. It is agreed that each Lender’s funded portion of the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to\nequal, at all times, such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the\n51\noutstanding Revolving Loans. Such agreement notwithstanding, Agent, Swing Lender, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement shall not be\nfor the benefit of Borrowers) that in order to facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, settlement among the\nLenders as to the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with\nthe following provisions:\n(i) Agent shall request settlement (“Settlement”) with the Lenders on a weekly basis, or on a more\nfrequent basis if so determined by Agent in its sole discretion (1) on behalf of Swing Lender, with respect to the outstanding Swing\nLoans, (2) for itself, with respect to the outstanding Extraordinary Advances, and (3) with respect to any Loan Party’s or any of their\nSubsidiaries’ payments or other amounts received, as to each by notifying the Lenders by telecopy, telephone, or other similar form\nof transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such\nrequested Settlement (the date of such requested Settlement being the “Settlement Date”). Such notice of a Settlement Date shall\ninclude a summary statement of the amount of outstanding Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances)\nfor the period since the prior Settlement Date. Subject to the terms and conditions contained herein (including Section 2.3(g)): (y) if\nthe amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender that is not a Defaulting\nLender exceeds such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a\nSettlement Date, then Agent shall, by no later than 12:00 p.m. noon on the Settlement Date, transfer in immediately available funds\nto a Deposit Account of such Lender (as such Lender may designate), an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon receipt of\nsuch amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary\nAdvances), and (z) if the amount of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) made by a Lender is\nless than such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a\nSettlement Date, such Lender shall no later than 12:00 p.m. noon on the Settlement Date transfer in immediately available funds to\nAgent’s Account, an amount such that each such Lender shall, upon transfer of such amount, have as of the Settlement Date, its Pro\nRata Share of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances). Such amounts made available to Agent\nunder clause (z) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied against the amounts of the applicable Swing Loans or\nExtraordinary Advances and, together with the portion of such Swing Loans or Extraordinary Advances representing Swing Lender’s\nPro Rata Share thereof, shall constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders. If any such amount is not made available to Agent by any\nLender on the Settlement Date applicable thereto to the extent required by the terms hereof, Agent shall be entitled to recover for its\naccount such amount on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate.\n(ii)In determining whether a Lender’s balance of the Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans and\nExtraordinary Advances) is less than, equal to, or greater than such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans (including\nSwing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) as of a Settlement Date, Agent shall, as part of the relevant Settlement, apply to such\nbalance the portion of payments actually received in good funds by Agent with respect to principal, interest, fees payable by\nBorrowers and allocable to the Lenders hereunder, and proceeds of Collateral.\n(iii)Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans are\noutstanding, may pay over to Agent or Swing Lender, as applicable, any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in\naccordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to\n52\nthe Extraordinary Advances or Swing Loans. Between Settlement Dates, Agent, to the extent no Extraordinary Advances or Swing\nLoans are outstanding, may pay over to Swing Lender any payments or other amounts received by Agent, that in accordance with\nthe terms of this Agreement would be applied to the reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to Swing Lender’s Pro Rata\nShare of the Revolving Loans. If, as of any Settlement Date, payments or other amounts of the Loan Parties or their Subsidiaries\nreceived since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied to Swing Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the\nRevolving Loans other than to Swing Loans, as provided for in the previous sentence, Swing Lender shall pay to Agent for the\naccounts of the Lenders, and Agent shall pay to the Lenders (other than a Defaulting Lender if Agent has implemented the\nprovisions of Section 2.3(g)), to be applied to the outstanding Revolving Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each such\nLender shall, upon receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Loans. During the\nperiod between Settlement Dates, Swing Lender with respect to Swing Loans, Agent with respect to Extraordinary Advances, and\neach Lender with respect to the Revolving Loans other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances, shall be entitled to interest\nat the applicable rate or rates payable under this Agreement on the daily amount of funds employed by Swing Lender, Agent, or the\nLenders, as applicable.\n(iv)Anything in this Section 2.3(e) to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that a Lender is a\nDefaulting Lender, Agent shall be entitled to refrain from remitting settlement amounts to the Defaulting Lender and, instead, shall\nbe entitled to elect to implement the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(g).\n(f) Notation. Consistent with Section 13.1(h), Agent, as a non-fiduciary agent for Borrowers, shall maintain a\nregister showing the principal amount and stated interest of the Revolving Loans owing to each Lender, including the Swing Loans owing to\nSwing Lender, and Extraordinary Advances owing to Agent, and the interests therein of each Lender, from time to time and such register shall,\nabsent manifest error, conclusively be presumed to be correct and accurate.\n(g) Defaulting Lenders.\n(i) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.4(b)(iii), Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a\nDefaulting Lender any payments made by Borrowers to Agent for the Defaulting Lender’s benefit or any proceeds of Collateral that\nwould otherwise be remitted hereunder to the Defaulting Lender, and, in the absence of such transfer to the Defaulting Lender, Agent\nshall transfer any such payments (A) first, to Agent to the extent of any Extraordinary Advances that were made by Agent and that\nwere required to be, but were not, paid by Defaulting Lender, (B) second, to Swing Lender to the extent of any Swing Loans that\nwere made by Swing Lender and that were required to be, but were not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (C) third, to Issuing Bank, to\nthe extent of the portion of a Letter of Credit Disbursement that was required to be, but was not, paid by the Defaulting Lender, (D)\nfourth, to each Non-Defaulting Lender ratably in accordance with their Commitments (but, in each case, only to the extent that such\nDefaulting Lender’s portion of a Revolving Loan (or other funding obligation) was funded by such other Non-Defaulting Lender), (E)\nfifth, in Agent’s sole discretion, to a suspense account maintained by Agent, the proceeds of which shall be retained by Agent and may\nbe made available to be re-advanced to or for the benefit of Borrowers (upon the request of Borrowers and subject to the conditions\nset forth in Section 3.2) as if such Defaulting Lender had made its portion of Revolving Loans (or other funding obligations)\nhereunder, and (F) sixth, from and after the date on which all other Obligations have been paid in full, to such Defaulting Lender in\naccordance with tier (M) of Section 2.4(b)(iii). Subject to the foregoing, Agent may hold and, in its discretion, re-lend to Borrowers\nfor the account of such Defaulting Lender the amount of\n53\nall such payments received and retained by Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Solely for the purposes of voting or\nconsenting to matters with respect to the Loan Documents (including the calculation of Pro Rata Share in connection therewith) and\nfor the purpose of calculating the fee payable under Section 2.10(b), such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a “Lender”\nand such Lender’s Commitment shall be deemed to be zero; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the matters\ngoverned by Section 14.1(a)(i) through (iii). The provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall remain effective with respect to such\nDefaulting Lender until the earlier of (y) the date on which all of the Non-Defaulting Lenders, Agent, Issuing Bank, and Borrowers\nshall have waived, in writing, the application of this Section 2.3(g) to such Defaulting Lender, or (z) the date on which such\nDefaulting Lender makes payment of all amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, pays to Agent all amounts owing by\nDefaulting Lender in respect of the amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder, and, if requested by Agent, provides adequate\nassurance of its ability to perform its future obligations hereunder (on which earlier date, so long as no Event of Default has occurred\nand is continuing, any remaining cash collateral held by Agent pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii) shall be released to Borrowers). The\noperation of this Section 2.3(g) shall not be construed to increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, to relieve or\nexcuse the performance by such Defaulting Lender or any other Lender of its duties and obligations hereunder, or to relieve or excuse\nthe performance by any Borrower of its duties and obligations hereunder to Agent, Issuing Bank, or to the Lenders other than such\nDefaulting Lender. Any failure by a Defaulting Lender to fund amounts that it was obligated to fund hereunder shall constitute a\nmaterial breach by such Defaulting Lender of this Agreement and shall entitle Borrowers, at their option, upon written notice to\nAgent, to arrange for a substitute Lender to assume the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender, such substitute Lender to be\nreasonably acceptable to Agent. In connection with the arrangement of such a substitute Lender, the Defaulting Lender shall have no\nright to refuse to be replaced hereunder, and agrees to execute and deliver a completed form of Assignment and Acceptance in favor\nof the substitute Lender (and agrees that it shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such document if it fails to do so) subject\nonly to being paid its share of the outstanding Obligations (other than Bank Product Obligations, but including (1) all interest, fees,\nand other amounts that may be due and payable in respect thereof, and (2) an assumption of its Pro Rata Share of its participation in\nthe Letters of Credit); provided, that any such assumption of the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender shall not be deemed to\nconstitute a waiver of any of the Lender Groups’ or Borrowers’ rights or remedies against any such Defaulting Lender arising out of\nor in relation to such failure to fund. In the event of a direct conflict between the priority provisions of this Section 2.3(g) and any\nother provision contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions\nbe read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in concert with each other. In the event of any actual,\nirreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this Section 2.3(g) shall control and govern.\n(ii)If any Swing Loan or Letter of Credit is outstanding at the time that a Lender becomes a Defaulting\nLender then:\n(A) such Defaulting Lender’s Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders\nin accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares but only to the extent (x) the sum of all Non-Defaulting Lenders’ Pro Rata Share of\nRevolver Usage plus such Defaulting Lender’s Swing Loan Exposure and Letter of Credit Exposure does not exceed the total of all\nNon-Defaulting Lenders’ Revolver Commitments and (y) the conditions set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied at such time;\n54\n(B) if the reallocation described in clause (A) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, Borrowers shall within one Business Day\nfollowing notice by the Agent (x) first, prepay such Defaulting Lender’s Swing Loan Exposure (after giving effect to any partial\nreallocation pursuant to clause (A) above), and (y) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure (after\ngiving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to clause (A) above), pursuant to a cash collateral agreement to be entered into in form\nand substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, for so long as such Letter of Credit Exposure is outstanding; provided, that\nBorrowers shall not be obligated to cash collateralize any Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure if such Defaulting Lender is\nalso Issuing Bank;\n(C) if Borrowers cash collateralize any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii),\nBorrowers shall not be required to pay any Letter of Credit Fees to Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section\n2.6(b) with respect to such cash collateralized portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure during the period such\nLetter of Credit Exposure is cash collateralized;\n(D) to the extent the Letter of Credit Exposure of the Non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), then the\nLetter of Credit Fees payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders pursuant to Section 2.6(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with such Non-\nDefaulting Lenders’ Letter of Credit Exposure;\n(E) to the extent any Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is neither cash collateralized nor reallocated pursuant to this Section\n2.3(g)(ii), then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all Letter of Credit Fees that\nwould have otherwise been payable to such Defaulting Lender under Section 2.6(b) with respect to such portion of such Letter of Credit\nExposure shall instead be payable to Issuing Bank until such portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure is cash\ncollateralized or reallocated;\n(F) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swing Lender shall not be required to make any Swing Loan and Issuing\nBank shall not be required to issue, amend, or increase any Letter of Credit, in each case, to the extent (x) the Defaulting\nLender’s Pro Rata Share of such Swing Loans or Letter of Credit cannot be reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii), or\n(y) the Swing Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, has not otherwise entered into arrangements reasonably satisfactory to\nthe Swing Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, and Borrowers to eliminate the Swing Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s risk with\nrespect to the Defaulting Lender’s participation in Swing Loans or Letters of Credit; and\n(G) Agent may release any cash collateral provided by Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.3(g)(ii) to Issuing Bank and Issuing Bank may\napply any such cash collateral to the payment of such Defaulting Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement that is\nnot reimbursed by Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.11(d). Subject to Section 17.14, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver\nor release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender,\nincluding any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non-Defaulting Lender’s increased exposure following such\nreallocation.\n(h) Independent Obligations. All Revolving Loans (other than Swing Loans and Extraordinary Advances) shall be\nmade by the Lenders contemporaneously and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no Lender shall be responsible for\nany failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loan (or other extension of credit) hereunder, nor shall any\nCommitment of any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other\n55\nLender to perform its obligations hereunder, and (ii) no failure by any Lender to perform its obligations hereunder shall excuse any other Lender\nfrom its obligations hereunder.\n2.4 Payments; Reductions of Commitments; Prepayments.\n(a) Payments by Borrowers.\n(i)Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by Borrowers shall be made to Agent’s\nAccount for the account of the Lender Group and shall be made in immediately available funds, without set off or counterclaim, no\nlater than 1:30 p.m. on the date specified herein; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any payments deposited into a\nControlled Account shall be deemed not to be received by Agent on any Business Day unless immediately available funds have\nbeen credited to Agent’s Account prior to 1:30 p.m. on such Business Day. Any payment received by Agent in immediately\navailable funds in Agent’s Account later than 1:30 p.m. shall be deemed to have been received (unless Agent, in its sole discretion,\nelects to credit it on the date received) on the following Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue\nuntil such following Business Day.\n(ii)Unless Agent receives notice from Borrowers prior to the date on which any payment is due to the\nLenders that Borrowers will not make such payment in full as and when required, Agent may assume that Borrowers have made (or\nwill make) such payment in full to Agent on such date in immediately available funds and Agent may (but shall not be so required),\nin reliance upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.\nIf and to the extent Borrowers do not make such payment in full to Agent on the date when due, each Lender severally shall repay\nto Agent on demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at the Defaulting Lender Rate for each\nday from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date repaid.\n(b) Apportionment and Application.\n(i) So long as no Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein\nwith respect to Defaulting Lenders, all principal and interest payments received by Agent shall be apportioned ratably among the\nLenders (according to the unpaid principal balance of the Obligations to which such payments relate held by each Lender) and all\npayments of fees and expenses received by Agent (other than fees or expenses that are for Agent’s separate account or for the\nseparate account of Issuing Bank) shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders having a Pro Rata Share of the type of\nCommitment or Obligation to which a particular fee or expense relates.\n(ii)Subject to Section 2.4(b)(v) and Section 2.4(e), all payments to be made hereunder by Borrowers\nshall be remitted to Agent and all such payments, and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent, shall be applied, so long as no\nApplication Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise provided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, to\nreduce the balance of the Revolving Loans outstanding and, thereafter, to Borrowers (to be wired to the Designated Account) or\nsuch other Person entitled thereto under applicable law.\n(iii)At any time that an Application Event has occurred and is continuing and except as otherwise\nprovided herein with respect to Defaulting Lenders, all\n56\npayments remitted to Agent and all proceeds of Collateral received by Agent shall be applied as follows:\n(A) first, to pay any Lender Group Expenses (including cost or expense reimbursements) or indemnities then due to Agent under the Loan\nDocuments and to pay interest and principal on Extraordinary Advances that are held solely by Agent pursuant

Issuing Bank’s records of\nthe content of any such request will be conclusive. Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, Issuing Bank may, but shall not be\nobligated to, issue a Letter of Credit that supports the obligations of a Loan Party or one of its Subsidiaries in respect of x) a lease of real property,\nor (y) an employment contract.\n(b) No Issuing Bank shall have any obligation to issue a Letter of Credit if any of the following would result after\ngiving effect to the requested issuance:\n(i)the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Letter of Credit Sublimit, or\n(ii)the Letter of Credit Usage related to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank would exceed\nthe Issuing Bank Sublimit of such Issuing Bank, or\n(iii)the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Maximum Revolver Amount less the outstanding\namount of Revolving Loans (including Swing Loans), or\n63\n(iv)the Letter of Credit Usage would exceed the Borrowing Base at such time less the outstanding\nprincipal balance of the Revolving Loans (inclusive of Swing Loans) at such time.\n(c) In the event there is a Defaulting Lender as of the date of any request for the issuance of a Letter of Credit,\nIssuing Bank shall not be required to issue or arrange for such Letter of Credit to the extent (i) the Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure\nwith respect to such Letter of Credit may not be reallocated pursuant to Section 2.3(g)(ii), or (ii) Issuing Bank has not otherwise entered into\narrangements reasonably satisfactory to it and Borrowers to eliminate Issuing Bank’s risk with respect to the participation in such Letter of Credit\nof the Defaulting Lender, which arrangements may include Borrowers cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender’s Letter of Credit Exposure in\naccordance with Section 2.3(g)(ii). Additionally, Issuing Bank shall have no obligation to issue or extend a Letter of Credit if (A) any order,\njudgment, or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall, by its terms, purport to enjoin or restrain Issuing Bank from issuing such\nLetter of Credit, or any law applicable to Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any\nGovernmental Authority with jurisdiction over Issuing Bank shall prohibit or request that Issuing Bank refrain from the issuance of letters of\ncredit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular, (B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of Issuing Bank\napplicable to letters of credit generally, or (C) if amounts demanded to be paid under any Letter of Credit will not or may not be in United States\nDollars.\n(d) Any Issuing Bank (other than Wells Fargo or any of its Affiliates) shall notify Agent in writing no later than the\nBusiness Day prior to the Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues any Letter of Credit. In addition, each Issuing Bank (other than Wells\nFargo or any of its Affiliates) shall, on the first Business Day of each week, submit to Agent a report detailing the daily undrawn amount of each\nLetter of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank during the prior calendar week. Borrowers and the Lender Group hereby acknowledge and agree that\nall Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute Letters of Credit under this Agreement on and after the Closing Date with the same effect as if such\nExisting Letters of Credit were issued by Issuing Bank at the request of Borrowers on the Closing Date. Each Letter of Credit shall be in form and\nsubstance reasonably acceptable to Issuing Bank, including the requirement that the amounts payable thereunder must be payable in Dollars. If\nIssuing Bank makes a payment under a Letter of Credit, Borrowers shall pay to Agent an amount equal to the applicable Letter of Credit\nDisbursement on the Business Day such Letter of Credit Disbursement is made and, in the absence of such payment, the amount of the Letter of\nCredit Disbursement immediately and automatically shall be deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder (notwithstanding any failure to satisfy\nany condition precedent set forth in Section 3) and, initially, shall bear interest at the rate then applicable to Revolving Loans that are Base Rate\nLoans. If a Letter of Credit Disbursement is deemed to be a Revolving Loan hereunder, Borrowers’ obligation to pay the amount of such Letter of\nCredit Disbursement to Issuing Bank shall be automatically converted into an obligation to pay the resulting Revolving Loan. Promptly following\nreceipt by Agent of any payment from Borrowers pursuant to this Section 2.11(d), Agent shall distribute such payment to Issuing Bank or, to the\nextent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to Section 2.11(e) to reimburse Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and\nIssuing Bank as their interests may appear.\n(e) Promptly following receipt of a notice of a Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to Section 2.11(d), each\nRevolving Lender agrees to fund its Pro Rata Share of any Revolving Loan deemed made pursuant to Section 2.11(d) on the same terms and\nconditions as if Borrowers had requested the amount thereof as a Revolving Loan and Agent shall promptly pay to Issuing Bank the amounts so\nreceived by it from the Revolving Lenders. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment, renewal, or extension of a Letter of Credit)\nand without any further action on the part of Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have granted to each\nRevolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, a participation in each Letter of Credit\n64\nissued by Issuing Bank, in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such Letter of Credit, and each such Revolving Lender agrees to pay to Agent,\nfor the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Letter of Credit Disbursement made by Issuing Bank under the\napplicable Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally\nagrees to pay to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of each Letter of Credit Disbursement made by\nIssuing Bank and not reimbursed by Borrowers on the date due as provided in Section 2.11(d), or of any reimbursement payment that is required\nto be refunded (or that Agent or Issuing Bank elects, based upon the advice of counsel, to refund) to Borrowers for any reason. Each Revolving\nLender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to deliver to Agent, for the account of Issuing Bank, an amount equal to its respective Pro Rata\nShare of each Letter of Credit Disbursement pursuant to this Section 2.11(e) shall be absolute and unconditional and such remittance shall be\nmade notwithstanding the occurrence or continuation of an Event of Default or Default or the failure to satisfy any condition set forth in Section\n3. If any such Revolving Lender fails to make available to Agent the amount of such Revolving Lender’s Pro Rata Share of a Letter of Credit\nDisbursement as provided in this this Section 2.11, such Revolving Lender shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender and Agent (for the account\nof Issuing Bank) shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Revolving Lender together with interest thereon at the Defaulting\nLender Rate until paid in full.\n(f) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each member of the Lender Group (including\nIssuing Bank and its branches, Affiliates, and correspondents) and each such Person’s respective directors, officers, employees, attorneys and\nagents (each, including Issuing Bank, a “Letter of Credit Related Person”) (to the fullest extent permitted by law) from and against any and all\nclaims, demands, suits, actions, investigations, proceedings, liabilities, fines, costs, penalties, and damages, and all reasonable fees and\ndisbursements of attorneys, experts, or consultants and all other costs and expenses actually incurred in connection therewith or in connection\nwith the enforcement of this indemnification (as and when they are incurred and irrespective of whether suit is brought), which may be incurred\nby or awarded against any such Letter of Credit Related Person (other than Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 16) (the “Letter of Credit\nIndemnified Costs”), and which arise out of or in connection with, or as a result of:\n(i)any Letter of Credit or any pre-advice of its issuance;\n(ii)any transfer, sale, delivery, surrender or endorsement (or lack thereof) of any Drawing Document\nat any time(s) held by any such Letter of Credit Related Person in connection with any Letter of Credit;\n(iii)any action or proceeding arising out of, or in connection with, any Letter of Credit (whether\nadministrative, judicial or in connection with arbitration), including any action or proceeding to compel or restrain any presentation\nor payment under any Letter of Credit, or for the wrongful dishonor of, or honoring a presentation under, any Letter of Credit;\n(iv)any independent undertakings issued by the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit;\n(v)any unauthorized instruction or request made to Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of\nCredit or requested Letter of Credit, or any error, omission, interruption or delay in such instruction or request, whether transmitted\nby mail, courier, electronic transmission, SWIFT, or any other telecommunication including communications through a\ncorrespondent;\n65\n(vi)an adviser, confirmer or other nominated person seeking to be reimbursed, indemnified or\ncompensated;\n(vii)any third party seeking to enforce the rights of an applicant, beneficiary, nominated person,\ntransferee, assignee of Letter of Credit proceeds or holder of an instrument or document;\n(viii)the fraud, forgery or illegal action of parties other than the Letter of Credit Related Person;\n(ix) any prohibition on payment of any amount payable by Issuing Bank to a beneficiary or\ntransferee beneficiary of a Letter of Credit arising out of Anti-Corruption Laws, Anti-Money Laundering Laws, or Sanctions;\n(x)Issuing Bank’s performance of the obligations of a confirming institution or entity that wrongfully\ndishonors a confirmation;\n(xi)any foreign language translation provided to Issuing Bank in connection with any Letter of Credit;\n(xii)any foreign law or usage as it relates to Issuing Bank’s issuance of a Letter of Credit in support of\na foreign guaranty including the expiration of such guaranty after the related Letter of Credit expiration date and any resulting\ndrawing paid by Issuing Bank in connection therewith; or\n(xiii)the acts or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de facto\ngovernmental or regulatory authority or cause or event beyond the control of the Letter of Credit Related Person;\nprovided, that such indemnity shall not be available to any Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnification under clauses (i) through\n(xiii) above to the extent that such Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs may be finally determined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction to have resulted directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming\nindemnity. Borrowers hereby agree to pay the Letter of Credit Related Person claiming indemnity on demand from time to time all amounts\nowing under this Section 2.11(f). If and to the extent that the obligations of Borrowers under this Section 2.11(f) are unenforceable for any reason,\nBorrowers agree to make the maximum contribution to the Letter of Credit Indemnified Costs permissible under applicable law. This\nindemnification provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and all Letters of Credit.\n(g) The liability of Issuing Bank (or any other Letter of Credit Related Person) under, in connection with or arising out of\nany Letter of Credit (or pre-advice), regardless of the form or legal grounds of the action or proceeding, shall be limited to direct damages\nsuffered by Borrowers that are caused directly by Issuing Bank’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in (i) honoring a presentation under a\nLetter of Credit that on its face does not at least substantially comply with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, (ii) failing to honor a\npresentation under a Letter of Credit that strictly complies with the terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, or (iii) retaining Drawing\nDocuments presented under a Letter of Credit. Borrowers’ aggregate remedies against Issuing Bank and any Letter of Credit Related Person for\nwrongfully honoring a presentation under any Letter of Credit or wrongfully retaining honored Drawing Documents shall in no event exceed the\naggregate amount paid by Borrowers to Issuing Bank in respect of the honored presentation in connection with such Letter of Credit under\nSection 2.11(d), plus interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder. Borrowers shall take action to avoid\n66\nand mitigate the amount of any damages claimed against Issuing Bank or any other Letter of Credit Related Person, including by enforcing its\nrights against the beneficiaries of the Letters of Credit. Any claim by Borrowers under or in connection with any Letter of Credit shall be reduced\nby an amount equal to the sum of (x) the amount (if any) saved by Borrowers as a result of the breach or alleged wrongful conduct complained of,\nand (y) the amount (if any) of the loss that would have been avoided had Borrowers taken all reasonable steps to mitigate any loss, and in case of\na claim of wrongful dishonor, by specifically and timely authorizing Issuing Bank to effect a cure.\n(h) Borrowers are responsible for the final text of the Letter of Credit as issued by Issuing Bank, irrespective of any\nassistance Issuing Bank may provide such as drafting or recommending text or by Issuing Bank’s use or refusal to use text submitted by\nBorrowers. Borrowers understand that the final form of any Letter of Credit may be subject to such revisions and changes as are deemed\nnecessary or appropriate by Issuing Bank, and Borrowers hereby consent to such revisions and changes not materially different from the\napplication executed in connection therewith. Borrowers are solely responsible for the suitability of the Letter of Credit for Borrowers’ purposes.\nIf Borrowers request Issuing Bank to issue a Letter of Credit for an affiliated or unaffiliated third party (an “Account Party”), (i) such Account\nParty shall have no rights against Issuing Bank; (ii) Borrowers shall be responsible for the application and obligations under this Agreement; and\n(iii) communications (including notices) related to the respective Letter of Credit shall be among Issuing Bank and Borrowers. Borrowers will\nexamine the copy of the Letter of Credit and any other documents sent by Issuing Bank in connection therewith and shall promptly notify Issuing\nBank (not later than three (3) Business Days following Borrowers’ receipt of documents from Issuing Bank) of any non-compliance with\nBorrowers’ instructions and of any discrepancy in any document under any presentment or other irregularity. Borrowers understand and agree that\nIssuing Bank is not required to extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit for any reason. With respect to any Letter of Credit containing an\n“automatic amendment” to extend the expiration date of such Letter of Credit, Issuing Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, may give notice of\nnonrenewal of such Letter of Credit and, if Borrowers do not at any time want the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit to be\nextended, Borrowers will so notify Agent and Issuing Bank at least 30 calendar days before Issuing Bank is required to notify the beneficiary of\nsuch Letter of Credit or any advising bank of such non-extension pursuant to the terms of such Letter of Credit.\n(i) Borrowers’ reimbursement and payment obligations under this Section 2.11 are absolute, unconditional and\nirrevocable and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever, including:\n(i)any lack of validity, enforceability or legal effect of any Letter of Credit, any Issuer Document, this\nAgreement, or any Loan Document, or any term or provision therein or herein;\n(ii)payment against presentation of any draft, demand or claim for payment under any Drawing\nDocument that does not comply in whole or in part with the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit or which proves to be\nfraudulent, forged or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, or which is signed,\nissued or presented by a Person or a transferee of such Person purporting to be a successor or transferee of the beneficiary of such\nLetter of Credit;\n(iii)Issuing Bank or any of its branches or Affiliates being the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit;\n67\n(iv) Issuing Bank or any correspondent honoring a drawing against a Drawing Document up to the amount\navailable under any Letter of Credit even if such Drawing Document claims an amount in excess of the amount available under the\nLetter of Credit;\n(v)the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other right that any Loan Party or any of its\nSubsidiaries may have at any time against any beneficiary or transferee beneficiary, any assignee of proceeds, Issuing Bank or any\nother Person;\n(vi)Issuing Bank or any correspondent honoring a drawing upon receipt of an electronic presentation\nunder a Letter of Credit requiring the same, regardless of whether the original Drawing Documents arrive at Issuing Bank’s\ncounters or are different from the electronic presentation;\n(vii)any other event, circumstance or conduct whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the\nforegoing that might, but for this Section 2.11(i), constitute a legal or equitable defense to or discharge of, or provide a right of set-\noff against, any Borrower’s or any of its Subsidiaries’ reimbursement and other payment obligations and liabilities, arising under, or\nin connection with, any Letter of Credit, whether against Issuing Bank, the beneficiary or any other Person; or\n(viii)the fact that any Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;\nprovided, that subject to Section 2.11(f) above, the foregoing shall not release Issuing Bank from such liability to Borrowers as may be finally\ndetermined in a final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction against Issuing Bank following reimbursement or payment of\nthe obligations and liabilities, including reimbursement and other payment obligations, of Borrowers to Issuing Bank arising under, or in\nconnection with, this Section 2.11 or any Letter of Credit.\n(j) Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, Issuing Bank and each other Letter of Credit Related\nPerson (if applicable) shall not be responsible to Borrowers for, and Issuing Bank’s rights and remedies against Borrowers and the obligation of\nBorrowers to reimburse Issuing Bank for each drawing under each Letter of Credit shall not be impaired by:\n(i)honor of a presentation under any Letter of Credit that on its face substantially complies with the\nterms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, even if the Letter of Credit requires strict compliance by the beneficiary;\n(ii)honor of a presentation of any Drawing Document that appears on its face to have been signed,\npresented or issued (A) by any purported successor or transferee of any beneficiary or other Person required to sign, present or\nissue such Drawing Document or (B) under a new name of the beneficiary;\n(iii)acceptance as a draft of any written or electronic demand or request for payment under a Letter of\nCredit, even if nonnegotiable or not in the form of a draft or notwithstanding any requirement that such draft, demand or request\nbear any or adequate reference to the Letter of Credit;\n(iv) the identity or authority of any presenter or signer of any Drawing Document or the form, accuracy,\ngenuineness or legal effect of any Drawing Document (other\n68\nthan Issuing Bank’s determination that such Drawing Document appears on its face substantially to comply with the terms and\nconditions of the Letter of Credit);\n(v)acting upon any instruction or request relative to a Letter of Credit or requested Letter of Credit\nthat Issuing Bank in good faith believes to have been given by a Person authorized to give such instruction or request;\n(vi)any errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any message, advice or\ndocument (regardless of how sent or transmitted) or for errors in interpretation of technical terms or in translation or any delay in\ngiving or failing to give notice to any Borrower;\n(vii)any acts, omissions or fraud by, or the insolvency of, any beneficiary, any nominated person or\nentity or any other Person or any breach of contract between any beneficiary and any Borrower or any of the parties to the\nunderlying transaction to which the Letter of Credit relates;\n(viii)assertion or waiver of any provision of the ISP or UCP that primarily benefits an issuer of a letter\nof credit, including any requirement that any Drawing Document be presented to it at a particular hour or place;\n(ix)payment to any presenting bank (designated or permitted by the terms of the applicable Letter of\nCredit) claiming that it rightfully honored or is entitled to reimbursement or indemnity under Standard Letter of Credit Practice\napplicable to it;\n(x)acting or failing to act as required or permitted under Standard Letter of Credit Practice applicable\nto where Issuing Bank has issued, confirmed, advised or negotiated such Letter of Credit, as the case may be;\n(xi)honor of a presentation after the expiration date of any Letter of Credit notwithstanding that a\npresentation was made prior to such expiration date and dishonored by Issuing Bank if subsequently Issuing Bank or any court or\nother finder of fact determines such presentation should have been honored;\n(xii)dishonor of any presentation that does not strictly comply or that is fraudulent, forged or\notherwise not entitled to honor; or\n(xiii)honor of a presentation that is subsequently determined by Issuing Bank to have been made in\nviolation of international, federal, state or local restrictions on the transaction of business with certain prohibited Persons.\n(k) Borrowers shall pay immediately upon demand to Agent for the account of Issuing Bank as non-refundable fees,\ncommissions, and charges (it being acknowledged and agreed that any charging of such fees, commissions, and charges to the Loan Account\npursuant to the provisions of Section 2.6(d) shall be deemed to constitute a demand for payment thereof for the purposes of this Section 2.11(k)):\n(i) a fronting fee which shall be imposed by Issuing Bank equal to 0.125% per annum multiplied by the average amount of the Letter of Credit\nUsage during the immediately preceding month, plus (ii) any and all other customary commissions, fees and charges then in effect imposed by,\nand any and all expenses incurred by, Issuing Bank, or by any adviser, confirming institution or entity or other nominated person, relating to\nLetters of Credit, at the time of issuance of any Letter of Credit and upon the occurrence of any\n69\nother activity with respect to any Letter of Credit (including transfers, assignments of proceeds, amendments, drawings, renewals or\ncancellations).\n(l) If by reason of (x) any Change in Law, or (y) compliance by Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender\nGroup with any direction, request, or requirement (irrespective of whether having the force of law) of any Governmental Authority or monetary\nauthority including, Regulation D of the Board of Governors as from time to time in effect (and any successor thereto):\n(i)any reserve, deposit, or similar requirement is or shall be imposed or modified in respect of any\nLetter of Credit issued or caused to be issued hereunder or hereby, or any Loans or obligations to make Loans hereunder or hereby,\nor\n(ii) there shall be imposed on Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group any other condition\nregarding any Letter of Credit, Loans, or obligations to make Loans hereunder, and the result of the foregoing is to increase,\ndirectly or indirectly, the cost to Issuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group of issuing, making, participating in, or\nmaintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount receivable in respect thereof, then, and in any such case, Agent may, at\nany time within a reasonable period after the additional cost is incurred or the amount received is reduced, notify Borrowers, and\nBorrowers shall pay within 30 days after demand therefor, such amounts as Agent may specify to be necessary to compensate\nIssuing Bank or any other member of the Lender Group for such additional cost or reduced receipt, together with interest on such\namount from the date of such demand until payment in full thereof at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder;\nprovided, that (A) Borrowers shall not be required to provide any compensation pursuant to this Section 2.11(l) for any such\namounts incurred more than 180 days prior to the date on which the demand for payment of such amounts is first made to\nBorrowers, and (B) if an event or circumstance giving rise to such amounts is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above\nshall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The determination by Agent of any amount due pursuant to this\nSection 2.11(l), as set forth in a certificate setting forth the calculation thereof in reasonable detail, shall, in the absence of manifest\nor demonstrable error, be final and conclusive and binding on all of the parties hereto.\n(m)Each standby Letter of Credit shall expire not later than the date that is 12 months after the date of the issuance\nof such Letter of Credit; provided, that any standby Letter of Credit may provide for the automatic extension thereof for any number of additional\nperiods each of up to one year in duration; provided further, that with respect to any Letter of Credit which extends beyond the Maturity Date,\nLetter of Credit Collateralization shall be provided therefor on or before the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date. Each\ncommercial Letter of Credit shall expire on the earlier of (i) 120 days after the date of the issuance of such commercial Letter of Credit and (ii)\nfive Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.\n(n) If (i) any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, or (ii) Availability shall at any time be less than zero,\nthen on the Business Day following the date when the Administrative Borrower receives notice from Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the\nmaturity of the Obligations has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with Letter of Credit Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total\nLetter of Credit Exposure) demanding Letter of Credit Collateralization pursuant to this Section 2.11(n) upon such demand, Borrowers shall\nprovide Letter of Credit Collateralization with respect to the then existing Letter of Credit Usage.\n(o) Unless otherwise expressly agreed by Issuing Bank and Borrowers when a Letter of Credit is issued (including\nany such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), (i) the\n70\nrules of the ISP shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit, and (ii) the rules of the UCP shall apply to each commercial Letter of Credit.\n(p) Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have acted with due diligence and reasonable care if Issuing Bank’s conduct is\nin accordance with Standard Letter of Credit Practice or in accordance with this Agreement.\n(q) In the event of a direct conflict between the provisions of this Section 2.11 and any provision contained in any\nIssuer Document, it is the intention of the parties hereto that such provisions be read together and construed, to the fullest extent possible, to be in\nconcert with each other. In the event of any actual, irreconcilable conflict that cannot be resolved as aforesaid, the terms and provisions of this\nSection 2.11 shall control and govern.\n(r) The provisions of this Section 2.11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of\nthe Obligations with respect to any Letters of Credit that remain outstanding.\n(s) At Borrowers’ costs and expense, Borrowers shall execute and deliver to Issuing Bank such additional\ncertificates, instruments and/or documents and take such additional action as may be reasonably requested by Issuing Bank to enable Issuing Bank\nto issue any Letter of Credit pursuant to this Agreement and related Issuer Document, to protect, exercise and/or enforce Issuing Banks’ rights and\ninterests under this Agreement or to give effect to the terms and provisions of this Agreement or any Issuer Document. Each Borrower irrevocably\nappoints Issuing Bank as its attorney-in-fact and authorizes Issuing Bank, without notice to Borrowers, to execute and deliver ancillary documents\nand letters customary in the letter of credit business that may include but are not limited to advisements, indemnities, checks, bills of exchange\nand issuance documents. The power of attorney granted by the Borrowers is limited solely to such actions related to the issuance, confirmation or\namendment of any Letter of Credit and to ancillary documents or letters customary in the letter of credit business. This appointment is coupled\nwith an interest.\n2.12 SOFR Option.\n(a) Interest and Interest Payment Dates. In lieu of having interest charged at the rate based upon the Base Rate,\nBorrowers shall have the option, subject to Section 2.12(b) below (the “SOFR Option”) to have interest on all or a portion of the Revolving Loans\nbe charged (whether at the time when made (unless otherwise provided herein), upon conversion from a Base Rate Loan to a SOFR Loan, or upon\ncontinuation of a SOFR Loan as a SOFR Loan) at a rate of interest based upon Adjusted Term SOFR. Interest on SOFR Loans shall be payable on\nthe earliest of (i) the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the date on which all or any portion of the Obligations are accelerated\npursuant to the terms hereof, or (iii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof. On the last day of each\napplicable Interest Period, unless Borrowers have properly exercised the SOFR Option with respect thereto, the interest rate applicable to such\nSOFR Loan automatically shall convert to the rate of interest then applicable to Base Rate Loans of the same type hereunder. At any time that an\nEvent of Default has occurred and is continuing, at the written election of Agent or the Required Lenders, Borrowers no longer shall have the\noption to request that Revolving Loans bear interest at a rate based upon Adjusted Term SOFR.\n(b) SOFR Election.\n(i)Borrowers may, at any time and from time to time, so long as Borrowers have not received a\nnotice from Agent (which notice Agent may elect to give or\n71\nnot give in its discretion unless Agent is directed to give such notice by the Required Lenders, in which case, it shall give the\nnotice to Borrowers), after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to terminate the right of Borrowers\nto exercise the SOFR Option during the continuance of such Event of Default, elect to exercise the SOFR Option by notifying\nAgent prior to 11:00 a.m. at least three U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the commencement of the proposed\nInterest Period (the “SOFR Deadline”). Notice of Borrowers’ election of the SOFR Option for a permitted portion of the\nRevolving Loans and an Interest Period pursuant to this Section shall be made by delivery to Agent of a SOFR Notice received\nby Agent before the SOFR Deadline. Promptly upon its receipt of each such SOFR Notice, Agent shall provide a notice thereof\nto each of the affected Lenders.\n(ii)Each SOFR Notice shall be irrevocable and binding on Borrowers. In connection with each SOFR\nLoan, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders harmless against any loss, cost, or expense actually\nincurred by Agent or any Lender as a result of (A) the payment or required assignment of any principal of any SOFR Loan other\nthan on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (B) the conversion of any\nSOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or (C) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or\nprepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any SOFR Notice delivered pursuant hereto (such losses, costs, or expenses,\n“Funding Losses”). A certificate of Agent or a Lender delivered to Borrowers setting forth in reasonable detail any amount or\namounts that Agent or such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.12 shall be conclusive absent manifest error.\nBorrowers shall pay such amount to Agent or the Lender, as applicable, within 30 days of the date of its receipt of such certificate.\nIf a payment of a SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period would result in a Funding Loss,\nAgent may, in its sole discretion at the request of Borrowers, hold the amount of such payment as cash collateral in support of the\nObligations until the last day of such Interest Period and apply such amounts to the payment of the applicable SOFR Loan on such\nlast day of such Interest Period, it being agreed that Agent has no obligation to so defer the application of payments to any SOFR\nLoan and that, in the event that Agent does not defer such application, Borrowers shall be obligated to pay any resulting Funding\nLosses.\n(iii)Unless Agent, in its sole discretion, agrees otherwise, Borrowers shall have not more than 10\nSOFR Loans in effect at any given time. Borrowers may only exercise the SOFR Option for proposed SOFR Loans of at least\n$1,000,000.\n(c) Conversion; Prepayment. Borrowers may convert SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans or prepay SOFR Loans at\nany time; provided, that in the event that SOFR Loans are converted or prepaid on any date that is not the last day of the Interest Period applicable\nthereto, including as a result of any prepayment through the required application by Agent of any payments or proceeds of Collateral in\naccordance with Section 2.4(b) or for any other reason, including early termination of the term of this Agreement or acceleration of all or any\nportion of the Obligations pursuant to the terms hereof, each Borrower shall indemnify, defend, and hold Agent and the Lenders and their\nParticipants harmless against any and all Funding Losses in accordance with Section 2.12(b)(ii).\n(d) Special Provisions Applicable to Adjusted Term SOFR.\n(i)Adjusted Term SOFR may be adjusted by Agent with respect to any Lender on a prospective basis\nto take into account any additional or increased costs (other than Taxes which shall be governed by Section 16), in each case, due to\nchanges in applicable law occurring subsequent to the commencement of the then applicable Interest Period, or\n72\npursuant to any Change in Law or change in the reserve requirements imposed by the Board of Governors, which additional or\nincreased costs would increase the cost of funding or maintaining loans bearing interest at Adjusted Term SOFR. In any such event,\nthe affected Lender shall give Borrowers and Agent notice of such a determination and adjustment and Agent promptly shall\ntransmit the notice to each other Lender and, upon its receipt of the notice from the affected Lender, Borrowers may, by notice to\nsuch affected Lender (A) require such Lender to furnish to Borrowers a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for\nadjusting Adjusted Term SOFR and the method for determining the amount of such adjustment, or (B) repay the SOFR Loans or\nBase Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case, of such Lender with respect to which such\nadjustment is made (together with any amounts due under Section 2.12(b)(ii)).\n(ii)Subject to the provisions set forth in Section 2.12(d)(iii) below, in the event that any change in\nmarket conditions or any Change in Law shall at any time after the date hereof, in the reasonable opinion of any Lender, make it\nunlawful or impractical for such Lender to fund or maintain SOFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to\nAdjusted Term SOFR) or to continue such funding or maintaining, or to determine or charge interest rates at the Term SOFR\nReference Rate, Adjusted Term SOFR, Term SOFR or SOFR, such Lender shall give notice of such changed circumstances to\nAgent and Borrowers and Agent promptly shall transmit the notice to each other Lender and (y)(i) in the case of any SOFR Loans\nof such Lender that are outstanding, such SOFR Loans of such Lender will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans\non the last day of the Interest Period of such SOFR Loans, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans, or\nimmediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans, and thereafter interest upon the SOFR Loans\nof such Lender thereafter shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans (if applicable, without reference to the\nAdjusted Term SOFR component thereof) and (ii) in the case of any such Base Rate Loans of such Lender that are outstanding and\nthat are determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR, interest upon the Base Rate Loans of such Lender after the date\nspecified in such Lender’s notice shall accrue interest at the rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans without reference to the\nAdjusted Term SOFR component thereof and (z) Borrowers shall not be entitled to elect the SOFR Option and Base Rate Loans\nshall not be determined with reference to the Adjusted Term SOFR component thereof, in each case, until such Lender determines\nthat it would no longer be unlawful or impractical to do so.\n(iii)Benchmark Replacement Setting.\n(A) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a\nBenchmark Transition Event, Agent and Administrative Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the then-current Benchmark\nwith a Benchmark Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event will become effective at 5:00 p.m.\non the fifth(5th) Business Day after Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all affected Lenders and Administrative Borrower so\nlong as Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the Required\nLenders. No replacement of a Benchmark with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii)will occur prior to the\napplicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.\n(B) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a\nBenchmark Replacement, Agent, in consultation with Administrative Borrower, will have the right to make Conforming Changes from\ntime to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments\n73\nimplementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this\nAgreement or any other Loan Document.\n(C) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. Agent will promptly notify Administrative Borrower and the Lenders of (1)the\nimplementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (2) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use,\nadministration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. Agent will notify Administrative Borrower of (x) the removal\nor reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.12(d)(iii)(D) and (y) the commencement of any Benchmark\nUnavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of\nLenders) pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence\nor non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be\nconclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to\nthis Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.12(d)(iii).\n(D) Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, at any time\n(including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (1) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate\n(including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (I) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other\ninformation service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by Agent in its reasonable discretion or (II) the regulatory\nsupervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any\ntenor for such Benchmark is not or will not be representative, then Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar\nor analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (2)\nif a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (1) above either (I) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a\nBenchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (II) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be\nrepresentative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or\nany similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.\n(E) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon Administrative Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark\nUnavailability Period, (1) Administrative Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of\nSOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, Administrative\nBorrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans and (2)\nany outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans at the end of the applicable Interest\nPeriod. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available\nTenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will\nnot be used in any determination of the Base Rate.\n(e) No Requirement of Matched Funding. Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, neither\nAgent, nor any Lender, nor any of their Participants, is required actually to match fund any Obligation as to which interest accrues at Adjusted\nTerm SOFR or the Term SOFR Reference Rate.\n74\n2.13 Capital Requirements.\n(a) If, after the date hereof, Issuing Bank or any Lender determines that (i) any Change in Law regarding capital,\nliquidity or reserve requirements for banks or bank holding companies, or (ii) compliance by Issuing Bank or such Lender, or their respective\nparent bank holding companies, with any guideline, request or directive of any Governmental Authority regarding capital adequacy or liquidity\nrequirements (whether or not having the force of law), has the effect of reducing the return on Issuing Bank’s, such Lender’s, or such holding\ncompanies’ capital or liquidity as a consequence of Issuing Bank’s or such Lender’s commitments, Loans, participations or other obligations\nhereunder to a level below that which Issuing Bank, such Lender, or such holding companies could have achieved but for such Change in Law or\ncompliance (taking into consideration Issuing Bank’s, such Lender’s, or such holding companies’ then existing policies with respect to capital\nadequacy or liquidity requirements and assuming the full utilization of such entity’s capital) by any amount deemed by Issuing Bank or such\nLender to be material, then Issuing Bank or such Lender may notify Borrowers and Agent thereof. Following receipt of such notice, Borrowers\nagree to pay Issuing Bank or such Lender on demand the amount of such reduction of return of capital as and when such reduction is determined,\npayable within 30 days after presentation by Issuing Bank or such Lender of a statement in the amount and setting forth in reasonable detail\nIssuing Bank’s or such Lender’s calculation thereof and the assumptions upon which such calculation was based (which statement shall be\ndeemed true and correct absent manifest error). In determining such amount, Issuing Bank or such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and\nattribution methods. Failure or delay on the part of Issuing Bank or any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 shall not\nconstitute a waiver of Issuing Bank’s or such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided, that Borrowers shall not be required to\ncompensate Issuing Bank or a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.13 for any reductions in return incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that\nIssuing Bank or such Lender notifies Borrowers of such Change in Law giving rise to such reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim\ncompensation therefor; provided further, that if such claim arises by reason of the Change in Law that is retroactive, then the 180-day period\nreferred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.\n(b) If Issuing Bank or any Lender requests additional or increased costs referred to in Section 2.11(l) or Section\n2.12(d)(i) or amounts under Section 2.13(a) or sends a notice under Section 2.12(d)(ii) relative to changed circumstances (such Issuing Bank or\nLender, an “Affected Lender”), then, at the request of Administrative Borrower, such Affected Lender shall use reasonable efforts to promptly\ndesignate a different one of its lending offices or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices or branches, if (i) in the\nreasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such designation or assignment would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section\n2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or would eliminate the illegality or impracticality of funding or maintaining SOFR\nLoans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR), and (ii) in the reasonable judgment of such Affected Lender, such\ndesignation or assignment would not subject it to any material unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially\ndisadvantageous to it. Borrowers agree to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by such Affected Lender in connection\nwith any such designation or assignment. If, after such reasonable efforts, such Affected Lender does not so designate a different one of its lending\noffices or assign its rights to another of its offices or branches so as to eliminate Borrowers’ obligation to pay any future amounts to such Affected\nLender pursuant to Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable, or to enable Borrowers to obtain SOFR Loans (or Base\nRate Loans determined with reference to Adjusted Term SOFR), then Borrowers (without prejudice to any amounts then due to such Affected\nLender under Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable) may, unless prior to the effective date of any such assignment\nthe Affected Lender withdraws its request for such additional amounts under Section 2.11(l), Section 2.12(d)(i) or Section 2.13(a), as applicable,\nor indicates that it is no longer unlawful or impractical to fund or maintain SOFR Loans (or Base Rate Loans determined with reference to\nAdjusted Term SOFR),\n75\nmay designate a different Issuing Bank or substitute a Lender or prospective Lender, in each case, reasonably acceptable to Agent to purchase the\nObligations owed to such Affected Lender and such Affected Lender’s commitments hereunder (a “Replacement Lender”), and if such\nReplacement Lender agrees to such purchase, such Affected Lender shall assign to the Replacement Lender its Obligations and commitments, and\nupon such purchase by the Replacement Lender, which such Replacement Lender shall be deemed to be “Issuing Bank” or a “Lender” (as the case\nmay be) for purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Lender shall cease to be “Issuing Bank” or a “Lender” (as the case may be) for\npurposes of this Agreement.\n(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the protection of Sections 2.11(l), 2.12(d), and 2.13 shall be\navailable to Issuing Bank and each Lender (as applicable) regardless of any possible contention of the invalidity or inapplicability of the law,\nrule, regulation, judicial ruling, judgment, guideline, treaty or other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed, so long as it\nshall be customary for issuing banks or lenders affected thereby to comply therewith. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, neither Issuing\nBank nor any Lender shall demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.13 if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of Issuing\nBank or such Lender (as the case may be) to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable provisions of other credit\nagreements, if any.\n2.14 Incremental Facilities.\n(a) At any time during the period from and after the Closing Date through but excluding the date that is the Maturity\nDate, at the option of Borrowers (but subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.14(b) below), the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum\nRevolver Amount may be increased by an amount in the aggregate for all such increases of the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum\nRevolver Amount not to exceed the Available Increase Amount (each such increase, an “Increase”). Agent shall invite each Lender to increase its\nRevolver Commitments (it being understood that no Lender shall be obligated to increase its Revolver Commitments) in connection with a\nproposed Increase at the interest margin proposed by Borrowers, and if sufficient Lenders do not agree to increase their Revolver Commitments in\nconnection with such proposed Increase, then Agent or Borrowers may invite any prospective lender who is reasonably satisfactory to Agent and\nBorrowers to become a Lender in connection with a proposed Increase. Any Increase shall be in an amount of at least $25,000,000 and integral\nmultiples of $5,000,000 in excess thereof. In no event may the Revolver Commitments and the Maximum Revolver Amount be increased\npursuant to this Section 2.14 on more than two occasions in the aggregate for all such Increases. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, it is\nunderstood and agreed that in no event shall the aggregate amount of the Increases to the Revolver Commitments exceed $200,000,000.\n(b) Each of the following shall be conditions precedent to any Increase of the Revolver Commitments and the\nMaximum Revolver Amount in connection therewith:\n(i)Agent or Borrowers have obtained the commitment of one or more Lenders (or other prospective\nlenders) reasonably satisfactory to Agent and Borrowers to provide the applicable Increase and any such Lenders (or prospective\nlenders), Borrowers, and Agent have signed a joinder agreement to this Agreement (an “Increase Joinder”), in form and substance\nreasonably satisfactory to Agent, to which such Lenders (or prospective lenders), Borrowers, and Agent are party,\n(ii)each of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.2 are satisfied,\n76\n(iii)in connection with any Increase, if any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries owns or will acquire\nany Margin Stock, Borrowers shall deliver to Agent an updated Form U-1 (with sufficient additional originals thereof for each\nLender), duly executed and delivered by the Borrowers, together with such other documentation as Agent shall reasonably request,\nin order to enable Agent and the Lenders to comply with any of the requirements under Regulations T, U or X of the Board of\nGovernors,\n(iv)Borrowers have delivered to Agent updated pro forma Projections (after giving effect to the\napplicable Increase) for the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries evidencing compliance on a pro forma basis with Section 7 for the\n12 months (on a month-by-month basis) immediately following the proposed date of the applicable Increase,\n(v)Borrowers have delivered to Agent an officer’s certificate with corresponding calculations\ncertifying and demonstrating that as of the date of such Increase (i) after taking into account all Indebtedness of the Borrowers\nother than the Obligations, the Borrowers are able to incur Indebtedness under this Agreement equal to the Maximum Revolver\nAmount after giving effect to such Increase without violating Section 1011 of the KAC Indentures, and (ii) the Indenture Credit\nFacilities Cap exceeds the sum of (x) the Maximum Revolver Amount after giving effect to such Increase and (y) all Indenture\nCredit Facilities Indebtedness other than the Obligations, by an amount equal to or greater than 10% of the Maximum Revolver\nAmount after giving effect to such Increase; and\n(vi)the interest rate margins with respect to the Revolving Loans to be made pursuant to the increased\nRevolver Commitments shall be the same as the interest rate margin applicable to Revolving Loans hereunder immediately prior to\nthe applicable Increase Date (as defined below).\n(c) Unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this Agreement and any other Loan Document to\nRevolving Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires, to include Revolving Loans made pursuant to the increased Revolver\nCommitments and Maximum Revolver Amount pursuant to this Section 2.14.\n(d) Each of the Lenders having a Revolver Commitment prior to the Increase Date (the “Pre-Increase Revolver\nLenders”) shall assign to any Lender which is acquiring a new or additional Revolver Commitment on the Increase Date (the “Post-Increase\nRevolver Lenders”), and such Post-Increase Revolver Lenders shall purchase from each Pre-Increase Revolver Lender, at the principal amount\nthereof, such interests in the Revolving Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit on such Increase Date as shall be necessary in order\nthat, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans and participation interests in Letters of Credit will be held by\nPre-Increase Revolver Lenders and Post-Increase Revolver Lenders ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Share after giving effect to such\nincreased Revolver Commitments.\n(e) The Revolving Loans, Revolver Commitments, and Maximum Revolver Amount established pursuant to this\nSection 2.14 shall constitute Revolving Loans, Revolver Commitments, and Maximum Revolver Amount under, and shall be entitled to all the\nbenefits afforded by, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and shall, without limiting the foregoing, benefit equally and ratably from\nany guarantees and the security interests created by the Loan Documents. Borrowers shall take any actions reasonably required by Agent to ensure\nand demonstrate that the Liens and security interests granted by the Loan Documents continue to be perfected under the Code or otherwise after\ngiving effect to the establishment of any such new Revolver Commitments and Maximum Revolver Amount.\n77\n2.15 Joint and Several Liability of Borrowers.\n(a) Each Borrower is accepting joint and several liability hereunder and under the other Loan Documents in\nconsideration of the financial accommodations to be provided by the Lender Group under this Agreement, for the mutual benefit, directly and\nindirectly, of each Borrower and in consideration of the undertakings of the other Borrowers to accept joint and several liability for the\nObligations.\n(b) Each Borrower, jointly and severally, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally accepts, not merely as a surety but\nalso as a co-debtor, joint and several liability with the other Borrowers, with respect to the payment and performance of all of the Obligations\n(including any Obligations arising under this Section 2.15), it being the intention of the parties hereto that all the Obligations shall be the joint and\nseveral obligations of each Borrower without preferences or distinction among them. Accordingly, each Borrower hereby waives any and all\nsuretyship defenses that would otherwise be available to such Borrower under applicable law.\n(c) If and to the extent that any Borrower shall fail to make any payment with respect to any of the Obligations as\nand when due, whether upon maturity, acceleration, or otherwise, or to perform any of the Obligations in accordance with the terms thereof, then\nin each such event the other Borrowers will make such payment with respect to, or perform, such Obligations until such time as all of the\nObligations are paid in full, and without the need for demand, protest, or any other notice or formality.\n(d) The Obligations of each Borrower under the provisions of this Section 2.15 constitute the absolute and\nunconditional, full recourse Obligations of each Borrower enforceable against each Borrower to the full extent of its properties and assets,\nirrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement (other than this Section 2.15(d)) or any other\ncircumstances whatsoever.\n(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,\neach Borrower hereby waives presentments, demands for performance, protests and notices, including notices of acceptance of its joint and\nseveral liability, notice of any Revolving Loans, or any Letters of Credit issued under or pursuant to this Agreement, notice of the occurrence of\nany Default, Event of Default, notices of nonperformance, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, notices of acceptance of this Agreement, notices\nof the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional Obligations or other financial accommodations or of any demand for any payment\nunder this Agreement, notice of any action at any time taken or omitted by Agent or Lenders under or in respect of any of the Obligations, any\nright to proceed against any other Borrower or any other Person, to proceed against or exhaust any security held from any other Borrower or any\nother Person, to protect, secure, perfect, or insure any security interest or Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right to take any\naction against any other Borrower, any other Person, or any collateral, to pursue any other remedy in any member of the Lender Group’s or any\nBank Product Provider’s power whatsoever, any requirement of diligence or to mitigate damages and, generally, to the extent permitted by\napplicable law, all demands, notices and other formalities of every kind in connection with this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in this\nAgreement), any right to assert against any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense (legal or equitable), set-off,\ncounterclaim, or claim which each Borrower may now or at any time hereafter have against any other Borrower or any other party liable to any\nmember of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider, any defense, set-off, counterclaim, or claim, of any kind or nature, arising directly or\nindirectly from the present or future lack of perfection, sufficiency, validity, or enforceability of the Obligations or any security therefor, and any\nright or defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by any member of the Lender Group or any Bank\nProduct Provider including any defense based upon an impairment or elimination of such Borrower’s rights of subrogation,\n78\nreimbursement, contribution, or indemnity of such Borrower against any other Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each\nBorrower hereby assents to, and waives notice of, any extension or postponement of the time for the payment of any of the Obligations, the\nacceptance of any payment of any of the Obligations, the acceptance of any partial payment thereon, any waiver, consent or other action or\nacquiescence by Agent or Lenders at any time or times in respect of any default by any Borrower in the performance or satisfaction of any term,\ncovenant, condition or provision of this Agreement, any and all other indulgences whatsoever by Agent or Lenders in respect of any of the\nObligations, and the taking, addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, at any time or times, of any security for any of the Obligations or\nthe addition, substitution or release, in whole or in part, of any Borrower. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Borrower assents\nto any other action or delay in acting or failure to act on the part of any Agent or Lender with respect to the failure by any Borrower to comply\nwith any of its respective Obligations, including any failure strictly or diligently to assert any right or to pursue any remedy or to comply fully\nwith applicable laws or regulations thereunder, which might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.15 afford grounds for terminating,\ndischarging or relieving any Borrower, in whole or in part, from any of its Obligations under this Section 2.15, it being the intention of each\nBorrower that, so long as any of the Obligations hereunder remain unsatisfied, the Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.15 shall not\nbe discharged except by performance and then only to the extent of such performance. The Obligations of each Borrower under this Section 2.15\nshall not be diminished or rendered unenforceable by any winding up, reorganization, arrangement, liquidation, reconstruction or similar\nproceeding with respect to any other Borrower or any Agent or Lender. Each of the Borrowers waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the\nbenefit of any statute of limitations affecting its liability hereunder or the enforcement hereof. Any payment by any Borrower or other\ncircumstance which operates to toll any statute of limitations as to any Borrower shall operate to toll the statute of limitations as to each of the\nBorrowers. Each of the Borrowers waives any defense based on or arising out of any defense of any Borrower or any other Person, other than\npayment of the Obligations to the extent of such payment, based on or arising out of the disability of any Borrower or any other Person, or the\nvalidity, legality, or unenforceability of the Obligations or any part thereof from any cause, or the cessation from any cause of the liability of any\nBorrower other than payment of the Obligations to the extent of such payment. Agent may, at the election of the Required Lenders, foreclose upon\nany Collateral held by Agent by one or more judicial or nonjudicial sales or other dispositions, whether or not every aspect of any such sale is\ncommercially reasonable or otherwise fails to comply with applicable law or may exercise any other right or remedy Agent, any other member of\nthe Lender Group, or any Bank Product Provider may have against any Borrower or any other Person, or any security, in each case, without\naffecting or impairing in any way the liability of any of the Borrowers hereunder except to the extent the Obligations have been paid.\n(f) Each Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower is currently informed of the\nfinancial condition of Borrowers and of all other circumstances which a diligent inquiry would reveal and which bear upon the risk of\nnonpayment of the Obligations. Each Borrower further represents and warrants to Agent and Lenders that such Borrower has read and\nunderstands the terms and conditions of the Loan Documents. Each Borrower hereby covenants that such Borrower will continue to keep\ninformed of Borrowers’ financial condition and of all other circumstances which bear upon the risk of nonpayment or nonperformance of the\nObligations.\n(g) The provisions of this Section 2.15 are made for the benefit of Agent, each member of the Lender Group, each\nBank Product Provider, and their respective successors and assigns, and may be enforced by it or them from time to time against any or all\nBorrowers as often as occasion therefor may arise and without requirement on the part of Agent, any member of the Lender Group, any Bank\nProduct Provider, or any of their successors or assigns first to marshal any of its or their claims or to exercise any of its or their rights against any\nBorrower or to exhaust any remedies available to it or them against any Borrower or to resort to any other source or means of obtaining payment\nof any of the Obligations hereunder or to elect any other remedy. The provisions of this Section 2.15 shall remain in effect until all of the\n79\nObligations shall have been paid in full or otherwise fully satisfied. If at any time, any payment, or any part thereof, made in respect of any of the\nObligations, is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of\nany Borrower, or otherwise, the provisions of this Section 2.15 will forthwith be reinstated in effect, as though such payment had not been made.\n(h) Each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not enforce any of its rights that arise from the existence, payment,\nperformance or enforcement of the provisions of this Section 2.15, including rights of subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or\nindemnification and any right to participate in any claim or remedy of Agent, any other member of the Lender Group, or any Bank Product\nProvider against any Borrower, whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law, including the\nright to take or receive from any Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other manner, payment or\nsecurity solely on account of such claim, remedy or right, unless and until such time as all of the Obligations have been paid in full in cash. Any\nclaim which any Borrower may have against any other Borrower with respect to any payments to any Agent or any member of the Lender Group\nhereunder or under any of the Bank Product Agreements are hereby expressly made subordinate and junior in right of payment, without limitation\nas to any increases in the Obligations arising hereunder or thereunder, to the prior payment in full in cash of the Obligations and, in the event of\nany insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar proceeding under the laws of any jurisdiction relating to any\nBorrower, its debts or its assets, whether voluntary or involuntary, all such Obligations shall be paid in full in cash before any payment or\ndistribution of any character, whether in cash, securities or other property, shall be made to any other Borrower therefor. If any amount shall be\npaid to any Borrower in violation of the immediately preceding sentence, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of Agent, for the\nbenefit of the Lender Group and the Bank Product Providers, and shall forthwith be paid to Agent to be credited and applied to the Obligations\nand all other amounts payable under this Agreement, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, or to be held\nas Collateral for any Obligations or other amounts payable under this Agreement thereafter arising. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary\ncontained in this Agreement, no Borrower may exercise any rights of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar rights\nagainst, and may not proceed or seek recourse against or with respect to any property or asset of, any other Borrower (the “Foreclosed\nBorrower”), including after payment in full of the Obligations, if all or any portion of the Obligations have been satisfied in connection with an\nexercise of remedies in respect of the Equity Interests of such Foreclosed Borrower whether pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.\n(i) Each of the Borrowers hereby acknowledges and affirms that it understands that to the extent the Obligations are\nsecured by Real Property located in California, the Borrowers shall be liable for the full amount of the liability hereunder notwithstanding the\nforeclosure on such Real Property by trustee sale or any other reason impairing such Borrower’s right to proceed against any other Loan Party. In\naccordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction, each of the Borrowers hereby\nwaives until such time as the Obligations have been paid in full:\n(i)all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and\ndefenses that are or may become available to the Borrowers by reason of Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive, 2899, and 3433 of the\nCalifornia Civil Code or any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction;\n(ii)all rights and defenses that the Borrowers may have because the Obligations are secured by Real\nProperty located in California, meaning, among other things, that: (A) Agent, the other members of the Lender Group, and the Bank\nProduct Providers may collect from the Borrowers without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral\n80\npledged by any Loan Party, and (B) if Agent, on behalf of the Lender Group, forecloses on any Real Property pledged as Collateral\nby any Loan Party, (1) the amount of the Obligations may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the\nforeclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price, and (2) the Lender Group may collect from the Loan\nParties even if, by foreclosing on any such Real Property pledged as Collateral, Agent or the other members of the Lender Group\nhave destroyed or impaired any right the Borrowers may have to collect from any other Loan Party, it being understood that this is\nan unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses the Borrowers may have because the Obligations are secured by\nReal Property (including any rights or defenses based upon Sections 580a, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure\nor any similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction); and\n(iii)all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Agent, the other members of the\nLender Group, and the Bank Product Providers, even though that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with\nrespect to security for the Obligations, has destroyed the Borrowers’ rights of subrogation and reimbursement against any other\nLoan Party by the operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or any similar laws of any other applicable\njurisdiction or otherwise\n2.16 ESG Amendment; Sustainability Coordinator.\n(a) After the Third Amendment Effective Date, the Borrowers, in consultation with the Sustainability Coordinator,\nshall be entitled, but not required, to either (a) establish specified Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) with respect to certain Environmental,\nSocial and Governance (“ESG”) targets of the Borrowers and their respective Subsidiaries and evaluated by the Sustainability Assurance Provider\nor (b) establish external ESG ratings (“ESG Ratings”) targets to be mutually agreed between the Borrowers and the Sustainability Coordinator and\nreviewed by the Sustainability Assurance Provider. The Sustainability Coordinator, the Borrowers and the Required Lenders may amend this\nAgreement (such amendment, the “ESG Amendment”) solely for the purpose of incorporating either the KPIs or ESG Ratings and other related\nprovisions (the “ESG Pricing Provisions”) into this Agreement. Upon effectiveness of any such ESG Amendment, based on either the Borrower’s\nperformance against the KPIs or its obtainment of the target ESG Ratings, certain adjustments to the Unused Line Fee, Letter of Credit Fee and\nApplicable Margin may be made; provided that the amount of any such adjustments made pursuant to an ESG Amendment shall not result in a\ndecrease or increase of more than (a) 1.50 basis points in the Unused Line Fee and/or (b) 7.50 basis points in the Applicable Margin or Letter of\nCredit Fee. If KPIs are utilized, the pricing adjustments will require, among other things, reporting and validation of the measurement of the KPIs\nin a manner that is aligned with the Sustainability Linked Loan Principles (as published in May 2021 by the Loan Market Association, Asia\nPacific Loan Market Association and Loan Syndications & Trading Association) and is to be mutually agreed between the Borrowers and the\nSustainability Coordinator (each acting reasonably) and reviewed by the Sustainability Assurance Provider. Following the effectiveness of the\nESG Amendment, any modification to the ESG Pricing Provisions which does not have the effect of reducing or increasing the Unused Line Fee,\nLetter of Credit Fee or Applicable Margin to a level not otherwise permitted by this paragraph shall be subject only to the consent of the Required\nLenders.\n(b) The Sustainability Coordinator will (i) assist the Borrowers in determining the ESG Pricing Provisions in\nconnection with the ESG Amendment and (ii) assist the Borrowers in preparing informational materials focused on ESG to be used in connection\nwith the ESG Amendment.\n81\n3. CONDITIONS; TERM OF AGREEMENT.\n3.1 Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness.

No termination of the\nobligations of the Lender Group (other than payment in full of the Obligations and termination of the Commitments) shall relieve or discharge any\nLoan Party of its duties, obligations, or covenants hereunder or under any other Loan Document and Agent’s Liens in the Collateral shall continue\nto secure the Obligations and shall remain in effect until all Obligations have been paid in full. When all of the Obligations have been paid in full,\nAgent will, at Borrowers’ sole expense, execute and deliver any termination statements, lien releases, discharges of security interests, and other\nsimilar discharge or release documents (and, if applicable, in recordable form) as are reasonably necessary to release, as of record, Agent’s Liens\nand all notices of security interests and liens previously filed by Agent.\n3.5 Early Termination by Borrowers.

Other than in connection with an assignment by a Lender of all or any portion of its Revolver Commitments to an Affiliate of such Lender\nor a Related Fund of such Lender (i) a Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be assigned or sold in whole or\nin part only by registration of such assignment or sale on the Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide) and (ii) any assignment\nor sale of all or part of such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be effected only by registration of such\nassignment or sale on the Register, together with the surrender of the registered note, if any, evidencing the same duly endorsed by (or\naccompanied by a written instrument of assignment or sale duly executed by) the holder of such registered note, whereupon, at the request of the\ndesignated assignee(s) or transferee(s), one or more new registered notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be issued to the designated\nassignee(s) or transferee(s). Prior to the registration of assignment or sale of any Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any evidencing the\nsame), Borrowers shall treat the Person in whose name such Registered Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) is registered as\nthe owner thereof for the purpose of receiving all payments thereon and for all other purposes, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In the case\nof any assignment by a Lender of all or any portion of its Revolver Commitments to an Affiliate of such Lender or a Related Fund of such Lender,\nand which assignment is not recorded in the Register, the assigning Lender, on behalf of Borrowers, shall maintain a register comparable to the\nRegister. The Register shall be available for inspection by Administrative Borrower and any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time\nupon reasonable prior notice.\n(i) In the event that a Lender sells participations in the Loans, such Lender, as a non-fiduciary agent on behalf of\nBorrowers, shall maintain (or cause to be maintained) a register on which it enters the name of all participants in the Loans held by it (and the\nprincipal amount (and stated interest thereon) of the portion of such Loans that is subject to such participations) (the “Participant Register”). A\nLoan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing the same) may be participated in whole or in part only by registration of such participation on the\nParticipant Register (and each registered note shall expressly so provide). Any participation of a Loan (and the registered note, if any, evidencing\nthe same) may be effected only by the registration of such participation on the Participant Register. No Lender shall have any obligation to\ndisclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s\ninterest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such\ndisclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c)\nof the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall\ntreat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement\nnotwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for\nmaintaining a Participant Register.\n(j) Agent shall make a copy of the Register (and each Lender shall make a copy of its Participant Register to the\nextent it has one) available for review by Borrowers from time to time as Borrowers may reasonably request.\n116\n13.2 Successors. This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each of the\nparties; provided, that no Borrower may assign this Agreement or any rights or duties hereunder without the Lenders’ prior written consent and\nany prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void ab initio. No consent to assignment by the Lenders shall release any Borrower from its\nObligations. A Lender may assign this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and its rights and duties hereunder and thereunder pursuant to\nSection 13.1 and, except as expressly required pursuant to Section 13.1, no consent or approval by any Borrower is required in connection with\nany such assignment.\n14.AMENDMENTS;

Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells Fargo as its agent\nunder this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product\nAgreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to designate, appoint, and authorize) Agent to execute and deliver each of the other Loan\nDocuments on its behalf and to take such other action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to\nexercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document,\ntogether with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent agrees to act as agent for and on behalf of the Lenders (and the Bank\nProduct Providers) on the conditions contained in this Section 15. Any provision to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any\nother Loan Document notwithstanding, Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein or in the other\nLoan Documents, nor shall Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender (or Bank Product Provider), and no\nimplied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or\notherwise exist against Agent. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the term “agent” in this Agreement or the other Loan\nDocuments with reference to Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency\ndoctrine of any applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only a\nrepresentative relationship between independent contracting parties. Each Lender hereby further authorizes (and by entering into a Bank Product\nAgreement, each Bank Product Provider shall be deemed to authorize) Agent to act as the secured party under each of the Loan Documents that\ncreate a Lien on any item of Collateral. Except as expressly otherwise provided in this Agreement, Agent shall have and may use its sole\ndiscretion with respect to exercising or refraining from exercising any discretionary rights or taking or refraining from taking any actions that\nAgent expressly is entitled to take or assert under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of\nthe foregoing, or of any other provision of the Loan Documents that provides rights or powers to Agent, Lenders agree that Agent shall have the\nright to exercise the following powers as long as this Agreement remains in effect: (a) maintain, in accordance with its customary business\npractices, ledgers and records reflecting the status of the Obligations, the Collateral, payments and proceeds of Collateral, and related matters, (b)\nexecute or file any and all financing or similar statements or notices, amendments, renewals, supplements, documents, instruments, proofs of\nclaim, notices and other written agreements with respect to the Loan Documents, or to take any other action with respect to any Collateral or Loan\nDocuments which may be necessary to perfect, and maintain perfected, the security interests and Liens upon Collateral pursuant to the Loan\nDocuments, (c) make Revolving Loans, for itself or on behalf of Lenders, as provided in the Loan Documents, (d) exclusively receive, apply, and\ndistribute payments and proceeds of the Collateral as provided in the Loan Documents, (e) open and maintain such bank accounts and cash\nmanagement arrangements as Agent deems necessary and appropriate in accordance with the Loan Documents for the foregoing purposes, (f)\nperform, exercise, and enforce any and all other rights and remedies of the Lender Group with respect to any Loan Party or its Subsidiaries, the\nObligations, the Collateral, or otherwise related to any of same as provided in the Loan Documents, and (g) incur and pay such Lender Group\nExpenses as Agent may deem necessary or appropriate for the performance and fulfillment of its functions and powers pursuant to the Loan\nDocuments.\n15.2 Delegation of Duties.

All payments made by any Loan Party under any Loan Document will be made free and clear of, and\nwithout deduction or withholding for, any Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable law, and in the event any deduction or withholding of\nTaxes is required, the applicable Loan Party shall make the requisite withholding, promptly pay over to the applicable Governmental Authority the\nwithheld tax, and furnish to Agent as promptly as possible after the date the payment of any such Tax is due pursuant to applicable law, certified\ncopies of tax receipts evidencing such payment by the Loan Parties. Furthermore, if any such Tax is an Indemnified Tax or an Indemnified Tax is\nso levied or imposed, the Loan Parties agree to pay the full amount of such Indemnified Taxes and such additional amounts as may be necessary\nso that every payment of all amounts due under this Agreement, any note, or Loan Document, including any amount paid pursuant to this Section\n16.1 after withholding or deduction for or on account of any Indemnified Taxes, will not be less than the amount provided for herein. The Loan\nParties will promptly pay any Other Taxes or reimburse Agent for such Other Taxes upon Agent’s demand. The Loan Parties shall jointly and\nseverally indemnify Agent, each Lender, and the Issuing Bank (collectively a “Tax Indemnitee”) for the full amount of Indemnified Taxes arising\nin connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or breach thereof by any Loan Party (including any Indemnified Taxes imposed\nor asserted on, or attributable to, amounts payable under this Section 16) imposed on, or paid by, such Tax Indemnitee and all reasonable costs and\nexpenses related thereto (including fees and disbursements of attorneys and other tax professionals), as and when they are incurred and\nirrespective of whether suit is brought, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant\nGovernmental Authority (other than Indemnified Taxes and additional amounts that a court of competent jurisdiction finally determines to have\nresulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Tax Indemnitee). The obligations of the Loan Parties under this Section 16 shall\nsurvive the termination of this Agreement, the resignation and replacement of the Agent, and the repayment of the Obligations.\n16.2 Exemptions.\n129\n(a) If a Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption or reduction from United States withholding tax, such\nLender or Participant agrees with and in favor of Agent, to deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the\nparticipation only) and the Administrative Borrower on behalf of all Borrowers one of the following before receiving its first payment under this\nAgreement:\n(i)if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption from United States withholding tax\npursuant to the portfolio interest exception, (A) a statement of the Lender or Participant, signed under penalty of perjury, that it is\nnot a (I) a “bank” as described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the IRC, (II) a 10% shareholder of any Borrower (within the meaning of\nSection 871(h)(3)(B) of the IRC), or (III) a controlled foreign corporation related to Borrowers within the meaning of Section\n864(d)(4) of the IRC, and (B) a properly completed and executed IRS Form W-8BEN, Form W-8BEN-E or Form W-8IMY (with\nproper attachments as applicable);\n(ii)if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim an exemption from, or a reduction of, withholding\ntax under a United States tax treaty, a properly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8BEN or Form W-8BEN-E, as\napplicable;\n(iii)if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt\nfrom United States withholding tax because it is effectively connected with a United States trade or business of such Lender, a\nproperly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-8ECI;\n(iv)if such Lender or Participant is entitled to claim that interest paid under this Agreement is exempt\nfrom United States withholding tax because such Lender or Participant serves as an intermediary, a properly completed and\nexecuted copy of IRS Form W-8IMY (including a withholding statement and copies of the tax certification documentation for its\nbeneficial owner(s) of the income paid to the intermediary, if required based on its status provided on the Form W-8IMY); or\n(v)a properly completed and executed copy of any other form or forms, including IRS Form W-9, as\nmay be required under the IRC or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, United States\nwithholding or backup withholding tax.\n(b) Each Lender or Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or obsolescence of\nany previously delivered forms and to promptly notify Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting\nthe participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.\n(c) If a Lender or Participant claims an exemption from withholding tax in a jurisdiction other than the United\nStates, such Lender or such Participant agrees with and in favor of Agent and Borrowers, to deliver to Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in\nthe case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) any such form or forms, as may be required under the laws of such\njurisdiction as a condition to exemption from, or reduction of, foreign withholding or backup withholding tax before receiving its first payment\nunder this Agreement, but only if such Lender or such Participant is legally able to deliver such forms, or the providing of or delivery of such\nforms in the Lender’s reasonable judgment would not subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or materially prejudice\nthe legal or commercial position of such Lender (or its Affiliates); provided, further, that nothing in this Section 16.2(c) shall require a Lender or\nParticipant to disclose any information that it deems to be\n130\nconfidential (including its tax returns). Each Lender and each Participant shall provide new forms (or successor forms) upon the expiration or\nobsolescence of any previously delivered forms and to promptly notify Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a Participant, to the\nLender granting the participation only) of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or\nreduction.\n(d) If a Lender or Participant claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax and such Lender or\nParticipant sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender or Participant,\nsuch Lender or Participant agrees to notify Agent and Administrative Borrower (or, in the case of a sale of a participation interest, to the Lender\ngranting the participation only) of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of Obligations of Borrowers to such Lender\nor Participant. To the extent of such percentage amount, Agent and Administrative Borrower will treat such Lender’s or such Participant’s\ndocumentation provided pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) as no longer valid. With respect to such percentage amount, such Participant or\nAssignee may provide new documentation, pursuant to Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c), if applicable. Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be\nentitled to the benefits of this Section 16 with respect to its participation in any portion of the Commitments and the Obligations so long as such\nParticipant complies with the obligations set forth in this Section 16 with respect thereto.\n(e) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax\nimposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable due diligence and reporting requirements of FATCA (including\nthose contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the IRC, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the\nLender granting the participation only) at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by Agent (or, in the\ncase of a Participant, the Lender granting the participation) such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section\n1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the IRC) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the Lender\ngranting the participation) as may be necessary for Agent or Borrowers to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such\nLender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely\nfor purposes of this Section 16.2(e), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.\n16.3 Reductions.\n(a) If a Lender or a Participant is subject to an applicable withholding tax, Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, the\nLender granting the participation) may withhold from any payment to such Lender or such Participant an amount equivalent to the applicable\nwithholding tax. If the forms or other documentation required by Section 16.2(a) or 16.2(c) are not delivered to Agent (or, in the case of a\nParticipant, to the Lender granting the participation), then Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) may\nwithhold from any payment to such Lender or such Participant not providing such forms or other documentation an amount equivalent to the\napplicable withholding tax.\n(b) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that\nAgent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation) did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the\naccount of any Lender or any Participant due to a failure on the part of the Lender or any Participant (because the appropriate form was not\ndelivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify Agent (or such Participant failed to notify the Lender granting the\nparticipation) of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other\nreason) such Lender shall indemnify and hold Agent harmless (or, in the case of a Participant, such Participant shall indemnify and\n131\nhold the Lender granting the participation harmless) for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the\nLender granting the participation), as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the\namounts payable to Agent (or, in the case of a Participant, to the Lender granting the participation only) under this Section 16, together with all\ncosts and expenses (including attorneys’ fees and expenses). The obligation of the Lenders and the Participants under this subsection shall survive\nthe payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of Agent.\n16.4 Refunds. If Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes\nto which the Loan Parties have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 16, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is\ncontinuing, it shall pay over such refund to the Administrative Borrower on behalf of the Loan Parties (but only to the extent of payments made,\nor additional amounts paid, by the Loan Parties under this Section 16 with respect to Indemnified Taxes giving rise to such a refund), net of all\nout-of-pocket expenses of Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the applicable Governmental Authority with\nrespect to such a refund); provided, that the Loan Parties, upon the request of Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the\nLoan Parties (plus any penalties, interest or other charges, imposed by the applicable Governmental Authority, other than such penalties, interest\nor other charges imposed as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Agent or Lender hereunder as finally determined by a court\nof competent jurisdiction) to Agent or such Lender in the event Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental\nAuthority. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Section 16 shall not be construed to require Agent or any Lender to\nmake available its tax returns (or any other information which it deems confidential) to Loan Parties or any other Person or require Agent or any\nLender to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to Section 16.4, the payment of which would place Agent or such Lender (or their\nAffiliates) in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Person would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to\nsuch refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such\nTax had never been paid.\n17.GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n17.1 Effectiveness. This Agreement shall be binding and deemed effective when executed by each Borrower, Agent, and\neach Lender whose signature is provided for on the signature pages hereof.\n17.2 Section Headings. Headings and numbers have been set forth herein for convenience only. Unless the contrary is\ncompelled by the context, everything contained in each Section applies equally to this entire Agreement.\n17.3 Interpretation. Neither this Agreement nor any uncertainty or ambiguity herein shall be construed against the Lender\nGroup or any Borrower, whether under any rule of construction or otherwise. On the contrary, this Agreement has been reviewed by all parties and\nshall be construed and interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the words used so as to accomplish fairly the purposes and intentions of\nall parties hereto.\n17.4 Severability of Provisions. Each provision of this Agreement shall be severable from every other provision of this\nAgreement for the purpose of determining the legal enforceability of any specific provision.\n17.5 Bank Product Providers. Each Bank Product Provider in its capacity as such shall be deemed a third party beneficiary\nhereof and of the provisions of the other Loan Documents for purposes\n132\nof any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom Agent is acting. Agent hereby agrees to act as agent for such Bank Product\nProviders and, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, the applicable Bank Product Provider shall be automatically deemed to have\nappointed Agent as its agent and to have accepted the benefits of the Loan Documents. It is understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of\neach Bank Product Provider under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Bank Product Provider’s being a beneficiary of the Liens and\nsecurity interests (and, if applicable, guarantees) granted to Agent and the right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral as more\nfully set forth herein. In addition, each Bank Product Provider, by virtue of entering into a Bank Product Agreement, shall be automatically\ndeemed to have agreed that Agent shall have the right, but shall have no obligation, to establish, maintain, relax, or release reserves in respect of\nthe Bank Product Obligations and that if reserves are established there is no obligation on the part of Agent to determine or insure whether the\namount of any such reserve is appropriate or not. In connection with any such distribution of payments or proceeds of Collateral, Agent shall be\nentitled to assume no amounts are due or owing to any Bank Product Provider unless such Bank Product Provider has provided a written\ncertification (setting forth a reasonably detailed calculation) to Agent as to the amounts that are due and owing to it and such written certification\nis received by Agent a reasonable period of time prior to the making of such distribution. Agent shall have no obligation to calculate the amount\ndue and payable with respect to any Bank Products, but may rely upon the written certification of the amount due and payable from the applicable\nBank Product Provider. In the absence of an updated certification, Agent shall be entitled to assume that the amount due and payable to the\napplicable Bank Product Provider is the amount last certified to Agent by such Bank Product Provider as being due and payable (less any\ndistributions made to such Bank Product Provider on account thereof). Borrowers may obtain Bank Products from any Bank Product Provider,\nalthough Borrowers are not required to do so. Each Borrower acknowledges and agrees that no Bank Product Provider has committed to provide\nany Bank Products and that the providing of Bank Products by any Bank Product Provider is in the sole and absolute discretion of such Bank\nProduct Provider. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, no provider or holder of any Bank\nProduct shall have any voting or approval rights hereunder (or be deemed a Lender) solely by virtue of its status as the provider or holder of such\nagreements or products or the Obligations owing thereunder, nor shall the consent of any such provider or holder be required (other than in their\ncapacities as Lenders, to the extent applicable) for any matter hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, including as to any matter\nrelating to the Collateral or the release of Collateral or Guarantors.\n17.6 Debtor-Creditor Relationship. The relationship between the Lenders and Agent, on the one hand, and the Loan\nParties, on the other hand, is solely that of creditor and debtor. No member of the Lender Group has (or shall be deemed to have) any fiduciary\nrelationship or duty to any Loan Party arising out of or in connection with the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated thereby, and\nthere is no agency or joint venture relationship between the members of the Lender Group, on the one hand, and the Loan Parties, on the other\nhand, by virtue of any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated therein.\n17.7 Counterparts; Electronic Execution. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by\ndifferent parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered, shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when\ntaken together, shall constitute but one and the same Agreement. Execution of any such counterpart may be by means of (a) an electronic\nsignature that complies with the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, as in effect from time to time, state\nenactments of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, as in effect from time to time, or any other relevant and applicable electronic signatures\nlaw; (b) an original manual signature; or (c) a faxed, scanned, or photocopied manual signature. Each electronic signature or faxed, scanned, or\nphotocopied manual signature shall for all purposes have the same validity, legal effect, and admissibility in evidence as an original manual\nsignature. Agent reserves the right, in its discretion, to accept, deny, or condition acceptance of any electronic signature on this Agreement. Any\nparty delivering an executed\n133\ncounterpart of this Agreement by faxed, scanned or photocopied manual signature shall also deliver an original manually executed counterpart,\nbut the failure to deliver an original manually executed counterpart shall not affect the validity, enforceability and binding effect of this\nAgreement. The foregoing shall apply to each other Loan Document, and any notice delivered hereunder or thereunder, mutatis mutandis.\n17.8 Revival and Reinstatement of Obligations; Certain Waivers.\n(a) If any member of the Lender Group or any Bank Product Provider repays, refunds, restores, or returns in whole\nor in part, any payment or property (including any proceeds of Collateral) previously paid or transferred to such member of the Lender Group or\nsuch Bank Product Provider in full or partial satisfaction of any Obligation or on account of any other obligation of any Loan Party under any\nLoan Document or any Bank Product Agreement, because the payment, transfer, or the incurrence of the obligation so satisfied is asserted or\ndeclared to be void, voidable, or otherwise recoverable under any law relating to creditors’ rights, including provisions of the Bankruptcy Code\nrelating to fraudulent transfers, preferences, or other voidable or recoverable obligations or transfers (each, a “Voidable Transfer”), or because\nsuch member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to do so on the reasonable advice of its counsel in connection with a claim that\nthe payment, transfer, or incurrence is or may be a Voidable Transfer, then, as to any such Voidable Transfer, or the amount thereof that such\nmember of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider elects to repay, restore, or return (including pursuant to a settlement of any claim in\nrespect thereof), and as to all reasonable costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees of such member of the Lender Group or Bank Product Provider\nrelated thereto, (i) the liability of the Loan Parties with respect to the amount or property paid, refunded, restored, or returned will automatically\nand immediately be revived, reinstated, and restored and will exist, and (ii) Agent’s Liens securing such liability shall be effective, revived, and\nremain in full force and effect, in each case, as fully as if such Voidable Transfer had never been made. If, prior to any of the foregoing, (A)\nAgent’s Liens shall have been released or terminated, or (B) any provision of this Agreement shall have been terminated or cancelled, Agent’s\nLiens, or such provision of this Agreement, shall be reinstated in full force and effect and such prior release, termination, cancellation or surrender\nshall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligation of any Loan Party in respect of such liability or any Collateral\nsecuring such liability. This provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the repayment in full of the Obligations.\n(b) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, if Agent or any Lender accepts a guaranty of only a\nportion of the Obligations pursuant to any guaranty, each Borrower hereby waives its right under Section 2822(a) of the California Civil Code or\nany similar laws of any other applicable jurisdiction to designate the portion of the Obligations satisfied by the applicable guarantor’s partial\npayment.\n17.9 Confidentiality.\n(a) Agent and Lenders each individually (and not jointly or jointly and severally) agree that material, non-public\ninformation regarding the Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries, their operations, assets, and existing and contemplated business plans\n(“Confidential Information”) shall be treated by Agent and the Lenders in a confidential manner, and shall not be disclosed by Agent and the\nLenders to Persons who are not parties to this Agreement, except: (i) to attorneys for and other advisors, accountants, auditors, and consultants to\nany member of the Lender Group and to employees, directors and officers of any member of the Lender Group (the Persons in this clause (i),\n“Lender Group Representatives”) on a “need to know” basis in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and on\na confidential basis, (ii) to Subsidiaries and Affiliates of any member of the Lender Group (including the Bank Product Providers); provided, that\nany such Subsidiary or Affiliate shall have agreed to receive such information hereunder subject to the terms of this Section 17.9, (iii) as may be\n134\nrequired by regulatory authorities so long as such authorities are informed of the confidential nature of such information, (iv) as may be required\nby statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation; provided, that (x) prior to any disclosure under this clause (iv), the\ndisclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior notice thereof, to the extent that it is practicable to do so and to the extent that the\ndisclosing party is permitted to provide such prior notice to Borrowers pursuant to the terms of the applicable statute, decision, or judicial or\nadministrative order, rule, or regulation and (y) any disclosure under this clause (iv) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential Information\nas may be required by such statute, decision, or judicial or administrative order, rule, or regulation, (v) as may be agreed to in advance in writing\nby Borrowers, (vi) as requested or required by any Governmental Authority pursuant to any subpoena or other legal process; provided, that (x)\nprior to any disclosure under this clause (vi) the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior written notice thereof, to the extent that it\nis practicable to do so and to the extent that the disclosing party is permitted to provide such prior written notice to Borrowers pursuant to the\nterms of the subpoena or other legal process and (y) any disclosure under this clause (vi) shall be limited to the portion of the Confidential\nInformation as may be required by such Governmental Authority pursuant to such subpoena or other legal process, (vii) as to any such\ninformation that is or becomes generally available to the public (other than as a result of prohibited disclosure by Agent or the Lenders or the\nLender Group Representatives), (viii) in connection with (A) any assignment, participation or pledge of any Lender’s interest under this\nAgreement or (B) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrowers and their\nobligations; provided, that prior to receipt of Confidential Information any such assignee, participant, pledgee, or actual or prospective\ncounterparty (or such actual or prospective counterparty’s advisors) shall have agreed in writing to receive such Confidential Information either\nsubject to the terms of this Section 17.9 or pursuant to confidentiality requirements substantially similar to those contained in this Section 17.9\n(and such Person may disclose such Confidential Information to Persons employed or engaged by them as described in clause (i) above), (ix) in\nconnection with any litigation or other adversary proceeding involving parties hereto which such litigation or adversary proceeding involves\nclaims related to the rights or duties of such parties under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents; provided, that prior to any disclosure to\nany Person (other than any Loan Party, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective counsel) under this clause (ix) with\nrespect to litigation involving any Person (other than any Borrower, Agent, any Lender, any of their respective Affiliates, or their respective\ncounsel), the disclosing party agrees to provide Borrowers with prior written notice thereof, and (x) in connection with, and to the extent\nreasonably necessary for, the exercise of any secured creditor remedy under this Agreement or under any other Loan Document.\n(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Agent may disclose information concerning the\nterms and conditions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to loan syndication and pricing reporting services or in its marketing or\npromotional materials, with such information to consist of deal terms and other information customarily found in such publications or marketing\nor promotional materials and may otherwise use the name, logos, and other insignia of any Borrower or the other Loan Parties and the\nCommitments provided hereunder in any “tombstone” or other advertisements, on its website or in other marketing materials of the Agent.\n(c) Each Loan Party agrees that Agent may make materials or information provided by or on behalf of Borrowers\nhereunder (collectively, “Borrower Materials”) available to the Lenders by posting the Communications on IntraLinks, SyndTrak or a\nsubstantially similar secure electronic transmission system (the “Platform”). The Platform is provided “as is” and “as available.” Agent does not\nwarrant the accuracy or completeness of the Borrower Materials, or the adequacy of the Platform and expressly disclaim liability for errors or\nomissions in the communications. No warranty of any kind, express, implied or statutory, including any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a\nparticular purpose, non-infringement of third party rights or freedom from viruses or other code defects, is made by Agent in connection with the\nBorrower Materials or the Platform. In no event shall Agent or any of the Agent-Related\n135\nPersons have any liability to the Loan Parties, any Lender or any other person for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special,\nincidental or consequential damages, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of any Loan Party’s or Agent’s\ntransmission of communications through the Internet, except to the extent the liability of such person is found in a final non-appealable judgment\nby a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such person’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Each Loan Party further agrees\nthat certain of the Lenders may be “public-side” Lenders (i.e., Lenders that do not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to\nthe Loan Parties or their securities) (each, a “Public Lender”). The Loan Parties shall be deemed to have authorized Agent and its Affiliates and\nthe Lenders to treat Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” or otherwise at any time filed with the SEC as not containing any material non-public\ninformation with respect to the Loan Parties or their securities for purposes of United States federal and state securities laws. All Borrower\nMaterials marked “PUBLIC” are permitted to be made available through a portion of the Platform designated as “Public Investor” (or another\nsimilar term). Agent and its Affiliates and the Lenders shall be entitled to treat any Borrower Materials that are not marked “PUBLIC” or that are\nnot at any time filed with the SEC as being suitable only for posting on a portion of the Platform not marked as “Public Investor” (or such other\nsimilar term).\n17.10 Survival. All representations and warranties made by the Loan Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or\nother instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be considered to have been relied\nupon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of\nany Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that Agent, Issuing Bank,\nor any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit\nis extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of, or any accrued interest on, any Loan or any fee or any\nother amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding or unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have\nnot expired or been terminated.\n17.11 Patriot Act; Due Diligence. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the Patriot Act hereby notifies the Loan\nParties that pursuant to the requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each Loan Party,\nwhich information includes the name and address of each Loan Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify each Loan\nParty in accordance with the Patriot Act. In addition, Agent and each Lender shall have the right to periodically conduct due diligence on all Loan\nParties, their senior management and key principals and legal and beneficial owners. Each Loan Party agrees to cooperate in respect of the\nconduct of such due diligence and further agrees that the reasonable costs and charges for any such due diligence by Agent shall constitute Lender\nGroup Expenses hereunder and be for the account of Borrowers.\n17.12 Integration. This Agreement, together with the other Loan Documents, reflects the entire understanding of the parties\nwith respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not be contradicted or qualified by any other agreement, oral or written, before the\ndate hereof. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, all Bank Product Agreements, if any, are independent agreements governed by the\nwritten provisions of such Bank Product Agreements, which will remain in full force and effect, unaffected by any repayment, prepayments,\nacceleration, reduction, increase, or change in the terms of any credit extended hereunder, except as otherwise expressly provided in such Bank\nProduct Agreement.\n17.13 KAC as Agent for Borrowers. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints KAC as the borrowing agent and attorney-\nin-fact for all Borrowers (the “Administrative Borrower”) which appointment shall remain in full force and effect unless and until Agent shall\nhave received prior written notice signed by each Borrower that such appointment has been revoked and that another Borrower has been\nappointed Administrative Borrower. Each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints and authorizes the\n136\nAdministrative Borrower (a) to provide Agent with all notices with respect to Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit obtained for the benefit of\nany Borrower and all other notices and instructions under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and any notice or instruction provided\nby Administrative Borrower shall be deemed to be given by Borrowers hereunder and shall bind each Borrower), (b) to receive notices and\ninstructions from members of the Lender Group (and any notice or instruction provided by any member of the Lender Group to the Administrative\nBorrower in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been given to each Borrower), (c) to enter into Bank Product Provider\nAgreements on behalf of Borrowers and their Subsidiaries, and (d) to take such action as the Administrative Borrower deems appropriate on its\nbehalf to obtain Revolving Loans and Letters of Credit and to exercise such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto to carry out the\npurposes of this Agreement. It is understood that the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral in a combined fashion, as more fully set forth\nherein, is done solely as an accommodation to Borrowers in order to utilize the collective borrowing powers of Borrowers in the most efficient\nand economical manner and at their request, and that Lender Group shall not incur liability to any Borrower as a result hereof. Each Borrower\nexpects to derive benefit, directly or indirectly, from the handling of the Loan Account and the Collateral in a combined fashion since the\nsuccessful operation of each Borrower is dependent on the continued successful performance of the integrated group. To induce the Lender Group\nto do so, and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby jointly and severally agrees to indemnify each member of the Lender Group and hold\neach member of the Lender Group harmless against any and all liability, expense, loss or claim of damage or injury, made against the Lender\nGroup by any Borrower or by any third party whosoever, arising from or incurred by reason of (i) the handling of the Loan Account and Collateral\nof Borrowers as herein provided, or (ii) the Lender Group’s relying on any instructions of the Administrative Borrower, except that Borrowers\nwill have no liability to the relevant Agent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person under this Section 17.13 with respect to any liability that has\nbeen finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such\nAgent-Related Person or Lender-Related Person, as the case may be.\n17.14 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the\ncontrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto\nacknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured,\nmay be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges\nand agrees to be bound by:\n(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such\nliabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and\n(b) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:\n(i)a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;\n(ii)a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in\nsuch Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on\nit, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such\nliability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or\n(iii)the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and\nconversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.\n137\n17.15 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support,\nthrough a guarantee or otherwise, for Hedge Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC Credit Support”\nand each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer\nProtection Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC\nand QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be\nstated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States): In the event a\nCovered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution\nRegime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such\nSupported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such\nCovered Party will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported\nQFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a\nstate of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.\nSpecial Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit\nSupport that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be\nexercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United\nStates or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties with\nrespect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit\nSupport.\n17.16 Erroneous Payments.\n(a) Each Lender, each Issuing Bank, each other Bank Product Provider and any other party hereto hereby severally\nagrees that if (i) Agent notifies (which such notice shall be conclusive absent manifest error) such Lender or Issuing Bank or any Bank Product\nProvider (or the Lender which is an Affiliate of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Bank Product Provider) or any other Person that has received funds\nfrom Agent or any of its Affiliates, either for its own account or on behalf of a Lender, Issuing Bank or Bank Product Provider (each such\nrecipient, a “Payment Recipient”) that Agent has determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Payment Recipient were\nerroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Payment\nRecipient) or (ii) any Payment Recipient receives any payment from Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a\ndifferent date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such\npayment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment\nsent by Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, as applicable, or (z) that such Payment Recipient\notherwise becomes aware was transmitted or received in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) then, in each case, an error in payment shall be\npresumed to have been made (any such amounts specified in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 17.16(a), whether received as a payment,\nprepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise; individually and collectively, an “Erroneous Payment”), then, in\neach case, such Payment Recipient is deemed to have knowledge of such error at the time of its receipt of such Erroneous Payment; provided that\nnothing in this Section shall require Agent to provide any of the notices specified in clauses (i) or (ii) above. Each Payment Recipient agrees that it\nshall not assert any right or claim to any Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or\nrecoupment with respect\n138\nto any demand, claim or counterclaim by Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payments, including without limitation waiver of any defense\nbased on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.\n(b) Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Payment Recipient agrees that, in the case of clause\n(a)(ii) above, it shall promptly notify Agent in writing of such occurrence.\n(c) In the case of either clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above, such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property\nof Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of Agent, and upon demand from Agent such Payment\nRecipient shall (or, shall cause any Person who received any portion of an Erroneous Payment on its behalf to), promptly, but in all events no later\nthan one Business Day thereafter, return to Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was\nmade in same day funds and in the currency so received, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such\nErroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to Agent at the greater of the\nFederal Funds Rate and a rate determined by Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in\neffect.\n(d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by Agent for any reason, after\ndemand therefor by Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (c), from any Lender that is a Payment Recipient or an Affiliate of a\nPayment Recipient (such unrecovered amount as to such Lender, an “Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency”), then at the sole discretion of Agent\nand upon Agent’s written notice to such Lender (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have made a cashless assignment of the full face amount of the\nportion of its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made (the “Erroneous Payment Impacted\nLoans”) to Agent or, at the option of Agent, Agent’s applicable lending affiliate (such assignee, the “Agent Assignee”) in an amount that is equal\nto the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments)\nof the Erroneous Payment Impacted Loans, the “Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment”) plus any accrued and unpaid interest on such\nassigned amount, without further consent or approval of any party hereto and without any payment by Agent Assignee as the assignee of such\nErroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. Without limitation of its rights hereunder, following the effectiveness of the Erroneous Payment\nDeficiency Assignment, Agent may make a cashless reassignment to the applicable assigning Lender of any Erroneous Payment Deficiency\nAssignment at any time by written notice to the applicable assigning Lender and upon such reassignment all of the Loans assigned pursuant to\nsuch Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be reassigned to such Lender without any requirement for payment or other consideration.\nThe parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (1) any assignment contemplated in this clause (d) shall be made without any requirement for any\npayment or other consideration paid by the applicable assignee or received by the assignor, (2) the provisions of this clause (d) shall govern in the\nevent of any conflict with the terms and conditions of Section 13 and (3) Agent may reflect such assignments in the Register without further\nconsent or action by any other Person.\n(e) Each party hereto hereby agrees that (x) in the event an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered\nfrom any Payment Recipient that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, Agent (1) shall be subrogated to all the\nrights of such Payment Recipient and (2) is authorized to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Payment Recipient\nunder any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by Agent to such Payment Recipient from any source, against any amount due to\nAgent under this Section 17.16 or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, (y) the receipt of an Erroneous Payment by a Payment\nRecipient shall not for the purpose of this Agreement be treated as a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or other satisfaction of any\nObligations owed by the Borrowers or any other Loan Party, except,\n139\nin each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of\nfunds received by Agent from the Borrowers or any other Loan Party for the purpose of making for a payment on the Obligations and (z) to the\nextent that an Erroneous Payment was in any way or at any time credited as payment or satisfaction of any of the Obligations, the Obligations or\nany part thereof that were so credited, and all rights of the Payment Recipient, as the case may be, shall be reinstated and continue in full force\nand effect as if such payment or satisfaction had never been received.\n(f) Each party’s obligations under this Section 17.16 shall survive the resignation or replacement of Agent or any\ntransfer of right or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge\nof all Obligations (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.\n(g) The provisions of this Section 17.16 to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) nothing in this Section 17.16 will\nconstitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from any Payment Recipient’s receipt of an Erroneous Payment and (ii)\nthere will only be deemed to be a recovery of the Erroneous Payment to the extent that Agent has received payment from the Payment Recipient\nin immediately available funds the Erroneous Payment Return, whether directly from the Payment Recipient, as a result of the exercise by Agent\nof its rights of subrogation or set off as set forth above in clause (e) or as a result of the receipt by Agent Assignee of a payment of the outstanding\nprincipal balance of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, but excluding any other\namounts in respect thereof (it being agreed that any payments of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts (other than principal) received by Agent\nAssignee in respect of the Loans assigned to Agent Assignee pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment shall be the sole property\nof Agent Assignee and shall not constitute a recovery of the Erroneous Payment).\n[Signature pages to follow.]\n140\nIN WITNESS

For a summary of specific risk factors that\ncould cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements, please refer to the company’s\nreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s most recent Forms 10-Q and 10–K. All\ninformation in this presentation is as of the date of the presentation. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-\nlooking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in the company’s expectations except as may be\nrequired by law.\n2\nNON-RUN-RATE ITEMS\nNon-run-rate items to us are items that, while they may recur from period to period, (1) are particularly material to results, (2)\nimpact costs as a result of external market factors and (3) may not recur in future periods if the same level of underlying\nperformance were to occur. These are part of our business and operating environment but are worthy of being highlighted for the\nbenefit of the users of our financial statements.\nFurther, presentations including such terms as net income, operating income, or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and\namortization (“EBITDA”) “before non-run-rate”, “after adjustments” or “adjusted”, are not intended to be (and should not be relied\non) in lieu of the comparable caption under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) to which it is reconciled. Such\npresentations are solely intended to provide greater clarity of the impact of certain material items on the GAAP measure and are\nnot intended to imply such items should be excluded.\n3\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis information contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” is defined as a numerical\nmeasure of a company’s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly\ncomparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets or\nstatements of cash flow of the company. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, the Company has provided a reconciliation\nof non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measure in the accompanying tables.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used within this presentation are Conversion Revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Operating\nIncome excluding non-run-rate items, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Net Income per diluted share, excluding non-run-rate items\nand ratios related thereto. These measures are presented because management uses this information to monitor and evaluate\nfinancial results and trends and believes this information to also be useful for investors. Reconciliations of certain forward looking\nnon-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures are not provided because certain items required for such\nreconciliations are outside of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted or provided without unreasonable effort.\n4\nCOMMONLY USED OR DEFINED TERMS AND MEASURES\nTerm/Measure Description\nAdjusted EPS Reported net income per diluted share excluding non-run-rate items.\nAdjusted Net Income Reported net income excluding non-run-rate items.\nAnnualized Quarterly Average Calculated as the four-quarter average for prior years and YTD average for current year.\nConversion Revenue Net sales less the Hedged Cost of Alloyed Metal.\nConversion Revenue ($/lb.) Calculated as Conversion Revenue divided by total shipment pounds.\nEBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA Consolidated Operating Income before non-run-rate plus Depreciation and Amortization.\nEBITDA Margin or Adjusted EBITDA Margin EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Conversion Revenue.\nEPS Reported net income per diluted share.\nHedged Cost of Alloyed Metal Calculated as the Midwest transaction price of aluminum plus the price of alloying elements plus any realized gains and/or losses on settled hedges related to metal sold in the\nreferenced period.\nLTM Last twelve months ended September 30, 2024.\nNet Debt Leverage Ratio Calculated as Long-term debt less Cash and cash equivalents, divided by the LTM Adjusted EBITDA.\nNon-Operating NRR Items Represents the non-service-cost component of the net periodic benefit cost relating to the Salaried VEBA, debt refinancing charges, gains (losses) recorded from the sale of land,\nand gains recorded from business interruption insurance recoveries. These items are excluded from reported Operating income (loss) as they do not contribute to our on-going\noperational results.\nNRR Represents non-run-rate items relating to on-going operations. NRR items are presented on a pre-tax basis.\nOther Applications Includes custom industrial products and billet.\nAdditional Notes\nTotals in the attached presentation may not sum due to rounding.\nWarrick operations were acquired on March 31, 2021. As a result, our financial information reflects 9 months of Packaging operational results for 2021.\nAnnual Conversion Revenue for 2020 inclusive of ~$15 million related to modifications to 2020 customer declarations.\n5\nQ3 2024 HIGHLIGHTS\nKEITH A.

Underlying demand\ncontinued to strengthen during the quarter.\n• Net sales for general engineering applications were $151 million, and conversion revenue was $76\nmillion, reflecting a modest year-over-year increase on a 5% increase in shipments as pricing remained\nrelatively stable despite uneven demand and import pressures.\n• Net sales for automotive extrusions were $62 million, and conversion revenue was $29 million,\nreflecting a 3% increase driven by improved pricing and product mix.\nReported net income for the third quarter 2024 was $12 million, or $0.74 income per diluted share, compared to net\nincome and income per diluted share of $5 million and $0.34, respectively, in the prior year period. Excluding the\nimpact of a pre-tax, non-run-rate charge of $4 million and a non-operating, non-run-rate gain of $9 million, adjusted\nnet income was $8 million for the third quarter 2024, compared to adjusted net income of $7 million in the prior\nyear period. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.51 for the third quarter 2024, compared to adjusted net\nincome per diluted share of $0.46 for the third quarter 2023.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $50 million in the third quarter 2024 increased $2 million compared to the prior year period.\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of conversion revenue was 13.9% in the third quarter 2024 compared to 13.3%\nin the prior year period. The increase in adjusted EBITDA and margin for the third quarter 2024 was driven\nprimarily by an increase in conversion revenue, partially offset by an increase in energy costs and a higher GAAP\nLIFO charge.\nCash Flow and Liquidity\nAdjusted EBITDA of $166 million reported in the first nine months of 2024 and cash on hand funded $47 million\nof working capital, $125 million of capital investments, $31 million of interest payments and $38 million of cash\nreturned to stockholders through quarterly dividends.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $46 million and borrowing availability\nunder the Company's revolving credit facility of $549 million, providing total liquidity of $595 million. There were\nno outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024.\nOn October 15, 2024, the Company announced the declaration of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.77 per share,\nwhich will be paid on November 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 25, 2024.\n2024 Outlook\nThe Company expects demand to be consistent with its previous expectations for the balance of 2024. In\naerospace/high strength applications, the Company remains cautious on its near-term outlook due to the timing of\ncertain customer commercial and labor negotiations which may have a short-term impact on demand and shipments.\nIn the packaging end market, industry momentum and performance improvements at the Company’s Warrick\nfacility are expected to continue as it nears the completion of its fourth coating line investment, which will drive\nmargin improvement starting in 2025. In general engineering, destocking within the Company’s long products has\nconcluded with shipment levels now in better alignment with end market demand. In automotive extrusions, the\nCompany is maintaining a positive outlook as production for light and heavy truck and sport utility vehicle\nplatforms has outpaced broader automotive production rates.\nAccordingly, for the full year 2024, the Company continues to expect overall conversion revenue to remain stable\nwith growth up to 1% compared to 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin, less the full year impact from GAAP LIFO\ncharges, is expected to improve 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2023, as it continues to implement cost\nreduction measures in its operations, increase manufacturing efficiencies and execute its strategic growth\ninitiatives.\nConference Call\nKaiser Aluminum Corporation will host a conference call on Thursday, October 24, 2024, at 10:00 am (Eastern\nTime); 9:00 am (Central Time); 7:00 am (Pacific Time), to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.
