We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.\nAGREEMENT - This document, along with any other documents we give you pertaining to your account(s), is a contract (also referred to as\n“this agreement”) that establishes rules which control your account(s) with us. Please read this carefully and retain it for future reference. If\nyou open the account (whether in-person, electronically, or by any other method permitted by us) or continue to use the account after\nreceiving a notice of change or amendment, you agree to these rules. You will receive a separate schedule of rates, qualifying balances,\nand fees if they are not included in this agreement. If you have any questions, please ask us.\nThis agreement is subject to applicable federal laws, the laws of the state of New York and other applicable rules such as the operating\nletters of the Federal Reserve Banks and payment processing system rules (except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary\nsuch rules or laws). The body of state and federal law that governs our relationship with you, however, is too large and complex to be\nreproduced here. The purpose of this agreement is to:\n(1) summarize some laws that apply to common transactions;\n(2) establish rules to cover transactions or events which the law does not regulate;\n(3) establish rules for certain transactions or events which the law regulates but permits variation by agreement; and\n(4) give you disclosures of some of our policies to which you may be entitled or in which you may be interested.\nIf any provision of this agreement is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and\neffect. We may permit some variations from our standard agreement, but we must agree to any variation in writing either on the signature\ncard for your account or in some other document. Nothing in this agreement is intended to vary our duty to act in good faith and with\nordinary care when required by law.\nAs used in this agreement the words “we,” “our,” and “us” mean the financial institution and the words “you” and “your” mean the account\nholder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over the funds in the account. However, this\nagreement does not intend, and the terms “you” and “your” should not be interpreted, to expand an individual’s responsibility for an\norganization’s liability. If this account is owned by a corporation, partnership or other organization, individual liability is determined by the\nlaws generally applicable to that type of organization. The headings in this agreement are for convenience or reference only and will not\ngovern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this agreement should be\nconstrued so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.\nARBITRATION - Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any alleged breach thereof, shall be resolved by final and\nbinding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be\nconducted in the state of New York by a single arbitrator who is experienced in banking law and agreed upon by the parties. A judgment\nbased upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nLIABILITY - You agree, for yourself (and the person or entity you represent if you sign as a representative of another) to the terms of this\naccount and the schedule of charges. You authorize us to deduct these charges, without notice to you, directly from the account balance as\naccrued. You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this agreement.\nEach of you also agrees to be jointly and severally (individually) liable for any account shortage resulting from charges or overdrafts,\nwhether caused by you or another with access to this account. This liability is due immediately, and we can deduct any amounts deposited\ninto the account and apply those amounts to the shortage. You have no right to defer payment of this liability, and you are liable regardless\nof whether you signed the item or benefited from the charge or overdraft.\nYou will be liable for our costs as well as for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by law, whether incurred as a result of\ncollection or in any other dispute involving your account. This includes, but is not limited to, disputes between you and another joint owner;\nyou and an authorized signer or similar party; or a third party claiming an interest in your account. This also includes any action that you or a\nthird party takes regarding the account that causes us, in good faith, to seek the advice of an attorney, whether or not we become involved\nin the dispute. All costs and attorneys’ fees can be deducted from your account when they are incurred, without notice to you.\nDEPOSITS - We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items, other than cash, we accept for deposit (including items\ndrawn “on us”). Before settlement of any item becomes final, we act only as your agent, regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of\nindorsement on the item and even though we provide you provisional credit for the item. We may reverse any provisional credit for items\nthat are lost, stolen, or returned. Unless prohibited by law, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item\ndeposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to an allegedly\nforged, unauthorized or missing indorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error, counterfeit cashier’s check or other problem which in our\njudgment justifies reversal of credit. You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in\nattempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond the midnight deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in,\nforeign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We are not responsible for transactions by mail or\noutside depository until we actually record them. If you deliver a deposit to us and you will not be present when the deposit is counted, you\nmust provide us an itemized list of the deposit (deposit slip). To process the deposit, we will verify and record the deposit, and credit the\ndeposit to the account. If there are any discrepancies between the amounts shown on the itemized list of the deposit and the amount we\ndetermine to be the actual deposit, we will notify you of the discrepancy. You will be entitled to credit only for the actual deposit as\ndetermined by us, regardless of what is stated on the itemized deposit slip. We will treat and record all transactions received after our “daily\ncutoff time” on a business day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next business day that\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB 6/1/2022 9a,8d Custom TCM-35ac,2bm,3q 202210366-010 Page 2 of 25\nwe are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit. If we accept a third-party check or draft for deposit,\nwe may require any third-party indorsers to verify or guarantee their indorsements, or indorse in our presence.\nWITHDRAWALS -\nImportant terms for accounts where more than one person can withdraw - Unless clearly indicated otherwise on the account records,\nany of you, acting alone, who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals may withdraw or transfer all or any part of the\naccount balance at any time. Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has\nauthority to make withdrawals to indorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to this account or any other transaction with us.\nPostdated checks - A postdated check is one which bears a date later than the date on which the check is written. We may properly pay\nand charge your account for a postdated check even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless we have received\nwritten notice of the postdating in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act. Because we process checks mechanically, your notice will\nnot be effective and we will not be liable for failing to honor your notice unless it precisely identifies the number, date, amount and payee of\nthe item.\nChecks and withdrawal rules - If you do not purchase your check blanks from us, you must be certain that we approve the check blanks\nyou purchase. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which you attempt on forms not approved by us or by any method we do\nnot specifically permit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which is greater in number than the frequency permitted by our\npolicy, or which is for an amount greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as\nopposed to the date you initiate it) to apply any frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on the account until your identity\nis verified.\nEven if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later. If you violate the stated transaction limitations (if any), in our\ndiscretion we may close your account or reclassify your account as another type of account. If we reclassify your account, your account will\nbe subject to the fees and earnings rules of the new account classification.\nIf we are presented with an item drawn against your account that would be a “substitute check,” as defined by law, but for an error or defect\nin the item introduced in the substitute check creation process, you agree that we may pay such item.\nCash withdrawals - We recommend you take care when making large cash withdrawals because carrying large amounts of cash may pose\na danger to your personal safety. As an alternative to making a large cash withdrawal, you may want to consider a cashier's check or similar\ninstrument. You assume full responsibility of any loss in the event the cash you withdraw is lost, stolen, or destroyed. You agree to hold us\nharmless from any loss you incur as a result of your decision to withdraw funds in the form of cash.\nMultiple signatures, electronic check conversion, and similar transactions - An electronic check conversion transaction is a\ntransaction where a check or similar item is converted into an electronic fund transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfers regulation.\nIn these types of transactions the check or similar item is either removed from circulation (truncated) or given back to you. As a result, we\nhave no opportunity to review the signatures or otherwise examine the original check or item. You agree that, as to these or any items as to\nwhich we have no opportunity to examine the signatures, you waive any requirement of multiple signatures.\nNotice of withdrawal - We reserve the right to require not less than 7 days’ notice in writing before each withdrawal from an interest-\nbearing account, other than a time deposit or demand deposit, or from any other savings deposit as defined by Regulation D. (The law\nrequires us to reserve this right, but it is not our general policy to use it.) Withdrawals from a time account prior to maturity or prior to any\nnotice period may be restricted and may be subject to penalty. See your separately provided notice of penalty for early withdrawal.\nUNDERSTANDING AND AVOIDING OVERDRAFT AND NONSUFFICIENT FUNDS (NSF) POSITIONS -\nDetermining your available balance - We use the “available balance” method to determine whether your account is overdrawn, that is,\nwhether there is enough money in your account to pay for a transaction. Importantly, your “available” balance may not be the same as your\naccount’s “actual” balance. This means an overdraft or an NSF transaction could occur regardless of your account’s actual balance.\nYour account’s actual balance (sometimes called the ledger balance) only includes transactions that have settled up to that point in time,\nthat is, transactions (deposits and payments) that have posted to your account. The actual balance does not include outstanding\ntransactions (such as checks that have not yet cleared and electronic transactions that have been authorized but which are still pending).\nThe balance on your periodic statement is the ledger balance for your account as of the statement date.\nAs the name implies, your available balance is calculated based on the money “available” in your account to make payments. In other\nwords, the available balance takes ACH credit transactions and debit card transactions that have been authorized, but not yet settled, and\nadds or subtracts them from the actual balance. In addition, when calculating your available balance, any “holds” placed on deposits that\nhave not yet cleared are also subtracted from the actual balance. For more information on how holds placed on funds in your account can\nimpact your available balance, read the subsection titled “A temporary debit authorization hold affects your account balance.”\nOverdrafts - You understand that we may, at our discretion, honor withdrawal requests that overdraw your account. However, the fact that\nwe may honor withdrawal requests that overdraw the account balance does not obligate us to do so later. So you can NOT rely on us to pay\noverdrafts on your account regardless of how frequently or under what circumstances we have paid overdrafts on your account in the past.\nWe can change our practice of paying, or not paying, discretionary overdrafts on your account without notice to you. You can ask us if we\nhave other account services that might be available to you where we commit to paying overdrafts under certain circumstances, such as an\noverdraft protection line-of-credit or a plan to sweep funds from another account you have with us. We may use subsequent deposits,\nincluding direct deposits of social security or other government benefits, to cover such overdrafts.\nPayment types - Some, but not necessarily all, of the ways you can access the funds in your account include debit card transactions,\nautomated clearing house (ACH) transactions, and check transactions. All these payment types can use different processing systems and\nsome may take more or less time to post. This information is important for a number of reasons. For example, keeping track of the checks\nyou write and the timing of the preauthorized payments you set up will help you to know what other transactions might still post against your\naccount. For information about how and when we process these different payment types, see the “Payment order of items” subsection\nbelow.\nBalance information - Keeping track of your balance is important. You can review your balance in a number of ways including reviewing\nyour periodic statement, reviewing your balance online, accessing your account information by phone, or coming into one of our branches.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB 6/1/2022 9a,8d Custom TCM-35ac,2bm,3q 202210366-010 Page 3 of 25\nFunds availability - Knowing when funds you deposit will be made available for withdrawal is another important concept that can help you\navoid being assessed fees or charges. Please see our funds availability disclosure (generally titled, \"Your Ability to Withdraw Funds\") for\ninformation on when different types of deposits will be made available for withdrawal. For an account to which our funds availability policy\ndisclosure does not apply, you can ask us when you make a deposit when those funds will be available for withdrawal. An item may be\nreturned after the funds from the deposit of that item are made available for withdrawal. In that case, we will reverse the credit of the item.\nWe may determine the amount of available funds in your account for the purpose of deciding whether to return an item for insufficient funds\nat any time between the times we receive the item and when we return the item or send a notice in lieu of return. We need only make one\ndetermination, but if we choose to make a subsequent determination, the account balance at the subsequent time will determine whether\nthere are insufficient available funds.\nA temporary debit authorization hold affects your account balance - On debit card purchases, merchants may request a temporary\nhold on your account for a specified sum of money when the merchant does not know the exact amount of the purchase at the time the card\nis authorized. The amount of the temporary hold may be more than the actual amount of your purchase. Some common transactions where\nthis occurs involve purchases of gasoline, hotel rooms, or meals at restaurants. When this happens, our processing system cannot\ndetermine that the amount of the hold exceeds the actual amount of your purchase. This temporary hold, and the amount charged to your\naccount, will eventually be adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase, but it could be three calendar days, or even longer in some\ncases, before the adjustment is made. Until the adjustment is made, the amount of funds in your account available for other transactions will\nbe reduced by the amount of the temporary hold.\nDUE TO CHANGES IN NEW YORK STATE LAW WE ARE INFORMING YOU OF THE POSTING ORDER OF CHECKS AND\nSIMILAR ITEMS\nPayment order of items - The order in which items are paid is important if there is not enough money in your account to pay all of the items\nthat are presented. The payment order can affect the number of items overdrawn or returned unpaid and the amount of the fees you may\nhave to pay. To assist you in managing your account, we are providing you with the following information regarding how we process those\nitems.\nOur policy is to process ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions first-credits first, debits second in the order of lowest to highest for\nthe day on which they are processed. We process preauthorized internal transfers second-in the order the transfer record was initiated by\nyou. We process checks and similar items in the order in which they are received during nightly processing which usually occurs between\n9:00PM and 10:00PM. If a check is dishonored for insufficient funds and thereafter smaller checks which could be paid are received, the\nsmaller checks shall be honored within amounts on deposit in the subject account.\nWe process the following transactions in real time as they occur:\n• ATM, Online Banking and telephone transactions, debit PIN or on us items such as teller withdrawals at any Flushing Bank retail\nlocations initiated by you are processed in real-time if there is a sufficient available balance in the account to pay them.\n• Debit Card purchases initiated by you at a merchant as they are received throughout the day.\n• Wire transfer transactions initiated by you the same business day.\n• Bill Pay transactions are processed as they occur during the day for scheduled payments.\nIf a check, item or transaction is presented without sufficient funds in your account to pay it, we may, at our discretion, pay the item (creating\nan overdraft) or return the item for insufficient funds (NSF). We will not charge you a fee for paying an overdraft of an ATM or everyday debit\ncard transaction if this is a consumer account and you have not opted-in to that service. The amounts of the overdraft and NSF fees are\ndisclosed elsewhere, as are your rights to opt into overdraft services for ATM and everyday debit card transactions, if applicable. We\nencourage you to make careful records and practice good account management. This will help you to avoid creating items without sufficient\nfunds.\nOWNERSHIP OF ACCOUNT AND BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION - These rules apply to this account depending on the form of\nownership and beneficiary designation, if any, specified on the account records. We reserve the right to refuse some forms of ownership and\nbeneficiary designations on any or all of our accounts unless otherwise prohibited by law. We make no representations as to the\nappropriateness or effect of the ownership and beneficiary designations, except as they determine to whom we pay the account funds.\nIndividual Account - is an account in the name of one person.\nJoint Account - With Survivorship (And Not As Tenants In Common) - This is owned by two or more persons. Deposits and any\nadditions to the account are the property of the owners as joint tenants with right of survivorship. This means that we may release the entire\naccount to any owner during the lifetime of all owners. We may honor withdrawal requests (including checks or other orders) from any owner\nduring the lifetime of all owners. We may be required to release money in the account to satisfy a judgment against or other valid debt\nincurred by any owner. We may honor withdrawal requests (including checks or other orders) from any surviving owner after the death of\nany owner, and may treat the account as the sole property of the surviving owner(s). Unless an owner directs us by written notice not to\nhonor the withdrawal request (including checks or other orders) of an owner we will not be liable for doing so. After we receive such a notice,\nwe may require written authorization of any or all joint owners for any further payments or deliveries.\nConsumer accounts can only be established under Individual or Joint account entitlements.\nRevocable Trust Account - If two or more of you create such an account, you own the account jointly with survivorship. Beneficiaries\ncannot withdraw unless: (1) all persons creating the account die, and (2) the beneficiary is then living. If two or more beneficiaries are\nnamed and survive the death of all persons creating the account, such beneficiaries will own this account in equal shares, without right of\nsurvivorship. The person(s) creating this account type reserve the right to: (1) change beneficiaries, (2) change account types, and (3)\nwithdraw all or part of the account funds at any time.\nSTOP PAYMENTS - The rules in this section cover stopping payment of items such as checks and drafts. Rules for stopping payment of\nother types of transfers of funds, such as consumer electronic fund transfers, may be established by law or our policy. If we have not\ndisclosed these rules to you elsewhere, you may ask us about those rules.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB 6/1/2022 9a,8d Custom TCM-35ac,2bm,3q 202210366-010 Page 4 of 25\nA stop-payment order must be given in the manner required by law and must be received in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act\non it. Because the most effective way for us to execute a stop-payment order is by using an automated process, to be effective the order\nmust precisely identify the number, date and amount of the item, and the payee. We will honor a stop-payment request by the person who\nsigned the particular item, and, by any other person, even though such other person did not sign the item.\nGenerally, if your stop-payment order is given to us in writing it is effective for six months. Your order will lapse after that time if you do not\nrenew the order in writing before the end of the six-month period. If the original stop-payment order was oral your stop-payment order will\nlapse after 14 calendar days if you do not confirm your order in writing within that time period. We are not obligated to notify you when a\nstop-payment order expires.\nIf you stop payment on an item and we incur any damages or expenses because of the stop payment, you agree to indemnify us for those\ndamages or expenses, including attorneys’ fees. You assign to us all rights against the payee or any other holder of the item. You agree to\ncooperate with us in any legal actions that we may take against such persons. You should be aware that anyone holding the item may be\nentitled to enforce payment against you despite the stop-payment order.\nTELEPHONE TRANSFERS - A telephone transfer of funds from this account to another account with us, if otherwise arranged for or\npermitted, may be made by the same persons and under the same conditions generally applicable to withdrawals made in writing.\nLimitations on the number of telephonic transfers from a savings account, if any, are described elsewhere.\nAMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION - We may amend or delete any term of this agreement. We may also add new terms to this\nagreement. In addition, we may suspend, modify, convert, or terminate a service, convert this account to another account type, or close this\naccount for any reason. For any of these types of changes, we will give you reasonable notice in writing by any reasonable method including\nby mail, by any electronic communication method to which you have agreed, on or with a periodic statement, or through any other method\npermitted by law. If we close the account, we will tender the account balance to you or your agent personally, by mail, or by another agreed\nupon method.\nReasonable notice depends on the circumstances, and in some cases, such as when we cannot verify your identity or we suspect fraud, it\nmight be reasonable for us to give you notice after the change becomes effective. For instance, if we suspect fraudulent activity with respect\nto your account, and if we deem it appropriate under the circumstances and necessary to prevent further fraud, we might immediately freeze\nor close your account and then give you notice.\nUnless otherwise indicated in the notice of change, if we have notified you of a change to your account, and you continue to have your\naccount after the effective date of the change, you have accepted and agreed to the new or modified terms. You should review any change\nin terms notice carefully as the notice will provide important information of which you may need to be aware.\nWe reserve the right to waive any term of this agreement. However, such waiver shall not affect our right to enforce the term at a later date.\nIf you request that we close your account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in the account to cover any outstanding items or\ntransactions to be paid from the account. Once any outstanding items or transactions are paid, we will close the account and tender the\naccount balance, if any, to you or your agent personally, by mail, or by another agreed upon method.\nAny items and transactions presented for payment after the account is closed may be dishonored. Any deposits we receive after the\naccount is closed may be returned. We will not be liable for any damages for not honoring any such debits or deposits received after the\naccount is closed.\nNote: Rules governing changes in interest rates are provided separately in the Truth-in-Savings disclosure or in another document. In\naddition, for changes governed by a specific law or regulation, we will follow the specific timing and format notice requirements of those laws\nor regulations.\nCORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERRORS - Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you agree, if determined necessary in our reasonable\ndiscretion, to allow us to correct clerical errors, such as obtaining your missing signature, on any account documents or disclosures that are\npart of our agreement with you. For errors on your periodic statement, please refer to the STATEMENTS section.\nNOTICES - Any written notice you give us is effective when we actually receive it, and it must be given to us according to the specific\ndelivery instructions provided elsewhere, if any. We must receive any notice in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a notice\nis regarding a check or other item, you must give us sufficient information to be able to identify the check or item, including the precise\ncheck or item number, amount, date and payee. Notice we give you via the United States Mail is effective when it is deposited in the United\nStates Mail with proper postage and addressed to your mailing address we currently have on file. Notice we give you through your email of\nrecord, or other electronic method to which you agreed, will be treated as delivered to you when sent. Notice to any of you is notice to all of\nyou.\nSTATEMENTS - Your duty to report unauthorized signatures (including forgeries and counterfeit checks) and alterations on\nchecks and other items - You must examine your statement of account with “reasonable care and promptness.” If you discover (or\nreasonably should have discovered) any unauthorized signatures (including forgeries and counterfeit checks) or alterations, you must\npromptly notify us of the relevant facts. As between you and us, if you fail to do either of these duties, you will have to bear the entire loss.\nYour loss could be not only with respect to items on the statement but other items with unauthorized signatures or alterations by the same\nwrongdoer. We lose these protections if you establish that we failed to exercise ordinary care in paying an item with an unauthorized\nsignature or alteration.\nYou agree that the time you have to examine your statement and report to us will depend on the circumstances, but will not, in any\ncircumstance, exceed a total of 30 days from when the first statement on which the error appears is first sent or made available to you.\nYou further agree that if you fail to report any unauthorized signatures or alterations in your account within 60 days of when we first send or\nmake the first statement on which the error appears available to you, you cannot assert a claim against us on any items in that statement,\nand as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours. This 60-day limitation is without regard to whether we used ordinary care. The\nlimitation in this paragraph is in addition to that contained in the first paragraph of this section.\nYour duty to report other errors or problems - In addition to your duty to review your statements for unauthorized signatures and\nalterations, you agree to examine your statement with reasonable promptness for any other error or problem - such as an encoding error or\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

Also, if you receive or we make available either your items or images of your items, you must examine them\nfor any unauthorized or missing indorsements or any other problems. You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and\nitems and report to us will depend on the circumstances. However, this time period shall not exceed 60 days. Failure to examine your\nstatement and items and report any errors to us within 60 days of when we first send or make the statement available precludes you from\nasserting a claim against us for any errors on items identified in that statement and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours.\nErrors relating to electronic fund transfers or substitute checks (For Consumer Accounts) - For information on errors relating to\nelectronic fund transfers (e.g., online, mobile, debit card or ATM transactions) refer to your Electronic Fund Transfers disclosure and the\nsections on consumer liability and error resolution. For information on errors relating to a substitute check you received, refer to your\ndisclosure entitled Substitute Checks and Your Rights.\nDuty to notify if statement not received - You agree to immediately notify us if you do not receive your statement by the date you\nnormally expect to receive it. Not receiving your statement in a timely manner is a sign that there may be an issue with your account, such\nas possible fraud or identity theft. Absent a lack of ordinary care by us, a failure to receive your statement in a timely manner does not\nextend the time you have to conduct your review under this agreement.\nACCOUNT TRANSFER - This account may not be transferred or assigned without our prior written consent.\nREIMBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS - If we are required for any reason to reimburse the federal government for all\nor any portion of a benefit payment that was directly deposited into your account, you authorize us to deduct the amount of our liability to the\nfederal government from the account or from any other account you have with us, without prior notice and at any time, except as prohibited\nby law. We may also use any other available legal remedy to recover the amount of our liability.\nTEMPORARY ACCOUNT AGREEMENT - If the account documentation indicates that this is a temporary account agreement, each\nperson who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals (except as indicated to the contrary) may transact business on\nthis account. However, we may at some time in the future restrict or prohibit further use of this account if you fail to comply with the\nrequirements we have imposed within a reasonable time.\nSETOFF - You each agree that we may (when permitted by law) set off the funds in this account against any due and payable debt any of\nyou owe us now or in the future. If this account is owned by one or more of you as individuals, we may set off any funds in the account\nagainst a due and payable debt a partnership owes us now or in the future, to the extent of your liability as a partner for the partnership\ndebt. If your debt arises from a promissory note, then the amount of the due and payable debt will be the full amount we have demanded, as\nentitled under the terms of the note, and this amount may include any portion of the balance for which we have properly accelerated the due\ndate.\nThis right of setoff does not apply to this account if prohibited by law. For example, the right of setoff does not apply to this account if: (a) it is\nan Individual Retirement Account or similar tax-deferred account, or (b) the debt is created by a consumer credit transaction under a credit\ncard plan (but this does not affect our rights under any consensual security interest), or (c) the debtor’s right of withdrawal only arises in a\nrepresentative capacity, or (d) social security or supplemental security income payments are deposited directly into this account pursuant to\nan agreement with us which permits such direct deposit without presentation to you at the time of deposit. We will not be liable for the\ndishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs because we set off a debt against this account. You agree to hold us harmless from any\nclaim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of setoff.\nRESTRICTIVE LEGENDS OR INDORSEMENTS - The automated processing of the large volume of checks we receive prevents us from\ninspecting or looking for restrictive legends, restrictive indorsements or other special instructions on every check. For this reason, we are not\nrequired to honor any restrictive legend or indorsement or other special instruction placed on checks you write unless we have agreed in\nwriting to the restriction or instruction. Unless we have agreed in writing, we are not responsible for any losses, claims, damages, or\nexpenses that result from your placement of these restrictions or instructions on your checks. Examples of restrictive legends placed on\nchecks are “must be presented within 90 days” or “not valid for more than $1,000.00.” The payee’s signature accompanied by the words “for\ndeposit only” is an example of a restrictive indorsement.\nCHECK PROCESSING - We process items mechanically by relying almost exclusively on the information encoded in magnetic ink along\nthe bottom of the items. This means that we do not individually examine all of your items to determine if the item is properly completed,\nsigned and indorsed or to determine if it contains any information other than what is encoded in magnetic ink. You agree that we have\nexercised ordinary care if our automated processing is consistent with general banking practice, even though we do not inspect each item.\nBecause we do not inspect each item, if you write a check to multiple payees, we can properly pay the check regardless of the number of\nindorsements unless you notify us in writing that the check requires multiple indorsements. We must receive the notice in time for us to have\na reasonable opportunity to act on it, and you must tell us the precise date of the check, amount, check number and payee. We are not\nresponsible for any unauthorized signature or alteration that would not be identified by a reasonable inspection of the item. Using an\nautomated process helps us keep costs down for you and all account holders.\nCHECK CASHING - We may charge a fee for anyone that does not have an account with us who is cashing a check, draft or other\ninstrument written on your account. We may also require reasonable identification to cash a check, draft or other instrument. We can decide\nwhat identification is reasonable under the circumstances and such identification may be documentary or physical and may include\ncollecting a thumbprint or fingerprint.\nINDORSEMENTS - We may accept for deposit any item payable to you or your order, even if they are not indorsed by you. We may give\ncash back to any one of you. We may supply any missing indorsement(s) for any item we accept for deposit or collection, and you warrant\nthat all indorsements are genuine.\nTo ensure that your check or share draft is processed without delay, you must indorse it (sign it on the back) in a specific area. Your entire\nindorsement (whether a signature or a stamp) along with any other indorsement information (e.g. additional indorsements, ID information,\ndriver’s license number, etc.) must fall within 11/ 2” of the “trailing edge” of a check. Indorsements must be made in blue or black ink, so that\nthey are readable by automated check processing equipment.\nAs you look at the front of a check, the “trailing edge” is the left edge. When you flip the check over, be sure to keep all indorsement\ninformation within 11/ 2” of that edge.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

You agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold us\nharmless for any loss, liability, damage or expense that occurs because your indorsement, another indorsement or information you have\nprinted on the back of the check obscures our indorsement.\nThese indorsement guidelines apply to both personal and business checks.\nDEATH OR INCOMPETENCE - You agree to notify us promptly if any person with a right to withdraw funds from your account(s) dies or is\nadjudicated (determined by the appropriate official) incompetent. We may continue to honor your checks, items, and instructions until: (a)\nwe know of your death or adjudication of incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree\nthat we may pay or certify checks drawn on or before the date of death or adjudication of incompetence for up to ten (10) days after your\ndeath or adjudication of incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the account.\nFIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS - Accounts may be opened by a person acting in a fiduciary capacity. A fiduciary is someone who is appointed to\nact on behalf of and for the benefit of another. We are not responsible for the actions of a fiduciary, including the misuse of funds. This\naccount may be opened and maintained by a person or persons named as a trustee under a written trust agreement, or as executors,\nadministrators, or conservators under court orders. You understand that by merely opening such an account, we are not acting in the\ncapacity of a trustee in connection with the trust nor do we undertake any obligation to monitor or enforce the terms of the trust or letters.\nCREDIT VERIFICATION - You agree that we may verify credit and employment history by any necessary means, including preparation of\na credit report by a credit reporting agency.\nLEGAL ACTIONS AFFECTING YOUR ACCOUNT - If we are served with a subpoena, restraining order, writ of attachment or execution,\nlevy, garnishment, search warrant, or similar order relating to your account (termed \"legal action\" in this section), we will comply with that\nlegal action as required by applicable law. However, nothing in this agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any rights you may have\nunder applicable law with regards to such legal action. Subject to applicable law, we may, in our sole discretion, choose to freeze the assets\nin the account and not allow any payments or transfers out of the account, or take other action as may be appropriate under the\ncircumstances, until there is a final court determination regarding the legal action. We may do these things even if the legal action involves\nless than all of you. In these cases, we will not have any liability to you if there are insufficient funds to pay your items because we have\nwithdrawn funds from your account or in any way restricted access to your funds in accordance with the legal action and applicable law. Any\nfees or expenses we incur in responding to any legal action (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, and our internal expenses) may be\ncharged against your account, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. The list of fees applicable to your account(s) - provided\nelsewhere - may specify additional fees that we may charge for responding to certain legal actions.\nACCOUNT SECURITY -\nYour duty to protect account information and methods of access - Our policy may require methods of verifying your identity before\nproviding you with a service or allowing you access to your account. We can decide what identification is reasonable under the\ncircumstances. For example, process and identification requirements may vary depending on whether they are online or in person.\nIdentification may be documentary or physical and may include collecting a fingerprint, voiceprint, or other biometric information.\nIt is your responsibility to protect the account numbers and electronic access devices (e.g., an ATM card) we provide you for your accounts.\nYou should also safeguard your username, password, and other access and identifying information when accessing your account through a\ncomputer or other electronic, audio, or mobile device or technology. If you give anyone authority to access the account on your behalf, you\nshould exercise caution and ensure the trustworthiness of that agent. Do not discuss, compare, or share information about your account\nnumbers with anyone unless you are willing to give them full use of your money. An account number can be used by thieves to issue an\nelectronic debit or to encode your number on a false demand draft which looks like and functions like an authorized check. If you furnish\nyour access device or information and grant actual authority to make transfers to another person (a family member or coworker, for\nexample) who then exceeds that authority, you are liable for the transfers unless we have been notified that transfers by that person are no\nlonger authorized. Your account number can also be used to electronically remove money from your account, and payment can be made\nfrom your account even though you did not contact us directly and order the payment.\nYou must also take precaution in safeguarding your blank checks. Notify us at once if you believe your checks have been lost or stolen. If\nyou are negligent in safeguarding your checks we will not be responsible for any losses you incur due to an alteration or forgery if we have\npaid the check in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.\nPositive pay and other fraud prevention services - Except for consumer electronic fund transfers subject to Regulation E, you agree that\nif we offer you services appropriate for your account to help identify and limit fraud or other unauthorized transactions against your account,\nand you reject those services, you will be responsible for any fraudulent or unauthorized transactions which could have been prevented by\nthe services we offered. You will not be responsible for such transactions if we acted in bad faith or to the extent our negligence contributed\nto the loss. Such services include positive pay or commercially reasonable security procedures. If we offered you a commercially reasonable\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

The positive pay service can help detect and prevent check fraud\nand is appropriate for account holders that issue a high volume of checks, a lot of checks to the general public, or checks for large dollar\namounts.\nINSTRUCTIONS FROM YOU - Unless required by law or we have agreed otherwise in writing, we are not required to act upon instructions\nyou give us via facsimile transmission, email, voicemail, or phone call to a facsimile number, email address, or phone number not\ndesignated by us for a particular purpose or for a purpose that is unrelated to the request or instruction.\nMONITORING AND RECORDING TELEPHONE CALLS AND ACCOUNT COMMUNICATIONS - Subject to federal and state law, we may\nmonitor or record phone calls for security reasons, to maintain a record, and to ensure that you receive courteous and efficient service. You\nconsent in advance to any such recording.\nTo provide you with the best possible service in our ongoing business relationship for your account, we may need to contact you about your\naccount from time to time by telephone, text messaging, or email. In contacting you about your account, we may use any telephone\nnumbers or email addresses that you have previously provided to us by virtue of an existing business relationship or that you may\nsubsequently provide to us.\nYou acknowledge that the number we use to contact you may be assigned to a landline, a paging service, a cellular wireless service, a\nspecialized mobile radio service, other radio common carrier service, or any other service for which you may be charged for the call. You\nacknowledge that we may contact you by voice, voicemail, or text messaging. You further acknowledge that we may use pre-recorded voice\nmessages, artificial voice messages, or automatic telephone dialing systems.\nIf necessary, you may change or remove any of the telephone numbers, email addresses, or other methods of contacting you at any time\nusing any reasonable means to notify us.\nCLAIM OF LOSS - The following rules do not apply to a transaction or claim related to a consumer electronic fund transfer governed by\nRegulation E (e.g., an every day/one-time consumer debit card or ATM transaction). The error resolution procedures for consumer\nelectronic fund transfers can be found in our initial Regulation E disclosure generally titled, \"Electronic Fund Transfers.\" For other\ntransactions or claims, if you claim a credit or refund because of a forgery, alteration, or any other unauthorized withdrawal, you agree to\ncooperate with us in the investigation of the loss, including giving us an affidavit containing whatever reasonable information we require\nconcerning your account, the transaction, and the circumstances surrounding the loss. You will notify law enforcement authorities of any\ncriminal act related to the claim of lost, missing, or stolen checks or unauthorized withdrawals. We will have a reasonable period of time to\ninvestigate the facts and circumstances surrounding any claim of loss. Unless we have acted in bad faith, we will not be liable for special or\nconsequential damages, including loss of profits or opportunity, or for attorneys’ fees incurred by you.\nYou agree that you will not waive any rights you have to recover your loss against anyone who is obligated to repay, insure, or otherwise\nreimburse you for your loss. You will pursue your rights or, at our option, assign them to us so that we may pursue them. Our liability will be\nreduced by the amount you recover or are entitled to recover from these other sources.\nEARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES (and involuntary withdrawals) - We may impose early withdrawal penalties on a withdrawal from a\ntime account even if you don’t initiate the withdrawal. For instance, the early withdrawal penalty may be imposed if the withdrawal is caused\nby our setoff against funds in the account or as a result of an attachment or other legal process. We may close your account and impose the\nearly withdrawal penalty on the entire account balance in the event of a partial early withdrawal. See your separately provided notice of\npenalty for early withdrawal for additional information.\nCHANGES IN NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION - You are responsible for notifying us of any change in your name, address, or other\ninformation we use to communicate with you. Unless we agree otherwise, notice of such a change must be made in writing. Informing us of\nyour address or name change on a check reorder form is not sufficient. We will attempt to communicate with you only by use of the most\nrecent information you have provided to us. If provided elsewhere, we may impose a service fee if we attempt to locate you.\nRESOLVING ACCOUNT DISPUTES - We may place an administrative hold on the funds in your account (refuse payment or withdrawal\nof the funds) if it becomes subject to a claim adverse to (1) your own interest; (2) others claiming an interest as survivors or beneficiaries of\nyour account; or (3) a claim arising by operation of law. The hold may be placed for such period of time as we believe reasonably necessary\nto allow a legal proceeding to determine the merits of the claim or until we receive evidence satisfactory to us that the dispute has been\nresolved. We will not be liable for any items that are dishonored as a consequence of placing a hold on funds in your account for these\nreasons.\nWAIVER OF NOTICES - To the extent permitted by law, you waive any notice of non-payment, dishonor or protest regarding any items\ncredited to or charged against your account. For example, if you deposit an item and it is returned unpaid or we receive a notice of\nnonpayment, we do not have to notify you unless required by federal Regulation CC or other law.\nACH AND WIRE TRANSFERS (For Consumer Accounts) - This agreement is subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code -\nFund Transfers as adopted in the state in which you have your account with us. If you originate a fund transfer and you identify by name and\nnumber a beneficiary financial institution, an intermediary financial institution or a beneficiary, we and every receiving or beneficiary financial\ninstitution may rely on the identifying number to make payment. We may rely on the number even if it identifies a financial institution, person\nor account other than the one named. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association rules. These rules provide, among\nother things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional until final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank\nor payment is otherwise made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code. If we do not receive such payment, we are\nentitled to a refund from you in the amount credited to your account and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have\npaid the amount so credited. Credit entries may be made by ACH. If we receive a payment order to credit an account you have with us by\nwire or ACH, we are not required to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.\nINTERNATIONAL ACH TRANSACTIONS - Financial institutions are required by law to scrutinize or verify any international ACH transaction\n(IAT) that they receive against the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This action\nmay, from time to time, cause us to temporarily suspend processing of an IAT and potentially affect the settlement and/or availability of such\npayments.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

If we do agree to honor items containing facsimile signatures, you authorize us, at any time, to charge you for\nall checks, drafts, or other orders, for the payment of money, that are drawn on us. You give us this authority regardless of by whom or by\nwhat means the facsimile signature(s) may have been affixed so long as they resemble the facsimile signature specimen filed with us, and\ncontain the required number of signatures for this purpose. You must notify us at once if you suspect that your facsimile signature is being\nor has been misused.\nSTALE-DATED CHECKS - We are not obligated to, but may at our option, pay a check, other than a certified check, presented for\npayment more than six months after its date. If you do not want us to pay a stale-dated check, you must place a stop-payment order on the\ncheck in the manner we have described elsewhere.\nThe Bank will not be responsible if it refuses to accept (pay) a check you have written because there are not enough funds in the account\nafter we have deducted a service charge.\nDORMANT ACCOUNTS - Your account will be considered dormant if all of the following occur for three consecutive years: (1) deposits\nare not made to your account; (2) withdrawals are not made to your account; or (3) the bank does not receive any correspondence from you\nwhich indicates that you know that your account with the bank is still in existence. Interest crediting is not considered a deposit for this\npurpose. In accordance with the N.Y. State Abandoned Property Law, dormant funds will be turned over to the State of New York. You may\nsubmit a claim for return of the funds to: New York State Office of the State Comptroller, Office of Unclaimed Funds, 110 State Street,\nAlbany, New York 12236.\nTRUNCATION, SUBSTITUTE CHECKS, AND OTHER CHECK IMAGES - If you truncate an original check and create a substitute\ncheck, or other paper or electronic image of the original check, you warrant that no one will be asked to make payment on the original\ncheck, a substitute check or any other electronic or paper image, if the payment obligation relating to the original check has already been\npaid. You also warrant that any substitute check you create conforms to the legal requirements and generally accepted specifications for\nsubstitute checks. You agree to retain the original check in conformance with our policy for retaining original checks. You agree to indemnify\nus for any loss we may incur as a result of any truncated check transaction you initiate. We can refuse to accept substitute checks that have\nnot previously been warranted by a bank or other financial institution in conformance with the Check 21 Act. Unless specifically stated in a\nseparate agreement between you and us, we do not have to accept any other electronic or paper image of an original check.\nREMOTELY CREATED CHECKS - Like any standard check or draft, a remotely created check (sometimes called a telecheck,\npreauthorized draft or demand draft) is a check or draft that can be used to withdraw money from an account. Unlike a typical check or draft,\nhowever, a remotely created check is not issued by the paying bank and does not contain the signature of the account owner (or a signature\npurported to be the signature of the account owner). In place of a signature, the check usually has a statement that the owner authorized the\ncheck or has the owner’s name typed or printed on the signature line.\nYou warrant and agree to the following for every remotely created check we receive from you for deposit or collection: (1) you have received\nexpress and verifiable authorization to create the check in the amount and to the payee that appears on the check; (2) you will maintain\nproof of the authorization for at least 2 years from the date of the authorization, and supply us the proof if we ask; and (3) if a check is\nreturned you owe us the amount of the check, regardless of when the check is returned. We may take funds from your account to pay the\namount you owe us, and if there are insufficient funds in your account, you still owe us the remaining balance.\n—————————————\nNOTICE OF NEGATIVE INFORMATION\nFederal law requires us to provide the following notice to customers before any \"negative information\" may be furnished to a nationwide\nconsumer reporting agency. \"Negative information\" includes information concerning delinquencies, overdrafts or any form of default. This\nnotice does not mean that we will be reporting such information about you, only that we may report such information about customers that\nhave not done what they are required to do under our agreement.\nAfter providing this notice, additional negative information may be submitted without providing another notice.\nWe may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments or other defaults on your\naccount may be reflected in your credit report.\n—————————————\nELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFERS\nYOUR RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES\n(CONSUMER ACCOUNTS ONLY)\nThis Electronic Fund Transfer disclosure does not apply to any accounts other than consumer accounts, as defined by Regulation E.\nIndicated below are types of Electronic Fund Transfers we are capable of handling, some of which may not apply to your account. Please\nread this disclosure carefully because it tells you your rights and obligations for the transactions listed. You should keep this notice for future\nreference.\nElectronic Fund Transfers Initiated By Third Parties. You may authorize a third party to initiate electronic fund transfers between your\naccount and the third party’s account. These transfers to make or receive payment may be one-time occurrences or may recur as directed\nby you. These transfers may use the Automated Clearing House (ACH) or other payments network. Your authorization to the third party to\nmake these transfers can occur in a number of ways. For example, your authorization to convert a check to an electronic fund transfer or to\nelectronically pay a returned check charge can occur when a merchant provides you with notice and you go forward with the transaction\n(typically, at the point of purchase, a merchant will post a sign and print the notice on a receipt). In all cases, these third party transfers will\nrequire you to provide the third party with your account number and bank information. This information can be found on your check as well\nas on a deposit or withdrawal slip. Thus, you should only provide your bank and account information (whether over the phone, the Internet,\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

Examples of these\ntransfers include, but are not limited to:\n• Preauthorized credits.

You may make arrangements to pay certain recurring bills from your Checking, Savings, or Money\nMarket account(s).\n• Electronic check conversion. You may authorize a merchant or other payee to make a one-time electronic payment from your\nchecking account using information from your check to pay for purchases or pay bills.\n• Electronic returned check charge. You may authorize a merchant or other payee to initiate an electronic funds transfer to collect a\ncharge in the event a check is returned for insufficient funds.\nTelephone Banking - types of transfers - You may access your account by telephone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at 1-877-226-5873\nusing your account numbers, your social security number, and your personal security code, to:\n• transfer funds between checking, savings, and money market account(s)\n• get information about:\n- the account balance of checking, savings, or money market account(s)\n- deposits to checking, savings, or money market account(s)\n- withdrawals from checking, savings, or money market account(s)\nATM Transactions - types of transactions, dollar limitations, and charges - You may access your account(s) by ATM using your ATM\ncard or debit card and personal identification number (PIN), to:\n• make deposits to checking account(s) only at ATMs we own or operate\n• make deposits to savings account(s) only at ATMs we own or operate\n• make deposits Money Market account(s) only at ATMs we own or operate\n• get cash withdrawals from checking account(s)\n- using your ATM card, you may withdraw no more than $1,000.00 per business day per card\n- using your debit card, you may withdraw no more than $1,000.00 per day, per debit card\n- there is a charge per withdrawal at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule)\n• get cash withdrawals from Complete Money Market account(s)\n- using your ATM card, you may withdraw no more than $1,000.00 per business day per card\n- using your debit card, you may withdraw no more than $1,000.00 per day, per debit card\n- there is a charge per withdrawal at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule)\n• get cash withdrawals from savings account(s)\n- using your ATM card, you may withdraw no more than $1,000.00 per business day per card\n- using your debit card, you may withdraw no more than $1,000.00 per day, per debit card\n- there is a charge per withdrawal at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule)\n• get cash withdrawals from Complete Checking Premier account(s)\n- using your debit card, you may withdraw no more than $2,500.00 per day, per debit card\n- there may be a charge per withdrawal at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule); all surcharge fees are rebated at the\nend of the month for Premier accounts\n• get cash withdrawals from Maximum Money Market account(s)\n- using your debit card, you may withdraw no more than $2,500.00 per day, per debit card\n- there may be a charge per withdrawal at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule); all surcharge fees are rebated at the\nend of the month for Premier accounts\n• transfer funds from savings to checking account(s)\n• transfer funds from checking to savings account(s)\n• transfer funds from money market to checking account(s)\n• transfer funds from money market to savings account(s)\n• transfer funds from money market to money market account(s)\n• transfer funds from checking to checking account(s)\n• transfer funds from savings to savings account(s)\n• get information about:\n- the account balance of your checking accounts\n• there is a charge per inquiry at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule)\n- the account balance of your savings accounts\n• there is a charge per inquiry at ATMs we do not own or operate (refer to fee schedule)\nSome of these services may not be available at all terminals.\nTypes of Debit Card Point-of-Sale Transactions - You may access your checking account(s) to purchase goods (in person or by phone),\npay for services (in person or by phone), get cash from a merchant, if the merchant permits, or from a participating financial institution, and\ndo anything that a participating merchant will accept.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

If you initiate a transaction with your debit card in a currency other than US Dollars, Mastercard will convert the\ncharge into a US Dollar amount. The Mastercard currency conversion procedure is based on rates observed in the wholesale market or,\nwhere applicable, on government-mandated rates. The currency conversion rate Mastercard generally uses is the rate for the applicable\ncurrency that is in effect on the day the transaction occurred.

You can get a receipt at the time you make a transfer to or from your account using an automated teller machine\nor point-of-sale terminal. However, you may not get a receipt if the amount of the transfer is $15 or less.\n• Preauthorized credits.

In any case, you will get a statement at\nleast quarterly.\nYou will get an account statement twice a year from us if your account is set up as an IRA Savings account, and the only possible\nelectronic transfers to or from the account are preauthorized deposits.\nPREAUTHORIZED PAYMENTS\n• Right to stop payment and procedure for doing so. If you have told us in advance to make regular payments out of your account,\nyou can stop any of these payments.

If you call, we may also require you to put your request in writing and get it to us\nwithin 14 days after you call.\n• Notice of varying amounts. If these regular payments may vary in amount, the person you are going to pay will tell you, 10 days\nbefore each payment, when it will be made and how much it will be.

If we do not complete a transfer to or from your account on time or in the correct amount\naccording to our agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be\nliable, for instance:\n(1) If, through no fault of ours, you do not have enough money in your account to make the transfer.\n(2) If you have an overdraft line and the transfer would go over the credit limit.\n(3) If the automated teller machine where you are making the transfer does not have enough cash.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

Tell us AT ONCE if you believe your card and/or code has been lost or stolen, or if you believe that an electronic fund\ntransfer has been made without your permission using information from your check. Telephoning is the best way of keeping your possible\nlosses down. You could lose all the money in your account (plus your maximum overdraft line of credit). If you tell us within 2 business days\nafter you learn of the loss or theft of your card and/or code, you can lose no more than $50 if someone used your card and/or code without\nyour permission.\nIf you do NOT tell us within 2 business days after you learn of the loss or theft of your card and/or code, and we can prove we could have\nstopped someone from using your card and/or code without your permission if you had told us, you could lose as much as $500.\nAlso, if your statement shows transfers that you did not make, including those made by card, code or other means, tell us at once. If you\ndo not tell us within 60 days after the statement was mailed to you, you may not get back any money you lost after the 60 days if we can\nprove that we could have stopped someone from taking the money if you had told us in time.\nIf a good reason (such as a long trip or a hospital stay) kept you from telling us, we will extend the time periods.\n• Additional Limits on Liability for debit card. You will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using your debit card if: (i) you can\ndemonstrate that you have exercised reasonable care in safeguarding your card from the risk of loss or theft, and (ii) upon becoming aware\nof a loss or theft, you promptly report the loss or theft to us. Mastercard is a registered trademark, and the circles design is a trademark of\nMastercard International Incorporated.\n(b) Contact in event of unauthorized transfer. If you believe your card and/or code has been lost or stolen, call or write us at the\ntelephone number or address listed in this disclosure. You should also call the number or write to the address listed in this disclosure if you\nbelieve a transfer has been made using the information from your check without your permission.\nERROR RESOLUTION NOTICE\nIn Case of Errors or Questions About Your Electronic Transfers, Call or Write us at the telephone number or address listed in this disclosure,\nas soon as you can, if you think your statement or receipt is wrong or if you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or\nreceipt. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent the FIRST statement on which the problem or error appeared.\n(1) Tell us your name and account number (if any).\n(2) Describe the error or the transfer you are unsure about, and explain as clearly as you can why you believe it is an error or why you\nneed more information.\n(3) Tell us the dollar amount of the suspected error.\nIf you tell us orally, we may require that you send us your complaint or question in writing within 10 business days.\nWe will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days (20 business days if the transfer involved a new account) after we\nhear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 days (90 days if the transfer\ninvolved a new account, a point-of-sale transaction, or a foreign-initiated transfer) to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to\ndo this, we will credit your account within 10 business days (20 business days if the transfer involved a new account) for the amount you\nthink is in error, so that you will have the use of the money during the time it takes us to complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your\ncomplaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your account. Your account is\nconsidered a new account for the first 30 days after the first deposit is made, unless each of you already has an established account with us\nbefore this account is opened.\nWe will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send\nyou a written explanation.\nYou may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.\nFLUSHING BANK\nP.O. BOX 9000\nEAST MEADOW, NEW YORK 11554\nBusiness Days: Monday through Friday\nExcluding Federal Holidays\nPhone: 800-581-2889\nMORE DETAILED INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON REQUEST\nNOTICE OF ATM/NIGHT DEPOSIT\nFACILITY USER PRECAUTIONS\nAs with all financial transactions, please exercise discretion when using an automated teller machine (ATM) or night deposit facility. For\nyour own safety, be careful. The following suggestions may be helpful.\n1. Prepare for your transactions at home (for instance, by filling out a deposit slip) to minimize your time at the ATM or night deposit\nfacility.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB 6/1/2022 9a,8d Custom TCM-35ac,2bm,3q 202210366-010 Page 12 of 25\n2. Mark each transaction in your account record, but not while at the ATM or night deposit facility. Always save your ATM receipts. Don’t\nleave them at the ATM or night deposit facility because they may contain important account information.\n3. Compare your records with the account statements or account histories that you receive.\n4. Don’t lend your ATM card to anyone.\n5. Remember, do not leave your card at the ATM. Do not leave any documents at a night deposit facility.\n6. If you lose your ATM card or if it is stolen, promptly notify us. You should consult the other disclosures you have received about\nelectronic fund transfers for additional information about what to do if your card is lost or stolen.\n7. Protect the secrecy of your Personal Identification Number (PIN). Protect your ATM card as though it were cash. Don’t tell anyone\nyour PIN. Don’t give anyone information regarding your ATM card or PIN over the telephone. Never enter your PIN in any ATM that\ndoes not look genuine, has been modified, has a suspicious device attached, or is operating in a suspicious manner. Don’t write your\nPIN where it can be discovered. For example, don’t keep a note of your PIN in your wallet or purse.\n8. Prevent others from seeing you enter your PIN by using your body to shield their view.\n9. Don’t accept assistance from anyone you don’t know when using an ATM or night deposit facility.\n10. When you make a transaction, be alert to your surroundings. Look out for suspicious activity near the ATM or night deposit facility,\nparticularly if it is after sunset. At night, be sure that the facility (including the parking area and walkways) is well lighted. Consider\nhaving someone accompany you when you use the facility, especially after sunset. Defer your transaction if circumstances cause you to\nbe apprehensive for your safety. You might consider using another ATM or night deposit facility.\n11. If you notice anything suspicious or if any other problem arises after you have begun an ATM transaction, you may want to cancel the\ntransaction, pocket your card and leave. You might consider using another ATM or coming back later.\n12. Please be sure to close any entry door completely upon entering and exiting the ATM or night depository facility. Do not permit any\nunknown persons to enter the facility after regular banking hours.\n13. Don’t display your cash; place withdrawn cash securely upon your person before exiting the ATM. Count the cash later when you are\nin the safety of your own car, home, or other secure surrounding.\n14. At a drive-up facility, make sure all the car doors are locked and all of the windows are rolled up, except the driver’s window. Keep\nthe engine running and remain alert to your surroundings.\n15. We want the ATM and night deposit facility to be safe and convenient for you. The activity of the automated teller machine facility may be\nrecorded by a surveillance camera or cameras. Please tell us if you know of any problem with a facility. For instance, let us know if a light\nis not working or there is any damage to a facility. Please use the nearest available public telephone to call the police if emergency\nassistance is needed. Direct complaints concerning ATM facility security to us at the phone number listed in this disclosure or the New\nYork Department of Financial Services Consumer Services Hotline at 1-800-342-3736.\n—————————————\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

The following Substitute Check Disclosure provides\ninformation about substitute checks and your rights. So you will recognize substitute checks when you receive them, we have included a\ncopy of the front side of a substitute check along with an explanation of the substitute check's components.\nWhat is a substitute check?\nTo make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks.” These checks are similar\nin size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states:\n“This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as\nproof of payment just like the original check.\nSome or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you have when you\nreceive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However,\nyou have rights under other law with respect to those transactions.\nWhat are my rights regarding substitute checks?\nIn certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is\nposted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from\nyour account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount\nthat was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees).\nThe amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is\nless. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the\namount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law.\nIf you use this procedure, you may receive up to $2,500 of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within 10 business\ndays after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than 45 calendar\ndays after we received your claim.\nWe may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was\ncorrectly posted to your account.\nHow do I make a claim for a refund?\nIf you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please\ncontact us at:\nFlushing Bank\nDeposit Operations\nP.O. Box 9000\nEast Meadow NY 11554\n800-581-2889\nYou must contact us within 60 calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the\nsubstitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We\nwill extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances.\nYour claim must include —\n• A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect);\n• An estimate of the amount of your loss;\n• An explanation of why the substitute check you received is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and\n• A copy of the substitute check or the following information to help us identify the substitute check: the check number, the amount of\nthe check, the date of the check, and the name of the person to whom you wrote the check.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

You can use it the same way you would use the original check.\n6 The MICR lines at the bottom of the image of the original and at the bottom of the substitute check are the same except for the “4” at the\nbeginning of the MICR line on the substitute check, which indicates that it is a substitute check being moved forward for collection\npurposes. It is also possible for the MICR line on the substitute check to begin with a “5” if the item is being returned. The rest of the\nMICR line is the same as the original check to ensure that it is processed as though it were the original.\n—————————————\nRev. 05/24\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 1 of 20\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nOF YOUR ACCOUNT\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT - To help the government fight the funding\nof terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that\nidentifies each person who opens an account.\nWhat this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow\nus to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.\nAGREEMENT - This document, along with any other documents we give you pertaining to your account(s), is a contract (also referred to as\n“this agreement”) that establishes rules which control your account(s) with us. Please read this carefully and retain it for future reference. If\nyou open the account (whether in-person, electronically, or by any other method permitted by us) or continue to use the account after\nreceiving a notice of change or amendment, you agree to these rules. You will receive a separate schedule of rates, qualifying balances,\nand fees if they are not included in this agreement. If you have any questions, please ask us.\nThis agreement is subject to applicable federal laws, the laws of the state of New York and other applicable rules such as the operating\nletters of the Federal Reserve Banks and payment processing system rules (except to the extent that this agreement can and does vary\nsuch rules or laws). The body of state and federal law that governs our relationship with you, however, is too large and complex to be\nreproduced here. The purpose of this agreement is to:\n(1) summarize some laws that apply to common transactions;\n(2) establish rules to cover transactions or events which the law does not regulate;\n(3) establish rules for certain transactions or events which the law regulates but permits variation by agreement; and\n(4) give you disclosures of some of our policies to which you may be entitled or in which you may be interested.\nIf any provision of this agreement is found to be unenforceable according to its terms, all remaining provisions will continue in full force and\neffect. We may permit some variations from our standard agreement, but we must agree to any variation in writing either on the signature\ncard for your account or in some other document. Nothing in this agreement is intended to vary our duty to act in good faith and with\nordinary care when required by law.\nAs used in this agreement the words “we,” “our,” and “us” mean the financial institution and the words “you” and “your” mean the account\nholder(s) and anyone else with the authority to deposit, withdraw, or exercise control over the funds in the account. However, this\nagreement does not intend, and the terms “you” and “your” should not be interpreted, to expand an individual’s responsibility for an\norganization’s liability. If this account is owned by a corporation, partnership or other organization, individual liability is determined by the\nlaws generally applicable to that type of organization. The headings in this agreement are for convenience or reference only and will not\ngovern the interpretation of the provisions. Unless it would be inconsistent to do so, words and phrases used in this agreement should be\nconstrued so the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.\nARBITRATION - Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any alleged breach thereof, shall be resolved by final and\nbinding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be\nconducted in the state of New York by a single arbitrator who is experienced in banking law and agreed upon by the parties. A judgment\nbased upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\nLIABILITY - You agree, for yourself (and the person or entity you represent if you sign as a representative of another) to the terms of this\naccount and the schedule of charges. You authorize us to deduct these charges, without notice to you, directly from the account balance as\naccrued. You will pay any additional reasonable charges for services you request which are not covered by this agreement.\nEach of you also agrees to be jointly and severally (individually) liable for any account shortage resulting from charges or overdrafts,\nwhether caused by you or another with access to this account. This liability is due immediately, and we can deduct any amounts deposited\ninto the account and apply those amounts to the shortage. You have no right to defer payment of this liability, and you are liable regardless\nof whether you signed the item or benefited from the charge or overdraft.\nYou will be liable for our costs as well as for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, to the extent permitted by law, whether incurred as a result of\ncollection or in any other dispute involving your account. This includes, but is not limited to, disputes between you and another joint owner;\nyou and an authorized signer or similar party; or a third party claiming an interest in your account. This also includes any action that you or a\nthird party takes regarding the account that causes us, in good faith, to seek the advice of an attorney, whether or not we become involved\nin the dispute. All costs and attorneys’ fees can be deducted from your account when they are incurred, without notice to you.\nDEPOSITS - We will give only provisional credit until collection is final for any items, other than cash, we accept for deposit (including items\ndrawn “on us”). Before settlement of any item becomes final, we act only as your agent, regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of\nindorsement on the item and even though we provide you provisional credit for the item. We may reverse any provisional credit for items\nthat are lost, stolen, or returned. Unless prohibited by law, we also reserve the right to charge back to your account the amount of any item\ndeposited to your account or cashed for you which was initially paid by the payor bank and which is later returned to us due to an allegedly\nforged, unauthorized or missing indorsement, claim of alteration, encoding error, counterfeit cashier’s check or other problem which in our\njudgment justifies reversal of credit. You authorize us to attempt to collect previously returned items without giving you notice, and in\nattempting to collect we may permit the payor bank to hold an item beyond the midnight deadline. Actual credit for deposits of, or payable in,\nforeign currency will be at the exchange rate in effect on final collection in U.S. dollars. We are not responsible for transactions by mail or\noutside depository until we actually record them. If you deliver a deposit to us and you will not be present when the deposit is counted, you\nmust provide us an itemized list of the deposit (deposit slip). To process the deposit, we will verify and record the deposit, and credit the\ndeposit to the account. If there are any discrepancies between the amounts shown on the itemized list of the deposit and the amount we\ndetermine to be the actual deposit, we will notify you of the discrepancy. You will be entitled to credit only for the actual deposit as\ndetermined by us, regardless of what is stated on the itemized deposit slip. We will treat and record all transactions received after our “daily\ncutoff time” on a business day we are open, or received on a day we are not open for business, as if initiated on the next business day that\nwe are open. At our option, we may take an item for collection rather than for deposit. If we accept a third-party check or draft for deposit,\nwe may require any third-party indorsers to verify or guarantee their indorsements, or indorse in our presence.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

Each of you (until we receive written notice to the contrary) authorizes each other person who signs or has\nauthority to make withdrawals to indorse any item payable to you or your order for deposit to this account or any other transaction with us.\nPostdated checks - A postdated check is one which bears a date later than the date on which the check is written. We may properly pay and\ncharge your account for a postdated check even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless we have received written\nnotice of the postdating in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act. Because we process checks mechanically, your notice will not be\neffective and we will not be liable for failing to honor your notice unless it precisely identifies the number, date, amount and payee of the item.\nChecks and withdrawal rules - If you do not purchase your check blanks from us, you must be certain that we approve the check blanks\nyou purchase. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which you attempt on forms not approved by us or by any method we do\nnot specifically permit. We may refuse any withdrawal or transfer request which is greater in number than the frequency permitted by our\npolicy, or which is for an amount greater or less than any withdrawal limitations. We will use the date the transaction is completed by us (as\nopposed to the date you initiate it) to apply any frequency limitations. In addition, we may place limitations on the account until your identity\nis verified.\nEven if we honor a nonconforming request, we are not required to do so later. If you violate the stated transaction limitations (if any), in our\ndiscretion we may close your account or reclassify your account as another type of account. If we reclassify your account, your account will\nbe subject to the fees and earnings rules of the new account classification.\nIf we are presented with an item drawn against your account that would be a “substitute check,” as defined by law, but for an error or defect\nin the item introduced in the substitute check creation process, you agree that we may pay such item.\nCash withdrawals - We recommend you take care when making large cash withdrawals because carrying large amounts of cash may pose\na danger to your personal safety. As an alternative to making a large cash withdrawal, you may want to consider a cashier’s check or similar\ninstrument. You assume full responsibility of any loss in the event the cash you withdraw is lost, stolen, or destroyed. You agree to hold us\nharmless from any loss you incur as a result of your decision to withdraw funds in the form of cash.\nMultiple signatures, electronic check conversion, and similar transactions - An electronic check conversion transaction is a transaction\nwhere a check or similar item is converted into an electronic fund transfer as defined in the Electronic Fund Transfers regulation. In these\ntypes of transactions the check or similar item is either removed from circulation (truncated) or given back to you. As a result, we have no\nopportunity to review the signatures or otherwise examine the original check or item. You agree that, as to these or any items as to which\nwe have no opportunity to examine the signatures, you waive any requirement of multiple signatures.\nNotice of withdrawal - We reserve the right to require not less than 7 days’ notice in writing before each withdrawal from an interest-\nbearing account, other than a time deposit or demand deposit, or from any other savings deposit as defined by Regulation D. (The law\nrequires us to reserve this right, but it is not our general policy to use it.) Withdrawals from a time account prior to maturity or prior to any\nnotice period may be restricted and may be subject to penalty. See your separately provided notice of penalty for early withdrawal.\nUNDERSTANDING AND AVOIDING OVERDRAFT AND NONSUFFICIENT FUNDS (NSF) POSITIONS -\nDetermining your available balance - We use the “available balance” method to determine whether your account is overdrawn, that is,\nwhether there is enough money in your account to pay for a transaction. Importantly, your “available” balance may not be the same as your\naccount’s “actual” balance. This means an overdraft or an NSF transaction could occur regardless of your account’s actual balance.\nYour account’s actual balance (sometimes called the ledger balance) only includes transactions that have settled up to that point in time,\nthat is, transactions (deposits and payments) that have posted to your account. The actual balance does not include outstanding\ntransactions (such as checks that have not yet cleared and electronic transactions that have been authorized but which are still pending).\nThe balance on your periodic statement is the ledger balance for your account as of the statement date.\nAs the name implies, your available balance is calculated based on the money “available” in your account to make payments. In other\nwords, the available balance takes ACH credit transactions and debit card transactions that have been authorized, but not yet settled, and\nadds or subtracts them from the actual balance. In addition, when calculating your available balance, any “holds” placed on deposits that\nhave not yet cleared are also subtracted from the actual balance. For more information on how holds placed on funds in your account can\nimpact your available balance, read the subsection titled “A temporary debit authorization hold affects your account balance.”\nOverdrafts - You understand that we may, at our discretion, honor withdrawal requests that overdraw your account. However, the fact that\nwe may honor withdrawal requests that overdraw the account balance does not obligate us to do so later. So you can NOT rely on us to pay\noverdrafts on your account regardless of how frequently or under what circumstances we have paid overdrafts on your account in the past.\nWe can change our practice of paying, or not paying, discretionary overdrafts on your account without notice to you. You can ask us if we\nhave other account services that might be available to you where we commit to paying overdrafts under certain circumstances, such as an\noverdraft protection line-of-credit or a plan to sweep funds from another account you have with us. We may use subsequent deposits,\nincluding direct deposits of social security or other government benefits, to cover such overdrafts.\nPayment types - Some, but not necessarily all, of the ways you can access the funds in your account include debit card transactions,\nautomated clearing house (ACH) transactions, and check transactions. All these payment types can use different processing systems and\nsome may take more or less time to post. This information is important for a number of reasons. For example, keeping track of the checks\nyou write and the timing of the preauthorized payments you set up will help you to know what other transactions might still post against your\naccount. For information about how and when we process these different payment types, see the “Payment order of items” subsection\nbelow.\nBalance information - Keeping track of your balance is important. You can review your balance in a number of ways including reviewing\nyour periodic statement, reviewing your balance online, accessing your account information by phone, or coming into one of our branches.\nFunds availability - Knowing when funds you deposit will be made available for withdrawal is another important concept that can help you\navoid being assessed fees or charges. Please see our funds availability disclosure (generally titled, “Your Ability to Withdraw Funds”) for\ninformation on when different types of deposits will be made available for withdrawal. For an account to which our funds availability policy\ndisclosure does not apply, you can ask us when you make a deposit when those funds will be available for withdrawal. An item may be\nreturned after the funds from the deposit of that item are made available for withdrawal. In that case, we will reverse the credit of the item.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 3 of 20\nWe may determine the amount of available funds in your account for the purpose of deciding whether to return an item for insufficient funds\nat any time between the times we receive the item and when we return the item or send a notice in lieu of return. We need only make one\ndetermination, but if we choose to make a subsequent determination, the account balance at the subsequent time will determine whether\nthere are insufficient available funds.\nA temporary debit authorization hold affects your account balance - On debit card purchases, merchants may request a temporary\nhold on your account for a specified sum of money when the merchant does not know the exact amount of the purchase at the time the card\nis authorized. The amount of the temporary hold may be more than the actual amount of your purchase. Some common transactions where\nthis occurs involve purchases of gasoline, hotel rooms, or meals at restaurants. When this happens, our processing system cannot\ndetermine that the amount of the hold exceeds the actual amount of your purchase. This temporary hold, and the amount charged to your\naccount, will eventually be adjusted to the actual amount of your purchase, but it could be three calendar days, or even longer in some\ncases, before the adjustment is made. Until the adjustment is made, the amount of funds in your account available for other transactions will\nbe reduced by the amount of the temporary hold.\nDUE TO CHANGES IN NEW YORK STATE LAW WE ARE INFORMING YOU OF THE POSTING ORDER OF CHECKS AND SIMILAR\nITEMS\nPayment order of items - The order in which items are paid is important if there is not enough money in your account to pay all of the items\nthat are presented. The payment order can affect the number of items overdrawn or returned unpaid and the amount of the fees you may\nhave to pay. To assist you in managing your account, we are providing you with the following information regarding how we process those\nitems.\nOur policy is to process ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions first-credits first, debits second in the order of lowest to highest for\nthe day on which they are processed. We process preauthorized internal transfers second-in the order the transfer record was initiated by\nyou. We process checks and similar items in the order in which they are received during nightly processing which usually occurs between\n9:00 PM and 10:00 PM. If a check is dishonored for insufficient funds and thereafter smaller checks which could be paid are received, the\nsmaller checks shall be honored within amounts on deposit in the subject account.\nWe process the following transactions in real time as they occur:\n• ATM, Online Banking and telephone transactions, debit PIN or on us items such as teller withdrawals at any Flushing Bank retail\nlocations initiated by you are processed in real-time if there is a sufficient available balance in the account to pay them.\n• Debit Card purchases initiated by you at a merchant as they are received throughout the day.\n• Wire transfer transactions initiated by you the same business day.\n• Bill Pay transactions are processed as they occur during the day for scheduled payments.\nIf a check, item or transaction is presented without sufficient funds in your account to pay it, we may, at our discretion, pay the item (creating\nan overdraft) or return the item for insufficient funds (NSF). We will not charge you a fee for paying an overdraft of an ATM or everyday debit\ncard transaction if this is a consumer account and you have not opted-in to that service. The amounts of the overdraft and NSF fees are\ndisclosed elsewhere, as are your rights to opt into overdraft services for ATM and everyday debit card transactions, if applicable. We\nencourage you to make careful records and practice good account management. This will help you to avoid creating items without sufficient\nfunds.\nBUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND ASSOCIATION ACCOUNTS - Earnings in the form of interest, dividends, or credits will be paid only\non collected funds, unless otherwise provided by law or our policy. You represent that you have the authority to open and conduct business\non this account on behalf of the entity. We may require the governing body of the entity opening the account to give us a separate\nauthorization telling us who is authorized to act on its behalf. We will honor the authorization until we actually receive written notice of a\nchange from the governing body of the entity.\nSTOP PAYMENTS - The rules in this section cover stopping payment of items such as checks and drafts. Rules for stopping payment of\nother types of transfers of funds, such as consumer electronic fund transfers, may be established by law or our policy. If we have not\ndisclosed these rules to you elsewhere, you may ask us about those rules.\nA stop-payment order must be given in the manner required by law and must be received in time to give us a reasonable opportunity to act\non it. Because the most effective way for us to execute a stop-payment order is by using an automated process, to be effective the order\nmust precisely identify the number, date and amount of the item, and the payee. We will honor a stop-payment request by the person who\nsigned the particular item, and, by any other person, even though such other person did not sign the item.\nGenerally, if your stop-payment order is given to us in writing it is effective for six months. Your order will lapse after that time if you do not\nrenew the order in writing before the end of the six-month period. If the original stop-payment order was oral your stop-payment order will\nlapse after 14 calendar days if you do not confirm your order in writing within that time period. We are not obligated to notify you when a\nstop-payment order expires.\nIf you stop payment on an item and we incur any damages or expenses because of the stop payment, you agree to indemnify us for those\ndamages or expenses, including attorneys’ fees. You assign to us all rights against the payee or any other holder of the item. You agree to\ncooperate with us in any legal actions that we may take against such persons. You should be aware that anyone holding the item may be\nentitled to enforce payment against you despite the stop-payment order.\nTELEPHONE TRANSFERS - A telephone transfer of funds from this account to another account with us, if otherwise arranged for or\npermitted, may be made by the same persons and under the same conditions generally applicable to withdrawals made in writing.\nLimitations on the number of telephonic transfers from a savings account, if any, are described elsewhere.\nAMENDMENTS AND TERMINATION - We may amend or delete any term of this agreement. We may also add new terms to this\nagreement. In addition, we may suspend, modify, convert, or terminate a service, convert this account to another account type, or close this\naccount for any reason. For any of these types of changes, we will give you reasonable notice in writing by any reasonable method including\nby mail, by any electronic communication method to which you have agreed, on or with a periodic statement, or through any other method\npermitted by law. If we close the account, we will tender the account balance to you or your agent personally, by mail, or by another agreed\nupon method.\nReasonable notice depends on the circumstances, and in some cases, such as when we cannot verify your identity or we suspect fraud, it\nmight be reasonable for us to give you notice after the change becomes effective. For instance, if we suspect fraudulent activity with respect\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 4 of 20\nto your account, and if we deem it appropriate under the circumstances and necessary to prevent further fraud, we might immediately freeze\nor close your account and then give you notice.\nUnless otherwise indicated in the notice of change, if we have notified you of a change to your account, and you continue to have your\naccount after the effective date of the change, you have accepted and agreed to the new or modified terms. You should review any change in\nterms notice carefully as the notice will provide important information of which you may need to be aware.\nWe reserve the right to waive any term of this agreement. However, such waiver shall not affect our right to enforce the term at a later date.\nIf you request that we close your account, you are responsible for leaving enough money in the account to cover any outstanding items or\ntransactions to be paid from the account. Once any outstanding items or transactions are paid, we will close the account and tender the\naccount balance, if any, to you or your agent personally, by mail, or by another agreed upon method.\nAny items and transactions presented for payment after the account is closed may be dishonored. Any deposits we receive after the account\nis closed may be returned. We will not be liable for any damages for not honoring any such debits or deposits received after the account is\nclosed.\nNote: Rules governing changes in interest rates are provided separately in the Truth-in-Savings disclosure or in another document. In\naddition, for changes governed by a specific law or regulation, we will follow the specific timing and format notice requirements of those laws\nor regulations.\nCORRECTION OF CLERICAL ERRORS - Unless otherwise prohibited by law, you agree, if determined necessary in our reasonable\ndiscretion, to allow us to correct clerical errors, such as obtaining your missing signature, on any account documents or disclosures that are\npart of our agreement with you. For errors on your periodic statement, please refer to the STATEMENTS section.\nNOTICES - Any written notice you give us is effective when we actually receive it, and it must be given to us according to the specific\ndelivery instructions provided elsewhere, if any. We must receive any notice in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it. If a notice\nis regarding a check or other item, you must give us sufficient information to be able to identify the check or item, including the precise\ncheck or item number, amount, date and payee. Notice we give you via the United States Mail is effective when it is deposited in the United\nStates Mail with proper postage and addressed to your mailing address we currently have on file. Notice we give you through your email of\nrecord, or other electronic method to which you agreed, will be treated as delivered to you when sent. Notice to any of you is notice to all of\nyou.\nSTATEMENTS - Your duty to report unauthorized signatures (including forgeries and counterfeit checks) and alterations on\nchecks and other items - You must examine your statement of account with “reasonable care and promptness.” If you discover (or\nreasonably should have discovered) any unauthorized signatures (including forgeries and counterfeit checks) or alterations, you must\npromptly notify us of the relevant facts. As between you and us, if you fail to do either of these duties, you will have to bear the entire loss.\nYour loss could be not only with respect to items on the statement but other items with unauthorized signatures or alterations by the same\nwrongdoer. We lose these protections if you establish that we failed to exercise ordinary care in paying an item with an unauthorized\nsignature or alteration.\nYou agree that the time you have to examine your statement and report to us will depend on the circumstances, but will not, in any\ncircumstance, exceed a total of 14 days from when the statement is first sent or made available to you.\nYou further agree that if you fail to report any unauthorized signatures or alterations in your account within 30 days of when we first send or\nmake the statement available, you cannot assert a claim against us on any items in that statement, and as between you and us the loss will\nbe entirely yours. This 30-day limitation is without regard to whether we used ordinary care. The limitation in this paragraph is in addition to\nthat contained in the first paragraph of this section.\nYour duty to report other errors or problems - In addition to your duty to review your statements for unauthorized signatures and\nalterations, you agree to examine your statement with reasonable promptness for any other error or problem - such as an encoding error or\nan unexpected deposit amount. Also, if you receive or we make available either your items or images of your items, you must examine them\nfor any unauthorized or missing indorsements or any other problems. You agree that the time you have to examine your statement and\nitems and report to us will depend on the circumstances. However, this time period shall not exceed 60 days. Failure to examine your\nstatement and items and report any errors to us within days of when we first send or make the statement available precludes you from\nasserting a claim against us for any errors on items identified in that statement and as between you and us the loss will be entirely yours.\nDuty to notify if statement not received - You agree to immediately notify us if you do not receive your statement by the date you\nnormally expect to receive it. Not receiving your statement in a timely manner is a sign that there may be an issue with your account, such\nas possible fraud or identity theft. Absent a lack of ordinary care by us, a failure to receive your statement in a timely manner does not\nextend the time you have to conduct your review under this agreement.\nACCOUNT TRANSFER - This account may not be transferred or assigned without our prior written consent.\nREIMBURSEMENT OF FEDERAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS - If we are required for any reason to reimburse the federal government for all\nor any portion of a benefit payment that was directly deposited into your account, you authorize us to deduct the amount of our liability to the\nfederal government from the account or from any other account you have with us, without prior notice and at any time, except as prohibited\nby law. We may also use any other available legal remedy to recover the amount of our liability.\nTEMPORARY ACCOUNT AGREEMENT - If the account documentation indicates that this is a temporary account agreement, each\nperson who signs to open the account or has authority to make withdrawals (except as indicated to the contrary) may transact business on\nthis account. However, we may at some time in the future restrict or prohibit further use of this account if you fail to comply with the\nrequirements we have imposed within a reasonable time.\nSETOFF - You each agree that we may (when permitted by law) set off the funds in this account against any due and payable debt any of\nyou owe us now or in the future. If this account is owned by one or more of you as individuals, we may set off any funds in the account\nagainst a due and payable debt a partnership owes us now or in the future, to the extent of your liability as a partner for the partnership\ndebt. If your debt arises from a promissory note, then the amount of the due and payable debt will be the full amount we have demanded, as\nentitled under the terms of the note, and this amount may include any portion of the balance for which we have properly accelerated the due\ndate.\nThis right of setoff does not apply to this account if prohibited by law. For example, the right of setoff does not apply to this account if: (a) it is\nan Individual Retirement Account or similar tax-deferred account, or (b) the debt is created by a consumer credit transaction under a credit\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 5 of 20\ncard plan (but this does not affect our rights under any consensual security interest), or (c) the debtor’s right of withdrawal only arises in a\nrepresentative capacity, or (d) social security or supplemental security income payments are deposited directly into this account pursuant to\nan agreement with us which permits such direct deposit without presentation to you at the time of deposit. We will not be liable for the\ndishonor of any check when the dishonor occurs because we set off a debt against this account. You agree to hold us harmless from any\nclaim arising as a result of our exercise of our right of setoff.\nRESTRICTIVE LEGENDS OR INDORSEMENTS - The automated processing of the large volume of checks we receive prevents us from\ninspecting or looking for restrictive legends, restrictive indorsements or other special instructions on every check. For this reason, we are not\nrequired to honor any restrictive legend or indorsement or other special instruction placed on checks you write unless we have agreed in\nwriting to the restriction or instruction. Unless we have agreed in writing, we are not responsible for any losses, claims, damages, or expenses\nthat result from your placement of these restrictions or instructions on your checks. Examples of restrictive legends placed on checks are\n“must be presented within 90 days” or “not valid for more than $1,000.00.” The payee’s signature accompanied by the words “for deposit only”\nis an example of a restrictive indorsement.\nFACSIMILE SIGNATURES - Unless you make advance arrangements with us, we have no obligation to honor facsimile signatures on\nyour checks or other orders. If we do agree to honor items containing facsimile signatures, you authorize us, at any time, to charge you for\nall checks, drafts, or other orders, for the payment of money, that are drawn on us. You give us this authority regardless of by whom or by\nwhat means the facsimile signature(s) may have been affixed so long as they resemble the facsimile signature specimen filed with us, and\ncontain the required number of signatures for this purpose. You must notify us at once if you suspect that your facsimile signature is being\nor has been misused.\nCHECK PROCESSING - We process items mechanically by relying almost exclusively on the information encoded in magnetic ink along\nthe bottom of the items. This means that we do not individually examine all of your items to determine if the item is properly completed,\nsigned and indorsed or to determine if it contains any information other than what is encoded in magnetic ink. You agree that we have\nexercised ordinary care if our automated processing is consistent with general banking practice, even though we do not inspect each item.\nBecause we do not inspect each item, if you write a check to multiple payees, we can properly pay the check regardless of the number of\nindorsements unless you notify us in writing that the check requires multiple indorsements. We must receive the notice in time for us to have\na reasonable opportunity to act on it, and you must tell us the precise date of the check, amount, check number and payee. We are not\nresponsible for any unauthorized signature or alteration that would not be identified by a reasonable inspection of the item. Using an\nautomated process helps us keep costs down for you and all account holders.\nCHECK CASHING - We may charge a fee for anyone that does not have an account with us who is cashing a check, draft or other\ninstrument written on your account. We may also require reasonable identification to cash a check, draft or other instrument. We can decide\nwhat identification is reasonable under the circumstances and such identification may be documentary or physical and may include\ncollecting a thumbprint or fingerprint.\nINDORSEMENTS - We may accept for deposit any item payable to you or your order, even if they are not indorsed by you. We may give\ncash back to any one of you. We may supply any missing indorsement(s) for any item we accept for deposit or collection, and you warrant\nthat all indorsements are genuine.\nTo ensure that your check or share draft is processed without delay, you must indorse it (sign it on the back) in a specific area. Your entire\nindorsement (whether a signature or a stamp) along with any other indorsement information (e.g. additional indorsements, ID information,\ndriver’s license number, etc.) must fall within 11/ 2” of the “trailing edge” of a check. Indorsements must be made in blue or black ink, so that\nthey are readable by automated check processing equipment.\nAs you look at the front of a check, the “trailing edge” is the left edge. When you flip the check over, be sure to keep all indorsement\ninformation within 11/ 2” of that edge.\nYOUR INDORSEMENT MUST\nBE WITHIN THIS AREA\n7654\nName\nAddress, City, State 20\nPay to the\norder of $\ndollars 1 1/2\" Keep your indorsement\nout of this area.\nBank Name\nand Location\nMemo\n(cid:2)123456789(cid:2) 7654\nFRONT OF CHECK BACK OF CHECK\nTRAILING EDGE\nIt is important that you confine the indorsement information to this area since the remaining blank space will be used by others in the\nprocessing of the check to place additional needed indorsements and information. You agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold us\nharmless for any loss, liability, damage or expense that occurs because your indorsement, another indorsement or information you have\nprinted on the back of the check obscures our indorsement.\nThese indorsement guidelines apply to both personal and business checks.\nDEATH OR INCOMPETENCE - You agree to notify us promptly if any person with a right to withdraw funds from your account(s) dies or is\nadjudicated (determined by the appropriate official) incompetent. We may continue to honor your checks, items, and instructions until: (a)\nwe know of your death or adjudication of incompetence, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that knowledge. You agree\nthat we may pay or certify checks drawn on or before the date of death or adjudication of incompetence for up to ten (10) days after your\ndeath or adjudication of incompetence unless ordered to stop payment by someone claiming an interest in the account.\nFIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS - Accounts may be opened by a person acting in a fiduciary capacity. A fiduciary is someone who is appointed to\nact on behalf of and for the benefit of another. We are not responsible for the actions of a fiduciary, including the misuse of funds. This\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc.

You understand that by merely opening such an account, we are not acting in the\ncapacity of a trustee in connection with the trust nor do we undertake any obligation to monitor or enforce the terms of the trust or letters.\nCREDIT VERIFICATION - You agree that we may verify credit and employment history by any necessary means, including preparation of\na credit report by a credit reporting agency.\nLEGAL ACTIONS AFFECTING YOUR ACCOUNT - If we are served with a subpoena, restraining order, writ of attachment or execution,\nlevy, garnishment, search warrant, or similar order relating to your account (termed \"legal action\" in this section), we will comply with that\nlegal action as required by applicable law. However, nothing in this agreement shall be construed as a waiver of any rights you may have\nunder applicable law with regards to such legal action. Subject to applicable law, we may, in our sole discretion, choose to freeze the assets\nin the account and not allow any payments or transfers out of the account, or take other action as may be appropriate under the\ncircumstances, until there is a final court determination regarding the legal action. We may do these things even if the legal action involves\nless than all of you. In these cases, we will not have any liability to you if there are insufficient funds to pay your items because we have\nwithdrawn funds from your account or in any way restricted access to your funds in accordance with the legal action and applicable law. Any\nfees or expenses we incur in responding to any legal action (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, and our internal expenses) may be\ncharged against your account, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law. The list of fees applicable to your account(s) - provided\nelsewhere - may specify additional fees that we may charge for responding to certain legal actions.\nACCOUNT SECURITY -\nYour duty to protect account information and methods of access - Our policy may require methods of verifying your identity before\nproviding you with a service or allowing you access to your account. We can decide what identification is reasonable under the\ncircumstances. For example, process and identification requirements may vary depending on whether they are online or in person.\nIdentification may be documentary or physical and may include collecting a fingerprint, voiceprint, or other biometric information.\nIt is your responsibility to protect the account numbers and electronic access devices (e.g., an ATM card) we provide you for your accounts.\nYou should also safeguard your username, password, and other access and identifying information when accessing your account through a\ncomputer or other electronic, audio, or mobile device or technology. If you give anyone authority to access the account on your behalf, you\nshould exercise caution and ensure the trustworthiness of that agent. Do not discuss, compare, or share information about your account\nnumbers with anyone unless you are willing to give them full use of your money. An account number can be used by thieves to issue an\nelectronic debit or to encode your number on a false demand draft which looks like and functions like an authorized check. If you furnish\nyour access device or information and grant actual authority to make transfers to another person (a family member or coworker, for\nexample) who then exceeds that authority, you are liable for the transfers unless we have been notified that transfers by that person are no\nlonger authorized. Your account number can also be used to electronically remove money from your account, and payment can be made\nfrom your account even though you did not contact us directly and order the payment.\nYou must also take precaution in safeguarding your blank checks. Notify us at once if you believe your checks have been lost or stolen. If\nyou are negligent in safeguarding your checks we will not be responsible for any losses you incur due to an alteration or forgery if we have\npaid the check in good faith and in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.\nPositive pay and other fraud prevention services - Except for consumer electronic fund transfers subject to Regulation E, you agree that\nif we offer you services appropriate for your account to help identify and limit fraud or other unauthorized transactions against your account,\nand you reject those services, you will be responsible for any fraudulent or unauthorized transactions which could have been prevented by\nthe services we offered. You will not be responsible for such transactions if we acted in bad faith or to the extent our negligence contributed\nto the loss. Such services include positive pay or commercially reasonable security procedures. If we offered you a commercially reasonable\nsecurity procedure which you reject, you agree that you are responsible for any payment order, whether authorized or not, that we accept in\ncompliance with an alternative security procedure that you have selected. The positive pay service can help detect and prevent check fraud\nand is appropriate for account holders that issue a high volume of checks, a lot of checks to the general public, or checks for large dollar\namounts.\nINSTRUCTIONS FROM YOU - Unless required by law or we have agreed otherwise in writing, we are not required to act upon instructions\nyou give us via facsimile transmission, email, voicemail, or phone call to a facsimile number, email address, or phone number not\ndesignated by us for a particular purpose or for a purpose that is unrelated to the request or instruction.\nCLAIM OF LOSS - The following rules do not apply to a transaction or claim related to a consumer electronic fund transfer governed by\nRegulation E (e.g., an every day/one-time consumer debit card or ATM transaction). The error resolution procedures for consumer\nelectronic fund transfers can be found in our initial Regulation E disclosure generally titled, \"Electronic Fund Transfers.\" For other\ntransactions or claims, if you claim a credit or refund because of a forgery, alteration, or any other unauthorized withdrawal, you agree to\ncooperate with us in the investigation of the loss, including giving us an affidavit containing whatever reasonable information we require\nconcerning your account, the transaction, and the circumstances surrounding the loss. You will notify law enforcement authorities of any\ncriminal act related to the claim of lost, missing, or stolen checks or unauthorized withdrawals. We will have a reasonable period of time to\ninvestigate the facts and circumstances surrounding any claim of loss. Unless we have acted in bad faith, we will not be liable for special or\nconsequential damages, including loss of profits or opportunity, or for attorneys’ fees incurred by you.\nYou agree that you will not waive any rights you have to recover your loss against anyone who is obligated to repay, insure, or otherwise\nreimburse you for your loss. You will pursue your rights or, at our option, assign them to us so that we may pursue them. Our liability will be\nreduced by the amount you recover or are entitled to recover from these other sources.\nEARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES (and involuntary withdrawals) - We may impose early withdrawal penalties on a withdrawal from a\ntime account even if you don’t initiate the withdrawal. For instance, the early withdrawal penalty may be imposed if the withdrawal is caused\nby our setoff against funds in the account or as a result of an attachment or other legal process. We may close your account and impose the\nearly withdrawal penalty on the entire account balance in the event of a partial early withdrawal. See your separately provided notice of\npenalty for early withdrawal for additional information.\nCHANGES IN NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION - You are responsible for notifying us of any change in your name, address, or\nother information we use to communicate with you. Unless we agree otherwise, notice of such a change must be made in writing. Informing\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 7 of 20\nus of your address or name change on a check reorder form is not sufficient. We will attempt to communicate with you only by use of the\nmost recent information you have provided to us. If provided elsewhere, we may impose a service fee if we attempt to locate you.\nRESOLVING ACCOUNT DISPUTES - We may place an administrative hold on the funds in your account (refuse payment or withdrawal\nof the funds) if it becomes subject to a claim adverse to (1) your own interest; (2) others claiming an interest as survivors or beneficiaries of\nyour account; or (3) a claim arising by operation of law. The hold may be placed for such period of time as we believe reasonably necessary\nto allow a legal proceeding to determine the merits of the claim or until we receive evidence satisfactory to us that the dispute has been\nresolved. We will not be liable for any items that are dishonored as a consequence of placing a hold on funds in your account for these\nreasons.\nWAIVER OF NOTICES - To the extent permitted by law, you waive any notice of non-payment, dishonor or protest regarding any items\ncredited to or charged against your account. For example, if you deposit an item and it is returned unpaid or we receive a notice of\nnonpayment, we do not have to notify you unless required by federal Regulation CC or other law.\nTRUNCATION, SUBSTITUTE CHECKS, AND OTHER CHECK IMAGES - If you truncate an original check and create a substitute\ncheck, or other paper or electronic image of the original check, you warrant that no one will be asked to make payment on the original\ncheck, a substitute check or any other electronic or paper image, if the payment obligation relating to the original check has already been\npaid. You also warrant that any substitute check you create conforms to the legal requirements and generally accepted specifications for\nsubstitute checks. You agree to retain the original check in conformance with our policy for retaining original checks. You agree to indemnify\nus for any loss we may incur as a result of any truncated check transaction you initiate. We can refuse to accept substitute checks that have\nnot previously been warranted by a bank or other financial institution in conformance with the Check 21 Act. Unless specifically stated in a\nseparate agreement between you and us, we do not have to accept any other electronic or paper image of an original check.\nREMOTELY CREATED CHECKS - Like any standard check or draft, a remotely created check (sometimes called a telecheck,\npreauthorized draft or demand draft) is a check or draft that can be used to withdraw money from an account. Unlike a typical check or draft,\nhowever, a remotely created check is not issued by the paying bank and does not contain the signature of the account owner (or a signature\npurported to be the signature of the account owner). In place of a signature, the check usually has a statement that the owner authorized the\ncheck or has the owner’s name typed or printed on the signature line.\nYou warrant and agree to the following for every remotely created check we receive from you for deposit or collection: (1) you have received\nexpress and verifiable authorization to create the check in the amount and to the payee that appears on the check; (2) you will maintain\nproof of the authorization for at least 2 years from the date of the authorization, and supply us the proof if we ask; and (3) if a check is\nreturned you owe us the amount of the check, regardless of when the check is returned. We may take funds from your account to pay the\namount you owe us, and if there are insufficient funds in your account, you still owe us the remaining balance.\nUNLAWFUL INTERNET GAMBLING NOTICE - Restricted transactions as defined in Federal Reserve Regulation GG are prohibited\nfrom being processed through this account or relationship. Restricted transactions generally include, but are not limited to, those in which\ncredit, electronic fund transfers, checks, or drafts are knowingly accepted by gambling businesses in connection with the participation by\nothers in unlawful Internet gambling.\nFUNDS TRANSFERS - You agree that this section is governed by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code - Funds Transfers (UCC\n4A) and the terms used in this section have the meaning given to them in UCC 4A.You also agree to be bound by all funds-transfer system\nrules, rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) and their operating circulars, as appropriate. Unless\notherwise required by applicable law, such as Regulation J or the operating circulars of the Board, this section is subject to UCC 4A as\nadopted in the state in which you have your account with us. If any part of this section is determined to be unenforceable, the rest shall\nremain effective. This section controls funds transfers unless supplemented or amended in a separate record. Generally, this section will not\napply to you if you are a consumer. For example, this section generally does not apply to a funds transfer if any part of the transfer is\ngoverned by the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 (EFTA). However, this section does apply to a funds transfer that is a remittance\ntransfer as defined in EFTA unless the remittance transfer is an electronic fund transfer as defined in EFTA. To the extent this section is not\ninconsistent with the EFTA, this section may also apply to a consumer electronic fund transfer sent through the FedNow system or through\nthe Real Time Payments system (RTP) operated by The Clearing House. In addition, even if you are a consumer, this section will apply to\nthat part of any funds transfer that is conducted by Fedwire.\nFunds transfer - A funds transfer is the transaction or series of transactions that begin with the originator’s payment order, made for the\npurpose of making payment to the beneficiary of the order. A funds transfer is completed by the acceptance by the beneficiary’s bank of a\npayment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the originator’s order. Unless otherwise required by the type of funds transfer you are\ninitiating, you may transmit a payment order orally or in a record, but your order cannot state any condition to payment to the beneficiary\nother than the time of payment. Credit entries may be made by ACH.\nAuthorized account - An authorized account is a deposit account you have with us that you have designated as a source of payment of\npayment orders you issue to us. If you have not designated an authorized account, any account you have with us is an authorized account\nto the extent that payment of the payment order is not inconsistent with the use of the account.\nAcceptance of your payment order - We are not obligated to accept any payment order that you give us, although we normally will accept\nyour payment order if you have a withdrawable credit in an authorized account sufficient to cover the order. If we do not execute your\npayment order, but give you notice of our rejection of your payment order after the execution date or give you no notice, we are not liable to\npay you as restitution any interest on a withdrawable credit in a non-interest-bearing account.\nCutoff time - If we do not receive your payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order before our cutoff time on a\nfunds transfer day for that type of order or communication, the order or communication will be deemed to be received at the opening of our\nnext funds transfer business day.\nPayment of your order - If we accept a payment order you give us, we may receive payment by automatically deducting from any\nauthorized account the amount of the payment order plus the amount of any expenses and charges for our services in execution of your\npayment order. We are entitled to payment on the payment or execution date. Unless your payment order specifies otherwise, the payment\nor execution date is the funds transfer date we receive the payment order. The funds transfer is completed upon acceptance by the\nbeneficiary’s bank. Your obligation to pay your payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed, but you are still responsible\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 8 of 20\nto pay us any expenses and charges for our services. However, if you told us to route the funds transfer through an intermediate bank, and\nwe are unable to obtain a refund because the intermediate bank that you designated has suspended payments, then you are still obligated\nto pay us for the payment order. You will not be entitled to interest on any refund you receive because the beneficiary’s bank does not\naccept the payment order.\nSecurity procedure - As described more fully in a separate writing, the authenticity of a payment order or communication canceling or\namending a payment order issued in your name as sender may be verified by a security procedure. You affirm that you have no\ncircumstances which are relevant to the determination of a commercially reasonable security procedure unless those circumstances are\nexpressly contained in a separate writing signed by us. You may choose from one or more security procedures that we have developed, or\nyou may develop your own security procedure if it is acceptable to us. If you refuse a commercially reasonable security procedure that we\nhave offered you, you agree that you will be bound by any payment order issued in your name, whether or not authorized, that we accept in\ngood faith and in compliance with the security procedure you have chosen.\nIdentifying number - If your payment order identifies an intermediate bank, beneficiary bank, or beneficiary by name and number, we and\nevery receiving or beneficiary bank may rely upon the identifying number rather than the name to make payment, even if the number\nidentifies an intermediate bank or person different than the bank or beneficiary identified by name. Neither we nor any receiving or\nbeneficiary bank have any responsibility to determine whether the name and identifying number refer to the same financial institution or\nperson.\nRecord of oral or telephone orders - You agree that we may, if we choose, record any oral or telephone payment order or communication\nof amendment or cancelation.\nNotice of credit - If we receive a payment order to credit an account you have with us, we are not required to provide you with any notice of\nthe payment order or the credit.\nProvisional credit - You agree to be bound by the automated clearing house association operating rules that provide that payments made\nto you or originated by you by funds transfer through the automated clearing house system are provisional until final settlement is made\nthrough a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise payment is made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code.\nRefund of credit - You agree that if we do not receive payment of an amount credited to your account, we are entitled to a refund from you\nin the amount credited and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have paid the amount so credited.\nCancelation or amendment of payment order - You may cancel or amend a payment order you give us only if we receive the\ncommunication of nt before our cutoff time and in time to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it before we accept the payment order.\nThe communication of cancelation or amendment must be presented in conformity with the same security procedure that has been agreed\nto for payment orders.\nIntermediaries - We are not liable for the actions of any intermediary, regardless of whether or not we selected the intermediary. We are\nnot responsible for acts of God, outside agencies, or nonsalaried agents.\nLimit on liability - You waive any claim you may have against us for consequential or special damages, including loss of profit arising out of\na payment order or funds transfer, unless this waiver is prohibited by law. We are not responsible for attorney fees you might incur due to\nerroneous execution of payment order.\nErroneous execution - If we receive an order to pay you, and we erroneously pay you more than the amount of the payment order, we are\nentitled to recover from you the amount in excess of the amount of the payment order, regardless of whether you may have some claim to\nthe excess amount against the originator of the order.\nDuty to report unauthorized or erroneous payment - You must exercise ordinary care to determine that all payment orders or\namendments to payment orders that we accept that are issued in your name are authorized, enforceable, in the correct amount, to the\ncorrect beneficiary, and not otherwise erroneous. If you discover (or with reasonable care should have discovered) an unauthorized,\nunenforceable, or erroneously executed payment order or amendment, you must exercise ordinary care to notify us of the relevant facts.\nThe time you have to notify us will depend on the circumstances, but that time will not in any circumstance exceed 14 days from when you\nare notified of our acceptance or execution of the payment order or amendment or that your account was debited with respect to the order\nor amendment. If you do not provide us with timely notice you will not be entitled to interest on any refundable amount. If we can prove that\nyou failed to perform either of these duties with respect to an erroneous payment and that we incurred a loss as a result of the failure, you\nare liable to us for the amount of the loss not exceeding the amount of your order.\nObjection to payment - If we give you a notice that reasonably identifies a payment order issued in your name as sender that we have\naccepted and received payment for, you cannot claim that we are not entitled to retain the payment unless you notify us of your objection to\nthe payment within one year of our notice to you.\nPLEDGES - Each owner of this account may pledge all or any part of the funds in it for any purpose to which we agree. Any pledge of this\naccount must first be satisfied before the rights of any surviving account owner or account beneficiary become effective. For example, if an\naccount has two owners and one of the owners pledges the account (i.e., uses it to secure a debt) and then dies, (1) the surviving owner’s\nrights in this account do not take effect until the debt has been satisfied, and (2) the debt may be satisfied with the funds in this account.\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY - You may wish to appoint an agent to conduct transactions on your behalf. (We, however, have no duty or\nagreement whatsoever to monitor or insure that the acts of the agent are for your benefit.) This may be done by allowing your agent to sign\nin that capacity on the signature card or by separate form, such as a power of attorney. A power of attorney continues until your death or the\ndeath of the person given the power. If the power of attorney is not “durable,” it is revoked when you become incompetent. We may continue\nto honor the transactions of the agent until: (a) we have received written notice or have actual knowledge of the termination of the authority\nor the death of an owner, and (b) we have had a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice or knowledge. You agree not to hold us\nresponsible for any loss or damage you may incur as a result of our following instructions given by an agent acting under a valid power of\nattorney.\nSTALE-DATED CHECKS - We are not obligated to, but may at our option, pay a check, other than a certified check, presented for\npayment more than six months after its date. If you do not want us to pay a stale-dated check, you must place a stop-payment order on the\ncheck in the manner we have described elsewhere.\n© 2022 Wolters Kluwer Financial Services, Inc. All rights reserved.\nAIB-B 6/1/2022 3q Custom TCM-35Baa,5 202256191-010 Page 9 of 20\nDORMANT ACCOUNTS - Your account will be considered dormant if all of the following occur for three consecutive years: (1) deposits\nare not made to your account; (2) withdrawals are not made to your account; or (3) the bank does not receive any correspondence from you\nwhich indicates that you know that your account with the bank is still in existence. Interest crediting is not considered a deposit for this\npurpose. In accordance with the N.Y. State Abandoned Property Law, dormant funds will be turned over to the State of New York. You may\nsubmit a claim for return of the funds to: New York State Office of the State Comptroller, Office of Unclaimed Funds, 110 State Street,\nAlbany, New York 12236.\nFDIC INSURANCE - Funds in your account(s) with us are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and backed by the\nfull faith and credit of the United States. The amount of insurance coverage you have depends on the number of accounts you have with us\nthat are of different “ownership.” An individual account is one unique form of “ownership”; a joint account, a pay-on-death account, and a self\ndirected qualified retirement account (e.g., an IRA) are examples of some of the others. Deposit insurance for a person’s self directed\nqualified retirement account is up to $250,000. (An IRA is a self directed qualified retirement account as is any account where the owner\ndecides where and how to invest the balance.) Funds are insured to $250,000 per depositor for the total of funds combined in all of your\nother insured accounts with us. If you want a more detailed explanation or additional information, you may ask us or contact the FDIC. You\ncan also visit the FDIC website at www.fdic.gov and click on the Deposit Insurance link. The link includes detailed contact information as\nwell as a deposit insurance estimator.\nUNCLAIMED PROPERTY - The law establishes procedures under which unclaimed property must be surrendered to the state. (We may\nhave our own rules regarding dormant accounts, and if we charge a fee for dormant accounts it will be disclosed to you elsewhere.)\nGenerally, the funds in your account are considered unclaimed if you have not had any activity or communication with us regarding your\naccount over a period of years. Ask us if you want further information about the period of time or type of activity that will prevent your\naccount from being unclaimed. If your funds are surrendered to the state, you may be able to reclaim them, but your claim must be\npresented to the state. Once your funds are surrendered, we no longer have any liability or responsibility with respect to the funds.\nCASH TRANSACTION REPORTING - To help law enforcement agencies detect illegal activities, the law requires all financial institutions\nto gather and report information on some types of cash transactions. If the information we need to complete the report is not provided, we\nare required to refuse to handle the transaction. If you have any questions regarding these rules, the U.S. Treasury Financial Crimes\nEnforcement Network (FinCEN) maintains a frequently asked questions (FAQ) document online. The FAQ also includes additional\ninformation for contacting FinCEN.\nBACKUP WITHHOLDING/TIN CERTIFICATION - Federal tax law requires us to report interest payments we make to you of $10 or\nmore in a year, and to include your taxpayer identification number (TIN) on the report (the taxpayer identification number is your social\nsecurity number if you are an individual). Interest includes dividends, interest and bonus payments for purposes of this rule. Therefore, we\nrequire you to provide us with your TIN and to certify that it is correct. In some circumstances, federal law requires us to withhold and pay\nto the IRS a percentage of the interest that is earned on funds in your accounts. This is known as backup withholding. We will not have to\nwithhold interest payments when you open your account if you certify your TIN and certify that you are not subject to backup withholding\ndue to underreporting of interest. (There are special rules if you do not have a TIN but have applied for one, if you are a foreign person, or\nif you are exempt from the reporting requirements.) We may subsequently be required to begin backup withholding if the IRS informs us\nthat you supplied an incorrect TIN or that you underreported your interest income.\nLOST, DESTROYED, OR STOLEN CERTIFIED, CASHIER’S OR TELLER’S CHECKS - Under some circumstances you may be able to\nassert a claim for the amount of a lost, destroyed, or stolen certified, cashier’s or teller’s check. To assert the claim: (a) you must be the remitter\n(or drawer of a certified check) or payee of the check, (b) we must receive notice from you describing the check with reasonable certainty and\nasking for payment of the amount of the check, (c) we must receive the notice in time for us to have a reasonable opportunity to act on it, and (d)\nyou must give us a declaration (in a form we require) of your loss with respect to the check. You can ask us for a declaration form. Even if all of\nthese conditions are met, your claim may not be immediately enforceable. We may pay the check until the ninetieth day after the date of the\ncheck (or date of acceptance of a certified check). Therefore, your claim is not enforceable until the ninetieth day after the date of the check or\ndate of acceptance, and the conditions listed above have been met. If we have not already paid the check, on the day your claim is enforceable\nwe become obligated to pay you the amount of the check. We will pay you in cash or issue another certified check.\nAt our option, we may pay you the amount of the check before your claim becomes enforceable. However, we will require you to agree to\nindemnify us for any losses we might suffer. This means that if the check is presented after we pay your claim, and we pay the check, you\nare responsible to cover our losses. We may require you to provide a surety bond to assure that you can pay us if we suffer a loss.\nCHANGING ACCOUNT PRODUCTS - We may change your account to another product offered by us at any time by giving you notice\nthat your account will be changed to another product on a specified date. If your account is a time account, the change will not occur before\nthe next maturity date of your account. If you do not close your account before the date specified in the notice, we may change your account\nto that other product on the date specified in the notice.\nTRANSACTIONS BY MAIL - You may deposit checks or drafts by mail. You should indorse the item being sent through the mail with the\nwords “For Deposit Only” and should include your correct account number underneath to ensure the item is credited to the correct account.\nYou should use the pre-encoded deposit slips found in your checkbook. If you do not use your deposit slip or provide us with instructions\nindicating how or where the item should be credited, we may apply it to any account or any loan balance you have with us or we may return\nthe item to you. Receipts for such transactions will be mailed to you only if a self-addressed stamped envelope is provided. Following your\ndeposit, examine your statement carefully or call us to ensure that we received the item. Do not send cash through the mail for deposit.\nCHECK STORAGE AND COPIES - You agree that you will not receive your canceled checks. We will store your canceled checks or\ncopies of them for a reasonable retention period. You may request copies from us in the manner we require.\nINTERNATIONAL ACH TRANSACTIONS - Financial institutions are required by law to scrutinize or verify any international ACH\ntransaction (IAT) that they receive against the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\nThis action may, from time to time, cause us to temporarily suspend processing of an IAT and potentially affect the settlement and/or\navailability of such payments.\nFUNDS TRANSFERS - Unless otherwise required by applicable law, such as Regulation J or the operating circulars of the Board of\nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, this agreement is subject to Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code - Fund Transfers as\nadopted in the state in which you have your account with us.

We may rely on the number even if it identifies a financial institution,\nperson or account other than the one named. You agree to be bound by automated clearing house association and other funds-transfer\nsystem rules, as applicable. These rules provide, among other things, that payments made to you, or originated by you, are provisional\nuntil final settlement is made through a Federal Reserve Bank or payment is otherwise made as provided in Article 4A-403(a) of the\nUniform Commercial Code. If we do not receive such payment, we are entitled to a refund from you in the amount credited to your\naccount and the party originating such payment will not be considered to have paid the amount so credited. Credit entries may be made\nby ACH or other funds-transfer systems. If we receive a payment order to credit an account you have with us by wire or ACH, we are not\nrequired to give you any notice of the payment order or credit.\n—————————————\nMobile Banking - For information about Flushing Bank's Mobile Banking and Mobile Check Deposit, please refer to the Flushing Bank\nOnline Banking Agreement.\n—————————————\nSPECIAL RULES FOR\nNEW ACCOUNTS\nIf you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your account is open.\nFunds from electronic direct deposits to your account will be available on the day we receive the deposit.
