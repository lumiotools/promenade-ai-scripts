(NASDAQ: ULH) today reported consolidated third quarter 2024 net income of $26.5 million, or $1.01 per basic and diluted share, on total operating revenues of $426.8 million. This compares to net income of $23.0 million, or $0.88 per basic and diluted share, during third quarter 2023 on total operating revenues of $421.3 million.\n\n[ ![Universal Logistics Holdings logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Universal Logistics Holdings\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/393905/Universal_Logistics_Holdings_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/393905/Universal_Logistics_Holdings_Logo.html)\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, Universal's operating income increased $5.8 million to $42.6 million, compared to $36.8 million in the third quarter one year earlier. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating margin for the third quarter 2024 was 10.0%, compared to 8.7% during the same period last year. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased $16.2 million during the third quarter 2024 to $72.9 million, compared to $56.7 million one year earlier. As a percentage of operating revenue, EBITDA margin for the third quarter 2024 was 17.1%, compared to 13.5% during the same period last year. In August 2024, Universal ceased operations of its company-managed brokerage business. During the third quarter of 2024, this business unit reported pre-tax losses of approximately $8.6 million, including $2.8 million of non-cash impairment charges. These losses adversely impacted the Company's operating margin by 200 bps and net income by $6.4 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share. Excluding the impact of these charges, the Company's adjusted earnings during the third quarter of 2024 were $1.25 per basic and diluted share. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded total impairment charges of $3.7 million.\n\n\"Universal's diverse service offerings continue to be a strategic advantage, consistently driving stand-out results in our space,\" commented Tim Phillips, Universal's CEO. \"Our contract logistics segment once again delivered outstanding results and remains the key to our success. I am also excited to have recently acquired Parsec, a market-leading provider of rail terminal management services, which allows our contract logistics segment to penetrate new verticals and grow our core logistics service offerings. Our trucking segment also performed well during the quarter and continues to show strong demand for our specialized, heavy-haul solution. While I am pleased with Universal's overall performance, the third quarter wasn't without its challenges. We continue to navigate a deeply depressed freight environment, and we also made the difficult but necessary decision to close our company-managed brokerage operation. We remain committed to making sound business decisions and executing on our strategy to ensure Universal's continued, long-term success.\"\n\n**Segment Information:**\n\n**Contract Logistics**\n\n  * **Third Quarter 2024 Operating Revenues: $245.2 million, 17.8% increase**\n  * **Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $45.6 million, 18.6% operating margin**\n\n\n\nIn the contract logistics segment, which includes our value-added and dedicated services, third quarter 2024 operating revenues increased 17.8% to $245.2 million, compared to $208.1 million for the same period last year.

We present EBITDA and EBITDA margin, each a non-GAAP measure, as supplemental measures of our performance. We define EBITDA as net income plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, and (iv) amortization. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA as a percentage of total operating revenues. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are presenting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP measure. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\n\n**Thirteen Weeks Ended** |  **Thirty-nine Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 28 , 2024** |  **September 30 , 2023** |  **September 28 , 2024** |  **September 30 , 2023**  \n( in thousands) |  ( in thousands)  \n**EBITDA**  \nNet income |  $ |  26,540 |  $ |  23,047 |  $ |  109,731 |  $ |  71,488  \nIncome tax expense |  8,682 |  7,807 |  36,726 |  24,159  \nInterest expense, net |  7,416 |  6,495 |  20,378 |  16,590  \nDepreciation |  25,536 |  16,208 |  73,490 |  47,521  \nAmortization |  4,748 |  3,178 |  14,305 |  9,540  \nEBITDA |  $ |  72,922 |  $ |  56,735 |  $ |  254,630 |  $ |  169,298  \nEBITDA margin (a) |  17.1 |  % |  13.5 |  % |  18.4 |  % |  13.3 |  %  \n(a) EBITDA margin is computed by dividing EBITDA by total operating revenues for each of the periods indicated.  \n  \nWe present EBITDA and EBITDA margin because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.\n\nEBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n  * EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;\n  * Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\n  * Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and only supplementally on EBITDA and EBITDA margin.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=DE39368&sd=2024-10-24) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-logistics-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-declares-dividend-302286545.html>\n\nSOURCE Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc.\n\nFor Further Information: Steven Fitzpatrick, Investor Relations, SFitzpatrick@UniversalLogistics.com\n"

(NASDAQ: ULH) today reported consolidated third quarter 2024 net income of $26.5 million, or $1.01 per basic and diluted share, on total operating revenues of $426.8 million. This compares to net income of $23.0 million, or $0.88 per basic and diluted share, during third quarter 2023 on total operating revenues of $421.3 million.\n\n[ ![Universal Logistics Holdings logo \\(PRNewsfoto/Universal Logistics Holdings\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/393905/Universal_Logistics_Holdings_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/393905/Universal_Logistics_Holdings_Logo.html)\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, Universal's operating income increased $5.8 million to $42.6 million, compared to $36.8 million in the third quarter one year earlier. As a percentage of operating revenue, operating margin for the third quarter 2024 was 10.0%, compared to 8.7% during the same period last year. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased $16.2 million during the third quarter 2024 to $72.9 million, compared to $56.7 million one year earlier. As a percentage of operating revenue, EBITDA margin for the third quarter 2024 was 17.1%, compared to 13.5% during the same period last year. In August 2024, Universal ceased operations of its company-managed brokerage business. During the third quarter of 2024, this business unit reported pre-tax losses of approximately $8.6 million, including $2.8 million of non-cash impairment charges. These losses adversely impacted the Company's operating margin by 200 bps and net income by $6.4 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share. Excluding the impact of these charges, the Company's adjusted earnings during the third quarter of 2024 were $1.25 per basic and diluted share. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded total impairment charges of $3.7 million.\n\n\"Universal's diverse service offerings continue to be a strategic advantage, consistently driving stand-out results in our space,\" commented Tim Phillips, Universal's CEO. \"Our contract logistics segment once again delivered outstanding results and remains the key to our success. I am also excited to have recently acquired Parsec, a market-leading provider of rail terminal management services, which allows our contract logistics segment to penetrate new verticals and grow our core logistics service offerings. Our trucking segment also performed well during the quarter and continues to show strong demand for our specialized, heavy-haul solution. While I am pleased with Universal's overall performance, the third quarter wasn't without its challenges. We continue to navigate a deeply depressed freight environment, and we also made the difficult but necessary decision to close our company-managed brokerage operation. We remain committed to making sound business decisions and executing on our strategy to ensure Universal's continued, long-term success.\"\n\n**Segment Information:**\n\n**Contract Logistics**\n\n  * **Third Quarter 2024 Operating Revenues: $245.2 million, 17.8% increase**\n  * **Third Quarter 2024 Operating Income: $45.6 million, 18.6% operating margin**\n\n\n\nIn the contract logistics segment, which includes our value-added and dedicated services, third quarter 2024 operating revenues increased 17.8% to $245.2 million, compared to $208.1 million for the same period last year.

We present EBITDA and EBITDA margin, each a non-GAAP measure, as supplemental measures of our performance. We define EBITDA as net income plus (i) interest expense, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, and (iv) amortization. We define EBITDA margin as EBITDA as a percentage of total operating revenues. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis.\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of Regulation G issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are presenting the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the comparable GAAP measure. Set forth below is a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA for each of the periods indicated:\n\n**Thirteen Weeks Ended** |  **Thirty-nine Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 28 , 2024** |  **September 30 , 2023** |  **September 28 , 2024** |  **September 30 , 2023**  \n( in thousands) |  ( in thousands)  \n**EBITDA**  \nNet income |  $ |  26,540 |  $ |  23,047 |  $ |  109,731 |  $ |  71,488  \nIncome tax expense |  8,682 |  7,807 |  36,726 |  24,159  \nInterest expense, net |  7,416 |  6,495 |  20,378 |  16,590  \nDepreciation |  25,536 |  16,208 |  73,490 |  47,521  \nAmortization |  4,748 |  3,178 |  14,305 |  9,540  \nEBITDA |  $ |  72,922 |  $ |  56,735 |  $ |  254,630 |  $ |  169,298  \nEBITDA margin (a) |  17.1 |  % |  13.5 |  % |  18.4 |  % |  13.3 |  %  \n(a) EBITDA margin is computed by dividing EBITDA by total operating revenues for each of the periods indicated.  \n  \nWe present EBITDA and EBITDA margin because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.\n\nEBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. Some of these limitations are:\n\n  * EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n  * EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debts;\n  * Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\n  * Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n\n\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and EBITDA margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and only supplementally on EBITDA and EBITDA margin.\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=DE39368&sd=2024-10-24) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-logistics-holdings-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-declares-dividend-302286545.html>\n\nSOURCE Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc.\n\nFor Further Information: Steven Fitzpatrick, Investor Relations, SFitzpatrick@UniversalLogistics.com\n"
