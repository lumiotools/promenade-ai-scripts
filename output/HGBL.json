The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than could be obtained absent these disclosures. The Company’s use of\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin is not meant to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, any GAAP financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial\nmeasures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. Adjusted EBITDA Margin (see Slide 11)\nrepresents Adjusted EBITDA / Revenue.\n12 Heritage Global Inc. | www.hginc.com\nRoss Dove, CEO\nrdove@hginc.com\nLegacy of Asset Solutions"

All of the discussion and analysis in\nthis report should be read with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 1. Business.\nOverview and History\nWe are an asset services company specializing in financial and industrial asset transactions. We provide a full suite of services\nincluding market making, acquisitions, refurbishment, dispositions, valuations and secured lending. We focus on identifying, valuing,\nacquiring and monetizing underlying tangible assets across more than twenty-five global sectors. We act as an advisor, as well as a\nprincipal, acquiring or brokering turnkey manufacturing facilities, surplus industrial machinery and equipment, industrial inventories,\nand charged-off receivable portfolios.\nOur operations are organized into two divisions, Industrial Assets and Financial Assets. Within these two divisions, we group\nour business activities into the following four operating segments to manage performance:\nIndustrial Assets Division\n(cid:149) Auction and Liquidation – Through our subsidiary Heritage Global Partners, Inc. (“HGP”), we operate a global full-\nservice auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, including the acquisition of turnkey manufacturing facilities and used\nindustrial machinery and equipment.\n(cid:149) Refurbishment & Resale – Through our subsidiary Heritage ALT LLC (“ALT”), we acquire, refurbish and supply\nspecialized laboratory equipment.\nFinancial Assets Division\n(cid:149) Brokerage – Through our subsidiary National Loan Exchange, Inc. (“NLEX”), we broker charged-off receivables in the\nUnited States and Canada on behalf of lenders including banks, mortgage companies, and auto and alternative lending\nsources.\n(cid:149) Specialty Lending – Through our subsidiary Heritage Global Capital LLC (“HGC”), we provide specialty financing\nsolutions to investors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios.\nCorporate Information\nHG was incorporated in Florida in 1983 under the name “MedCross, Inc.” Our name was changed to “I-Link Incorporated” in\n1997, to “Acceris Communications Inc.” in 2003, to “C2 Global Technologies Inc.” in 2005, to “Counsel RB Capital Inc.” in 2011,\nand to Heritage Global Inc. in 2013. The most recent name change more closely identifies HG with its auction and liquidation and\nspecialty lending segments.\nOur corporate headquarters are located at 12625 High Bluff Drive, Suite 305, San Diego, CA 92130. Our telephone number is\n(858) 847-0659 and our corporate website is www.hginc.com.\nThe organization chart below outlines our basic domestic corporate structure as of December 31, 2023.\n3\nHeritage Global Inc.\n(Florida) (1)\n100% 100% 100% 100%\nHeritage Global National Loan Heritage Global\nHeritage Global LLC\nPartners, Inc. Exchange, Inc. Capital LLC\n(Delaware) (3)\n(California) (2) (Illinois) (5) (Delaware) (6)\n100%\nHeritage ALT\nLLC\n(Delaware) (4)\n(1) Registrant.\n(2) Auction and Liquidation.\n(3) Holding Company.\n(4) Refurbishment & Resale.\n(5) Brokerage.\n(6) Specialty Lending.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 82 total and full-time employees, broken down by segment as follows: 33 are employed by\nHGP, 16 by NLEX, 22 by ALT, 5 by HGC and 6 by HG.\nIndustry and Competition\nOur business consists primarily of the auction, appraisal, refurbishment and asset advisory services provided by our Industrial\nAssets division and the charged-off receivable brokerage and specialty financing services provided by our Financial Assets division,\neach of which is further described below. Our business also includes the purchase and sale, including at auction, of industrial\nmachinery and equipment, real estate, inventories, charged-off receivable and distressed debt. The market for all of these services and\nassets is highly fragmented. To acquire auction or appraisal contracts, or assets for resale, we compete with other liquidators, auction\ncompanies, dealers and brokers. We also compete with them for potential purchasers and lenders. Some competitors have significantly\ngreater financial and marketing resources and name recognition.\nWe believe that our business is positioned to grow in all economic cycles. As the economy encounters situations of recession,\nflattening yield curves and rising credit costs, our business may experience wider margins on principal asset sales, a favorable lending\ncycle for charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios, higher volumes of nonperforming assets and building surplus inventories\nand bankruptcies. In times of economic growth, our business has demonstrated its ability to experience growth based on our\ncompetitive advantages in the industry, including our domain expertise related to deal sourcing and execution capabilities, our\ndiversification of integrated service platforms and our experience across underserved markets. We intend to continue to leverage our\ncompetitive advantages to grow within each segment and across platforms through increasing synergies, maintaining high incremental\nmargins, improving earnings predictability, strengthening financial metrics reflected on our balance sheet and managing expenses.\nOur business strategy in the Specialty Lending and Auction and Liquidation segments includes the option of partnering with one or\nmore additional purchasers or lenders, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively,\n“Joint Ventures”). These Joint Ventures give us access to more opportunities, helping to mitigate some of the competition from the\nmarket’s larger participants and contribute to our objective to be the leading resource for clients requiring financial and industrial asset\nsolutions.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe we have attributes that differentiate us from our competitors and provide us with significant competitive advantages.\nOur key competitive strengths are described below.\n4\nDifferentiated Business Model. We believe we have diversified business lines serving the financial and industrial asset\nliquidation market. We have multiple revenue streams including our brokerage, principal based auction services, refurbishment and\nresale, advisory services and secured lending services. Further, our business is event-driven and we have repeat, forward-flow\ncontracts in place with industry leading customers. We expect to drive growth in our revenue streams by taking different roles, and\nusing partners as needed.\nCompelling Macro Growth Drivers. Historically, recessions drive an increased supply of surplus assets and increased demand\nfor liquidation services, which we believe we are well-positioned to provide. Further, consumer lending and charge-off rates are\nexpected to continue their upward trend (currently the highest in over a decade), which we believe will drive an increased supply of\nnon-performing consumer loans. Additionally, we believe an active market for mergers and acquisitions in manufacturing industries\ndrives demand for industrial asset liquidations and our services. The market in which we operate is highly fragmented, presenting a\ncontinued opportunity for the Company to increase market share and drive consolidation.\nHigh Return on Invested Capital. We believe we have an opportunity to drive improved auction economics by serving more\nfrequently in the role of principal rather than the lower margin role of broker. Further, we believe we have a strong growth opportunity\nin providing secured loans to our financial asset debt buyers, a service we are providing through HGC.\nStrong Management Team. We have built an experienced executive-level management team with deep domain expertise. Our\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, Ross Dove, is a third-generation auctioneer and a pioneering innovator in applying technology\nto the asset liquidation industry. Mr. Dove began his career in the auction business over forty years ago, beginning with a small\nfamily-owned auction house and helping to expand it into a global firm, DoveBid, which was sold to a third party in 2008. In addition,\nour senior management team has deep domain expertise in both industrial asset and financial asset transactions. On September 17,\n2020, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Kirk Dove, the former President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company.\nUpon his resignation, Kirk Dove continued his employment with us in an advisory capacity, and is expected to do so until December\n31, 2024. Also, during 2020, Nick Dove was appointed as President, Industrial Assets division, and David Ludwig was appointed as\nPresident, Financial Assets division. Nick Dove previously served as Executive Vice President of Sales of Heritage Global Partners\nsince August 2017. David Ludwig previously served as President of NLEX, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and has\nserved in such capacity since the Company acquired NLEX in 2014.\nFinancial Assets Division\nOur Financial Assets division provides services to issuers of consumer credit that are looking to monetize nonperforming and\ncharged-off loans — loans that creditors have written off due to failure to pay. Nonperforming and charged-off loans typically\noriginate from banks that issue unsecured consumer credit.\nBrokerage Segment\nThrough NLEX, we act as an advisor for sales of charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios via an electronic auction\nexchange platform for banks and other debt holders throughout the United States and Canada. Since the 1980s, NLEX has sold over\n$200 billion face value of performing, nonperforming and charged-off assets. NLEX sales are concentrated in online, automotive,\ncredit card, secured and unsecured consumer and business loan and real estate charge-offs. The typical credit we broker sells at a deep\ndiscount to face value, and we typically receive a commission for these services from both buyers and sellers. We have existing\nrelationships with high quality, top-tier and mid-tier debt buyers. In addition to its banking relationships, NLEX has continued to be\nopportunistic as new lending facilities, such as FinTech, peer-to-peer and more recently Buy Now Pay Later lenders have expanded\nthe availability of consumer credit. Together with growing volume in this industry, due to large increases in delinquency and charge-\noff rates, we anticipate significant growth opportunities in our brokerage segment as these sectors evolve. Given many of our clients'\nlimited resources in this space, we have also implemented post-sale support, further entrenching NLEX with our dedicated clients as\nwell as differentiating us from competitors.\nSpecialty Lending Segment\nThrough HGC, we provide specialty financing solutions to investors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios. Since\nthe inception of HGC in 2019, we have issued $148.9 million in total loans to investors through both self-funded loans and in\npartnership with senior lenders. Our portion of the total loans funded since inception is $62.9 million. Our income from secured\nlending consists of upfront fees, interest income, monthly monitoring fees and backend profit share. In general, we expect to earn an\nannual rate of return on our share of notes receivable outstanding of approximately 20% or more based on established terms of the\nloans funded and performance of collections.\nOur management team has decades of domain expertise with the ability to leverage extensive funding activity and widespread\nindustry relationships. We believe we have the opportunity for growth through increased penetration of the underserved market of\nmid-tier buyers of charged-off receivables, providing more economic financing options and a greater variety of funding solutions to\nour customers.\n5\nSpecialty Lending - Concentration and credit risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, we held a gross balance of investments in notes receivable of $38.4 million, recorded in both notes\nreceivable and equity method investments. Our portfolio includes one borrower’s notes receivable balance of approximately $23.8\nmillion, representing 62% of our total notes receivable as of December 31, 2023, down from 70% as of December 31, 2022. We do\nnot intend to hold highly concentrated balances due from one borrower as part of our long-term strategy but will in the short term have\nconcentration risk on our path to an established and diversified portfolio.\nWe do not evaluate concentration risk solely based on balance due from specific borrowers, but also consider the number of\nportfolio purchases, type of charged off accounts within the portfolio, and the seller of the portfolio when determining the overall risk.\nOf the balance due from one borrower of $23.8 million, there are 11 distinct loan agreements, the underlying portfolio of accounts are\ndiversified throughout FinTech loans, installment loans and credit card accounts, and further diversified amongst six separate sellers\nof these charged off portfolios.\nWe mitigate this concentration risk by requiring, and monitoring, security from each borrower consisting of their charged off\nand nonperforming receivable portfolios. We engage in a due diligence process that leverages our valuation expertise, knowledge and\nexperience in the underlying nonperforming receivable portfolios marketplace. In the event of default, we are entitled to call the\nunpaid interest and principal balances and receive all net collections directly. We may also recover our investment by engaging a third\nparty to collect on the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolio or the underlying portfolio can be sold through\nour Brokerage segment. In certain cases, our recovery options may be subject to concurrence of the originator or other prior holder of\nthe assets.\nFrom inception of the specialty lending segment through December 31, 2023, we have not incurred actual credit losses.\nLoan Restructuring\nIn November 2023, our subsidiary, HGC and its affiliated joint ventures restructured loans with our largest borrower, which was\nexperiencing financial difficulty, by restructuring certain outstanding loans (the \"Restructured Loans\") with an amortized cost basis of\n$51.6 million or 59% of the amortized cost basis of the total charged-off asset portfolio loans of HGC and its affiliated joint ventures.\nOur share of the Restructured Loans at amortized cost basis is $22.2 million, or 57% of HGC’s share of the loan book. On our\nfinancial statements, $8.4 million is classified as notes receivable and $13.8 million is classified as equity method investments.\nAll Restructured Loans were modified by term extension, adding a weighted average of 1.5 years to the life of the Restructured\nLoans, which reduced the monthly payments for the borrower. HGC closely monitors the loans and the borrower’s financial condition\nand evaluates the borrower and loans for credit risk on a quarterly basis.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we increased our allowance for credit losses related to our largest borrower experiencing financial\ndifficulty. This resulted in an allowance for credit losses on the loans later restructured of $1.0 million as of September 30, 2023. We\nreevaluated the potential credit loss related to the Restructured Loans again at year-end and as of December 31, 2023, our allowance\nfor credit losses related to the Restructured Loans was $1.1 million, of which $0.4 million was classified as notes receivable and $0.7\nmillion was recorded within equity method investments.\nIndustrial Assets Division\nOur Industrial Assets division advises enterprise and financial customers on the sale of industrial assets mostly from surplus and\nsometimes distressed circumstances while acting as an agent, guarantor or principal in the sale.\nAuction and Liquidation Segment\nThrough HGP, we offer a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, including the acquisition of turnkey\nmanufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment. The fees for our services typically range from 15–50%,\ndepending on our role and the transaction. This division predominantly targets sellers of surplus or distressed “inside the building”\nassets. Our buyers consist of both end-users and dealers.\nRefurbishment & Resale Segment\nThrough ALT, we have specialized our offering in the biotech and pharma sectors, which have been key verticals over the past\ndecade. ALT focuses on refurbishing and reselling laboratory equipment.\n6\nOur management team has decades of domain expertise with the ability to leverage extensive industry relationships, real time\naccess to databases of buyers and sales, as well as a deep understanding of the underlying asset value across the more than 25\nindustrial sectors in which we operate. We believe we have the opportunity for growth in our auction services through our ability to\nsecure ongoing contracts with large multinational sellers, to be a first mover in emerging sectors, and to gain market share in sectors in\nwhich we are currently less active. Our extensive network and ability to find and source new opportunities are key factors for\nexpansion. We believe we have the opportunity for growth in our valuation services through the addition of incremental bank-\napproved vendor lists, geographic expansion and through deeper penetration with our existing bank relationships.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to federal, state and local consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of customer non-\npublic information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. Many jurisdictions also regulate “auctions” and\n“auctioneers” and may regulate online auction services. These consumer protection laws and regulations could result in substantial\ncompliance costs and could interfere with the conduct of our business.\nLegislation in the United States has increased public companies’ regulatory and compliance costs as well as the scope and cost\nof work provided by independent registered public accountants and legal advisors. As regulatory and compliance guidelines continue\nto evolve, we may incur additional costs in the future, which may or may not be material, in order to comply with legislative\nrequirements or rules, pronouncements and guidelines by regulatory bodies.\nAvailable Information\nWe file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including annual reports on Form 10-K,\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports. The SEC maintains an Internet\nsite at http://www.sec.gov that contains the reports and information statements and other information we file electronically. The\ndocuments that we file under Canadian securities law are available on SEDAR at the following address: http//sedar.com. Our website\naddress is www.hginc.com. Through our website, we make available, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly\nreports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section\n13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practical after we\nelectronically file or furnish such materials to the SEC. Please note that our website address is provided as an inactive textual\nreference only. The information provided on our website is not part of this report, and is therefore not incorporated by reference unless\nsuch information is specifically referenced elsewhere in this report.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn connection with the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we are including the\nfollowing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could significantly and adversely affect the Company and cause\nactual results to differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. The\nrisks and uncertainties described below should be considered carefully, and with all the other information contained in this Report, in\nevaluating the Company and its business. You should carefully consider and evaluate these risk factors, as any of them could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, which, in turn, can adversely affect the\nprice of our securities.\nCompetition and Economic Risks\nWe face significant competition in our business.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain a continuous supply of auction or appraisal contracts, or distressed\nand surplus assets for profitable resale to third parties. In this regard, we compete with numerous other organizations, some of which\nare much larger and better-capitalized, with greater resources available for both asset acquisition and associated marketing to potential\ncustomers. Additionally, some competitors have a longer history of activity in the business and may have advantages with respect to\naccessing both deals and capital.\nOur business is subject to inventory risk and credit risk.\nUnder our business model, when not acting solely as an auctioneer, we assume the general and physical inventory and credit\nrisks associated with purchasing assets for subsequent resale. Although we do enter into transactions for which a subsequent purchaser\nhas already been identified, in most cases we purchase assets and assume the risk that they may sell for less than our forecasted price.\nFurther, we may miscalculate demand or resale value and subsequently sell the assets for less than their original purchase price. Either\nsituation could have a material adverse effect upon our use of working capital and our results of operations.\n7\nOur Specialty Lending segment may be concentrated.\nA significant portion of our Specialty Lending loan portfolio may at any time be concentrated with a small number of\nborrowers. Our Specialty Lending loan portfolio includes a notes receivable balance of approximately $23.8 million from one\nborrower, representing 62% of our total notes receivable as of December 31, 2023. Concentration with a small number of borrowers\nexposes us to the risk that financial difficulty with a single borrower or a small number of borrowers can materially affect our\nbusiness, financial conditions or operating results.\nOur Specialty Lending segment depends on the expertise, efforts and financial health of our borrowers.\nThe ability of our borrowers to repay the loans we make to them depends on the ability of our borrowers to collect the charged\noff receivables purchased with the proceeds of these loans in accordance with their projections, which in turn requires our borrowers\nto properly evaluate the collectability of the charged off receivables as well as the costs of collection. If our borrowers' collection\nmodel forecasts are incorrect, or if unanticipated market conditions cause our borrowers' evaluations to be incorrect, our business,\nfinancial conditions and operating results could be negatively affected.\nOur Specialty Lending segment depends on the ability of our borrowers to purchase charged off receivables at favorable prices.\nPortfolios of charged off receivables fluctuate in price and volume, according to both the availability of new charged off\nreceivables and the demand for these receivables. If our borrowers are unable to purchase a sufficient volume of charged off\nreceivables, or to purchase charged off receivables at a favorable price, our business, financial conditions and operating results could\nbe negatively affected.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuation.\nOur revenue and operating results are subject to fluctuation from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the nature of the\nbusiness, which involves discrete deals of varying size that are very difficult to predict. The timing of revenue recognition related to\nsignificant transactions can materially affect quarterly and annual operating results. Despite the accompanying variability of direct\ncosts, quarterly fixed costs that are largely composed of salaries and benefits could exceed our gross profit. There can therefore be no\nassurance that we can sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The adverse effect of these issues could be increased due to\nconcentration of our revenue, at times, with one or more major customers. This concentration of customers and revenue affects our\noverall risk profile, since a significant portion of our customers would be similarly affected by changes in economic, political,\nregulatory, and other industry conditions. An abrupt or unforeseen change in conditions in these industries could adversely affect\ndemand for our services, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOperational and Governmental Risks\nWe are subject to the risks associated with managing growth.\nSince the establishment of our business in 2009, we have experienced significant growth including through acquisitive\ntransactions and organic expansion. This growth requires an increased investment in personnel, systems and facilities. In the absence\nof continued revenue growth, our operating margins could decline from current levels. Additional acquisitions will be accompanied by\nsuch risks as exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired businesses, unexpected acquisition expenses, greater than anticipated\ninvestments in personnel, systems and facilities, the expense of integrating new and existing operations, diversion of senior\nmanagement resources, and dilution to existing stockholders. Failure to anticipate and manage these risks could have a material\nadverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nA portion of our business is conducted through Joint Ventures.\nConducting business through Joint Ventures, as described above under “Industry and Competition,” allows us to participate in\nsignificantly larger deals than those we could fund independently. If we ceased entering into Joint Ventures, or our Joint Venture\npartners decide not to partner with us, the pool of potential transactions would be reduced. Further, upon entering into Joint Ventures,\nwe become exposed to the uncertainties of the activities of our partners. This could negatively impact our ability to obtain a\ncontinuous supply of assets for resale, and could have a material adverse effect upon our use of working capital and our results of\noperations.\nWe are dependent upon key personnel.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the knowledge, skills and performance of several of our executive officers,\nparticularly our Chief Executive Officer and President, President of Financial Assets and President of Industrial Assets. The loss of\nany of these officers could damage key relationships and result in the loss of essential information and expertise. As our operations\nexpand, we will be required to hire additional employees and may face competition for them. Therefore, either the loss of the services\nof the above existing officers, or the inability to attract and retain appropriately skilled new employees, could have a material adverse\neffect upon our business and results of operations.\n8\nDisruptions to information systems and those of certain third-party service providers utilized by us could adversely impact our\noperations, reputation and brand.\nThe protection of client, employee and company data is extremely important to us. The regulatory environment surrounding\ninformation security and privacy is becoming increasingly demanding and frequently changing in the jurisdictions in which we do\nbusiness. Clients and employees have expectations that we will protect their information from cyber-attacks and other security\nbreaches. We have implemented systems and processes that are designed to protect personal and company information and to prevent\ndata losses, however, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and our systems may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches\nsuch as viruses, hacking, and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions. As part of our information systems infrastructure, we\nrely increasingly upon third-party service providers to perform services related to our services. Any failure on our part or by these\nthird-party service providers to maintain the security of our confidential data and our client and employee personal information could\nresult in business disruption, damage to reputation, financial obligations, lawsuits, sizable fines and costs, and loss of employee and\nclient confidence in our Company, and thus could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition, and\nadversely affect our results of operations. A significant security breach could require future expenditures to implement additional\nsecurity measures to protect against new privacy threats or to comply with state, federal and international laws aimed at addressing\nthose threats.\nThe auction portion of our business may be subject to a variety of additional costly government regulations.\nMany states and other jurisdictions have regulations governing the conduct of traditional “auctions” and the liability of\ntraditional “auctioneers” in conducting auctions, which may also apply to online auction services. In addition, certain states have laws\nor regulations that expressly apply to online auction services. We may incur additional costs in the future to comply with these laws\nand could be subject to fines or other penalties for any failure to comply with these laws. We may be required to make changes in our\nbusiness to comply with these laws, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenue, and cause us to prohibit the listing of certain\nitems, or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or operating results.\nCertain categories of merchandise that we sell are subject to government restrictions.\nWe sell merchandise, such as scientific instruments, that is subject to export control and economic sanctions laws, among other\nlaws, imposed by the United States and other governments. Such restrictions include the U.S. Export Administration regulations, the\nInternational Traffic in Arms regulations, and economic sanctions and embargo laws administered by the Office of the Foreign Assets\nControl regulations. These restrictions prohibit us from, among other things, selling property to (1) persons or entities that appear on\nlists of restricted or prohibited parties maintained by the United States or other governments or (2) countries, regimes, or nationals that\nare the target of applicable economic sanctions or other embargoes.\nWe may incur significant costs or be required to modify our business to comply with these requirements. If we are alleged to\nhave violated any of these laws or regulations we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions,\nincluding termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing\nbusiness with U.S. federal government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of\nimpropriety are made against us, whether or not true.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).\nWe are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper\npayments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Failure to comply with the FCPA could subject us to,\namong other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to environmental risk.\nOur business at times includes the purchase and resale of buildings and land. Although our purchase process includes due\ndiligence to determine that there are no material adverse environmental issues, it is possible that such issues could be discovered\nsubsequent to a completed purchase. Any remediation and related costs could have a material adverse effect upon our business and\nresults of operations.\n9\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretations, or becoming subject to additional foreign, U.S. federal, state or local taxes, could\nnegatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including U.S. federal and state taxes. Changes in tax laws or their interpretations\ncould decrease the amount of earnings we retain, the value of any tax loss carry forwards and tax credits recorded on our balance sheet\nand the amount of our cash flow, and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority, which could increase our tax liabilities. If\nwe are required to pay additional taxes, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our effective tax rate, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our\nfinancial results or prevent fraud.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with\nadequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved\ncontrols, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any\ntesting by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or any\nsubsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial\nreporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements\nor identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence\nin our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nCapitalization and General Market Risks\nWe may require additional financing in the future, which may not be available, or may not be available on favorable terms.\nWe may need additional funds to finance the operations of our business, to make additional investments, to expand our\nSpecialty Lending segment, or to acquire complementary businesses or assets. We may be unable to generate these funds from our\noperations. If funds are not available, or not available on acceptable terms, we could experience a material adverse effect upon our\nbusiness.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and Florida or certain other state laws could delay or prevent a change in control of\nour company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the “Articles”), and Restated Bylaws and anti-takeover provisions of\nthe Florida Business Corporation Act (“FBCA”), could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control of the Company,\nwhich could adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions may also have the effect of making it more difficult for\nthird parties to replace our current management without the consent of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Board”).\nProvisions in our Articles and Restated Bylaws that could delay or prevent an unsolicited change in control include:\n(cid:149) a staggered board of directors;\n(cid:149) limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n(cid:149) the authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued\nwithout stockholder approval.\nThe Company is a Florida corporation and is therefore subject to certain anti-takeover provisions that apply to public\ncorporations under Florida law. Pursuant to Section 607.0901 of the FBCA, a publicly held Florida corporation may not engage in a\nbroad range of extraordinary corporate transactions with an interested shareholder within three years of when the shareholder became\nan interested shareholder without the approval of the holders of two-thirds of the voting shares of the corporation (excluding shares\nheld by the interested shareholder), unless, among other exceptions:\n(cid:149) the transaction is approved by a majority of disinterested directors;\n(cid:149) the interested shareholder has owned at least 80% of the corporation’s outstanding voting shares for at least three years\npreceding the announcement date of any such extraordinary corporate transaction;\n(cid:149) the interested shareholder is the beneficial owner of at least 90% of the outstanding voting shares of the corporation, exclusive\nof shares acquired directly from the corporation in a transaction not approved by a majority of the disinterested directors; or\n(cid:149) the consideration paid to the holders of the corporation’s voting stock is at least equal to certain fair price criteria.\n10\nSubject to certain exceptions, an interested shareholder is defined as a person who beneficially owns more than 15% of a\ncorporation’s outstanding voting shares. Although permitted by the FBCA, we have not elected in our Articles to opt out of the terms\nof Section 607.0901. This statutory provision may prevent takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for\nshares of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors may issue additional shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur Articles authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $10.00 par value per share. Of the 10,000,000\nshares of preferred stock authorized under our Articles, the Company has designated 20,000 shares as Series N Preferred Stock. There\nare 563 shares of Series N Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. Our Board is authorized to determine the rights and preferences of\nany additional series or class of preferred stock. Our Board may, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with\ndividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that are senior to our shares of common stock or that could adversely affect\nthe voting power or other rights of the existing holders of outstanding shares of preferred stock or common stock. The issuance of\nadditional shares of preferred stock may also hamper or discourage an acquisition or change in control of the Company.\nWe may conduct future offerings of our common stock and preferred stock that may diminish our investors’ pro rata ownership\nand depress our stock price.\nOur Articles authorize us to issue shares of our preferred stock, common stock or securities convertible into common stock for\nthe consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, including at prices\ndiffering from the price of the common stock previously issued. We could issue a significant number of shares of common stock in the\nfuture in connection with investments or acquisitions. Any of these issuances could dilute our existing stockholders, and such dilution\ncould be significant. Moreover, such dilution could have a material adverse effect on the market price for the shares of our common\nstock.\nThe future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of\nshares of our common stock, either by diluting the voting power of our common stock if the preferred stock votes together with the\ncommon stock as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a\nseparate class vote, even if the action were approved by the holders of our shares of our common stock.\nThe future issuance of shares of additional preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other\neconomic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our common stock by making\nan investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors in common stock may not wish to purchase common stock\nat a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would\neffectively be entitled to purchase common stock at the lower conversion price, causing economic dilution to the holders of common\nstock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market has recently experienced significant price and\nvolume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of all securities, including securities of companies like us. The market price\nof our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n(cid:149) our operating and financial performance;\n(cid:149) variances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;\n(cid:149) the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n(cid:149) we have a relatively small base of registered shares of common stock that could result in significant stock price movements\nupward or downward based on low levels of trading volume in our common stock;\n(cid:149) future sales of common stock or debt or the perception that sales could occur;\n(cid:149) investor perception of our business and our prospects;\n(cid:149) developments relating to the occurrence of risks impacting our company, including any of the risk factors set forth herein; or\n(cid:149) general economic and stock market conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or\ndisproportionate to the operating performance of companies in our industry. These broad market and industry factors may materially\nreduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class-action litigation\nhas often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We may\nbecome involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our\nmanagement team’s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business.\n11\nWe have a material amount of goodwill which, if it becomes impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired. Current accounting standards require that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based on\nthe fair value of the reporting unit. As of December 31, 2023 approximately 9% of our total assets represents goodwill. Declines in our\nprofitability or the value of comparable companies may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down\nof goodwill and a reduction in net income.\nWe may not be able to utilize income tax loss carry forwards.\nRestrictions in our ability to utilize income tax loss carry forwards have occurred in the past due to the application of certain\nchanges in ownership tax rules in the United States. There is no certainty that the application of these rules may not recur. In addition,\nfurther restrictions of, reductions in, or expiration of net operating loss and net capital loss carry forwards may occur through future\nmerger, acquisition and/or disposition transactions or through failure to continue a significant level of business activities. Any such\nadditional limitations could require us to pay income taxes in the future and record an income tax expense to the extent of such\nliability. We could be liable for income taxes on an overall basis while having unutilized tax loss carry forwards since these losses\nmay be applicable to one jurisdiction and/or particular line of business while earnings may be applicable to a different jurisdiction\nand/or line of business. Additionally, income tax loss carry forwards may expire before we have the ability to utilize such losses in a\nparticular jurisdiction and there is no certainty that current income tax rates will remain in effect at the time when we have the\nopportunity to utilize reported tax loss carry forwards. Thus, any net operating loss arising in a taxable year ending before January 1,\n2018 may only be carried forward for 20 taxable years following the taxable year of such loss. Any net operating loss arising in a\ntaxable year ending on or after January 1, 2018 can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, any net operating loss deduction with\nrespect to a net operating loss arising in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 is limited to 80% of our taxable income in\nthe year in which deduction is taken.\nWe have not declared any dividends on our common stock to date and have no expectation of doing so in the foreseeable future.\nThe payment of cash dividends on our common stock rests within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend,\namong other things, upon our earnings, unencumbered cash, capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant\nfactors. To date, we have not paid dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture. As of December 31, 2023, we do not have any preferred stock outstanding that has any preferential dividends.\nOur executive officers, directors and their affiliates hold a large percentage of our common stock and their interests may differ\nfrom other stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, 12% of our common stock as of March 1,\n2024. If they were to act together, these stockholders would have significant influence over most matters requiring approval by\nstockholders, including the election of directors, any amendments to our Articles of Incorporation and certain significant corporate\ntransactions, including potential merger or acquisition transactions. In addition, without the consent of these stockholders, we could be\ndelayed or prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us or our other investors. These stockholders may take\nthese actions even if they are opposed by our other investors.\nThere is a limited public trading market for our common stock. Our stock price could be extremely volatile and may decline\nsubstantially from the public offering price. As a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for\nthem.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and has a limited public trading market in the United\nStates. Without an active trading market, there can be no assurance regarding the liquidity or resale value of the common stock. In\naddition, the market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Such price fluctuations may be affected by\ngeneral market price movements or by reasons unrelated to our operating performance or prospects such as, among other things,\nannouncements concerning us or our competitors, technological innovations, government regulations, and litigation concerning\nproprietary rights or other matters. Volatility in the market price of our common stock, as well as general economic, market or\npolitical conditions, may prevent a holder of our common stock from being able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for the\nshares and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. Holders of our common stock may experience a\ndecrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or\nprospects, and a holder of our common stock could lose part or all of their investment. The price of our common stock could be\nsubject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors.\n12\nWe could be delisted from Nasdaq, which could seriously harm the liquidity of our stock and our ability to raise capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. However, we cannot\nassure you that our common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future. In order to continue listing our common stock on\nNasdaq, we must maintain certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. Generally, we must maintain a minimum amount in\nstockholders' equity and a minimum number of holders of our common stock.\nIf we cease to be eligible to trade on Nasdaq, the following may occur:\n(cid:149) We may have to pursue trading on a less recognized or accepted market, such as the OTC Bulletin Board or the “pink sheets.”\n(cid:149) The trading price of our common stock could suffer, including an increased spread between the “bid” and “asked” prices\nquoted by market makers.\n(cid:149) Shares of our common stock could be less liquid and marketable, thereby reducing the ability of stockholders to purchase or\nsell our shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically. If our stock is traded as a “penny stock,” transactions in\nour stock would be more difficult and cumbersome.\n(cid:149) We may be unable to access capital on favorable terms or at all, as companies trading on alternative markets may be viewed as\nless attractive investments with higher associated risks, such that existing or prospective institutional investors may be less interested\nin, or prohibited from, investing in our common stock. This may also cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe financial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time consuming and place\nsignificant additional demands on our management.\nThe obligations of being a public company in the United States place additional demands on our management and require\nsignificant expenditures, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act; the rules and\nregulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protection Act; and the listing requirements for Nasdaq. Our management and other personnel devote a\nsubstantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with these requirements. Moreover, despite reforms made possible by the\nJumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 and the 2015 Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act, the reporting requirements,\nrules, and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and\ncostly, particularly if we were no longer to qualify as a smaller reporting company. Any changes that we make to comply with these\nobligations may not be sufficient to allow us to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis, or at all.\nThese rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance,\nand we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar\ncoverage. These factors also could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of\nDirectors, particularly to serve on our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, or as executive officers.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\n13\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nWe place a high priority on securing confidential business information and the personal information we receive and store about\nour customers and employees. Our cybersecurity risk management is based on recognized cybersecurity industry frameworks and\nstandards, including those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which we use, together with information collected\nfrom internal assessments, to develop policies for use of our information assets (for example, mobile phones and personal computers)\nand protection of personal information. We protect these information assets through techniques such as multifactor authentication and\nmalware defenses. We also work with internal stakeholders across the company to integrate foundational cybersecurity principles\nthroughout our organization’s operations, including restricting access to information based on business need. We utilize an\nestablished, nationally recognized cloud-services provider to maintain and manage our data with the exception of certain highly\nsensitive information, which we maintain in separate designated systems with enhanced security controls. In addition, we contract a\nthird-party IT consultant with over twenty years of experience, who manages the core information technology functions of the\nbusiness including coordinating with our cloud-services provider, implementing new processes, monitoring of our network for cyber\nthreats, and other information technology administrative responsibilities. Throughout the year, we train our employees on\ncybersecurity awareness, confidential information protection and perform simulated phishing attacks. In addition to the processes,\ntechnologies, and controls that we have in place to reduce the likelihood of a material cybersecurity incident (or series of related\ncybersecurity incidents), we have developed a written incident response plan outlining how to address cybersecurity events that occur.\nThe plan sets forth the steps for coordination among various corporate functions and governance groups and serves as a framework for\nthe execution of responsibilities across businesses and operational roles. The incident response plan is designed to help us coordinate\nactions to prepare for, detect, respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents, and includes processes to triage, assess severity,\nescalate, contain, investigate, and remediate the incident, as well as to assess the need for disclosure and comply with applicable legal\nobligations. We also maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to help us cover certain costs\nassociated with cybersecurity incidents and information system failures. To date, we have not experienced a material cybersecurity or\ninformation security breach.\nOversight responsibility in this area is shared by management, the Board, and its Corporate Governance Committee. To prevent,\ndetect and respond to information security threats more effectively, the Company has established a Management Cybersecurity\nCommittee (MCC) consisting of the Chief Financial Officer, the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, the Chief\nMarketing Officer, business unit leaders, the third-party IT consultant, and other internal and external IT resources. The MCC\nregularly reports to the Corporate Governance Committee, which in turn reports to the Audit Committee and the Board. The Board\nalso receives an annual update from our senior leadership on cybersecurity and information security matters. The Corporate\nGovernance Committee regularly briefs the Board on these matters, and the Board also receives periodic briefings on cyber threats to\nenhance our directors’ awareness on cybersecurity and information security issues.\nItem 2. Properties.\nWe lease or rent office space in several locations in the United States. The principal locations are Del Mar, CA, Hayward, CA,\nand San Diego, CA, which are related to HGP’s operations, and Edwardsville, IL, which is related to NLEX’s operations. The\nEdwardsville office is leased from a related party, as discussed in Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. We own a\nwarehouse and office space East Lyme, CT, which is related to our ALT operations.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are involved in various legal matters arising out of our operations in the normal course of business, none of which are\nexpected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot Applicable.\n14\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nShares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share, are quoted under the symbol “HGBL” on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nHolders\nAs of March 1, 2024, we had approximately 338 holders of common stock of record.\nDividends\nTo date, we have not paid dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture. As of December 31, 2023, we do not have any preferred stock outstanding that has any preferential dividends.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities.\nThe Company did not sell any of its securities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 that were not registered under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, repurchases of the Company's common stock were as follows:\n(c) Total (d)\nNumber of Approximate\nShares Dollar Value\nPurchased as of Shares that\n(b) Part of May Yet Be\n(a) Total Average Publicly Purchased\nNumber of Price Announced Under the\nShares Paid per Plans or Plans or\nPeriod Purchased [1] Share [2] Programs Programs [3]\nOctober 1 through October 31, 2023 — $ — — $ —\nNovember 1 through November 30, 2023 — $ — — $ —\nDecember 1 through December 31, 2023 152,707 $ 2.62 396,175 $ 3,207,096\n[1] No shares of our common stock were purchased other than through a publicly announced plan or\nprogram.\n[2] Amounts in this column reflect weighted average price paid per share, which includes commissions and\nother expenses associated with the repurchases.\n[3] This column reflects the approximate dollar value of shares of our common stock that are available for\npurchase under the $4.0 million repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on May 5, 2022\n(“2022 Repurchase Program”). The 2022 Repurchase Program expires in June 2025.\nItem 6. [Reserved].\n15\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes\nthereto, included in “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules” of this Report. Our accounting policies have the potential\nto significantly impact our financial statements, either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate,\nor because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring, at a specific point in time, events that\nare continuous in nature.\nBusiness Overview, Recent Developments and Outlook\nPlease see “Item 1. Business” of this Report for an overview of our business and recent developments. Please see “Item 1A.\nRisk Factors” of this Report for a discussion of the risk factors that may impact our current and future operations, and financial\ncondition.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2023, we had working capital of $11.6 million, as compared to working capital of $7.7 million at December\n31, 2022, an increase of $3.9 million.\nOur current assets increased to $26.3 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $23.9 million at December 31, 2022. The\nchange in our current assets was primarily due to an increase in the current portion of notes receivable of $2.1 million, accounts\nreceivable of $0.9 million, and inventory of $0.5 million, offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $0.4 million and other\ncurrent assets of $0.7 million.\nOur current liabilities decreased to $14.7 million at December 31, 2023 as compared to $16.2 million at December 31, 2022.\nThe decrease of $1.5 million is primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.7 million and the current\nportion of third party debt of $1.7 million, offset by an increase in payables to sellers of $1.8 million.\nWe believe we can fund our operations and our debt service obligations during 2024 and beyond through a combination of cash\nflows from our on-going operations and accessing financing from our existing line of credit.\nOur indebtedness consists of a promissory note dated August 23, 2021 (the “ALT Note”) issued in the amount of $2.0 million as\npart of the aggregate purchase price paid to acquire certain assets and liabilities of American Laboratory Trading, any amounts\nborrowed under the promissory note, business loan agreement, commercial security agreement and pledge agreement (the “2021\nCredit Facility”) with C3bank, National Association, for a $10.0 million revolving line of credit, and the Term Loan (as defined\nbelow). The terms of the ALT Note require us to pay off the Note in 48 equal installments of approximately $44,000 with an interest\nrate of 3% per annum and a maturity date of August 23, 2025. As of December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $0.9\nmillion on the ALT Note.\nOn May 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Reaffirmation of Loan (the “Modification\nAgreement”), by and between the Company and C3 Bank. The Modification Agreement modifies and reaffirms the 2021 Credit\nFacility to, among other things, extend the maturity date, modify the applicable interest rate, and further modify the loan covenants.\nThe maturity date was modified to October 27, 2024. We are permitted to use the proceeds of the loan solely for our business\noperations. As of December 31, 2023, we had no outstanding balance on the 2021 Credit Facility.\nOn May 26, 2023, the Company entered into a promissory note, a business loan agreement and commercial security agreement\n(collectively, the “2023 Credit Facility”) with C3 Bank. The 2023 Credit Facility provides for a new $7.0 million term loan (the \"Term\nLoan\"). The Company is permitted to use the proceeds of the Term Loan solely for its business operations. The maturity date of the\nTerm Loan is April 27, 2028. The Term Loan sets the interest rate spread and interest rate floor to accrue at a variable interest rate,\nwhich is based on the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the “prime rate,” plus a margin of 0.25% and a floor of\nno less than 6.5%. The Term Loan requires we pay monthly installments over a 5-year term with adjustments for changes in the\nvariable interest rate. As of December 31, 2023, we had an outstanding balance of $6.3 million on the Term Loan.\nDuring 2023, our primary source of cash was the cash on hand, proceeds from the Term Loan and cash provided by our\noperating activities. Cash disbursements during 2023 consisted primarily of investments in notes receivable net of cash received on\ntransfer of notes to partners of $21.0 million, equity method investments of $17.2 million, repayment on our 2021 Credit Facility of\n$8.9 million, repayment on our ALT Note of $0.5 million, repayment on our Term Loan of $0.7 million, payment of operating\nexpenses, and settlement of auction liabilities.\nWe expect that future net cash flows from our operating activities will continue to be the primary source of cash required to fund\nour ongoing operations for the foreseeable future.\n16\nOwnership Structure and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had stockholders’ equity of $61.1 million and $48.3 million, respectively.\nWe determine our future capital and operating requirements based upon our current and projected operating performance and\ncontractual commitments. We expect to be able to finance our future operations through a combination of working capital, future net\ncash flows from operating activities, our 2021 Credit Facility and Term Loan. Our contractual requirements are limited to the\noutstanding debt and lease commitments with related and unrelated parties. Capital requirements are generally limited to our\npurchases of surplus and distressed assets and our investment activity under our Specialty Lending segment. We believe that our\ncurrent capital resources, including available borrowing capacity from our 2021 Credit Facility and Term Loan, are sufficient for these\nrequirements. In the event additional capital is needed, we believe we can obtain additional debt financing through capital partners.\nCash Position and Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 were $12.3 million compared to $12.7 million at December 31, 2022.\nCash provided by operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $13.0 million during 2023 as compared to\n$6.5 million during 2022. The approximate $6.5 million change was primarily attributable to a change of $8.6 million in net income\nadjusted for noncash items during 2023 as compared to 2022, which includes significant changes of a $5.9 million change in earnings\nfrom equity method investments and a $5.4 million change in deferred taxes, offset by a $3.0 million decrease in net income. The\namount was offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.0 million during 2023 as compared to 2022.\nThe significant changes in operating assets and liabilities during 2023 as compared to 2022 are primarily due to the nature of our\noperations. We earn revenue from discrete auction and liquidation deals that vary considerably with respect to their magnitude and\ntiming, and that can consist of fees, commissions, asset sale proceeds, or a combination of all. The operating assets and liabilities\nassociated with such transactions are therefore subject to the same variability and can be different at the end of any given period.\nCash used in investing activities. Cash used in investing activities during 2023 was $15.9 million, as compared to cash used in\ninvesting activities of $7.5 million during 2022.\nCash used in investing activities during 2023 consisted primarily in investment in notes receivable of $29.8 million and equity\nmethod investments of $17.2 million. Cash used in investing activities during 2023 was offset by cash provided by investing activities\nprimarily of cash received on transfer of notes receivable to partners of $8.9 million, payments received on notes receivable of $11.9\nmillion as well as return of investment and cash distributions received from equity method investments of $10.7 million.\nCash used in investing activities in 2022 of $7.5 million was attributable to our investment in equity method investments of\n$14.6 million, which $12.2 million related to activity within our Specialty Lending segment, $1.4 million directly related to the\nacquisition of two pharmaceutical plants, by KNFH LLC, a joint venture, and $1.0 million investment in DHC8 LLC. In addition, we\nused $8.4 million in funding our investment in notes receivable.\nCash used in investing activities during 2022 was offset by cash provided by investing activities of $15.8 million, which\nconsisted primarily of payments received on notes receivable of $3.4 million, return of investment of $5.3 million and cash\ndistributions received from equity method investments of $7.0 million, of which included $0.7 million related to specialty lending\nactivity within our Financial Assets division, $3.8 million from the sale of the remaining real estate assets of CPFH LLC, the joint\nventure, located in Huntsville, Alabama, and $2.5 million from the sales of real estate and machinery and equipment assets of KNFH\nLLC.\nCash provided by financing activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $2.5 million during 2023, as compared to cash\nprovided by financing activities of $0.1 million during 2022.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2023 of $2.5 million was primarily attributable to $13.0 million in proceeds from draws\non our 2021 Credit Facility and Term Loan, offset by $8.9 million in repayments to our 2021 Credit Facility, $0.7 million in\nrepayments to our Term Loan, $0.5 million in repayments to our ALT Note, as well as repurchase of our common stock under our\n2022 Repurchase Program of approximately $0.4 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2022 of $0.1 million was primarily attributable $2.9 million in proceeds from draws on\nour 2021 Credit Facility, offset by aggregate repayment of debt payable to third parties of $2.4 million and repurchase of our common\nstock under our 2022 Repurchase Program of approximately $0.4 million.\nManagement’s Discussion of Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations (in thousands):\n17\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenues:\nServices revenue $ 39,480 $ 23,419\nAsset sales 21,065 23,495\nTotal revenues 60,545 46,914\nOperating costs and expenses:\nCost of services revenue 8,007 4,654\nCost of asset sales 12,724 16,256\nSelling, general and administrative 26,040 21,326\nDepreciation and amortization 514 536\nTotal operating costs and expenses 47,285 42,772\nEarnings of equity method investments 1,059 6,978\nOperating income 14,319 11,120\nInterest expense, net (324) (113)\nIncome before income tax expense (benefit) 13,995 11,007\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 1,520 (4,486)\nNet income $ 12,475 $ 15,493\nOur revenue has several components: (1) traditional fee based asset disposition services, such as commissions from on-line and\nwebcast auctions, liquidations and negotiated sales, and commissions from the NLEX charged-off receivables business, (2) the\nacquisition and subsequent disposition of distressed and surplus assets, including industrial machinery and equipment and real estate,\nand (3) fees and interest earned for appraisal, management advisory services and specialty lending services.\nWe report segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach designates the internal\nreporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of our reportable segments. We manage\nour business primarily on differentiated revenue streams for services offered. Our reportable segments consist of the Auction and\nLiquidation segment, Refurbishment & Resale segment, Brokerage segment, and Specialty Lending segment. Our Auction and\nLiquidation segment, through HGP, operates as a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm, including the\nacquisition of turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment. Our Refurbishment & Resale segment,\nthrough ALT, acquires, refurbishes and supplies specialized laboratory equipment. Our Brokerage segment, through NLEX, brokers\ncharged-off receivables in the U.S. and Canada on behalf of financial institutions. Our Specialty Lending segment, through HGC,\nprovides specialty financing solutions to investors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios.\nWe evaluate the performance of our reportable segments based primarily on operating income. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nthe reported segment operating income for ALT and HGC represents incremental costs for managing these segments as part of their\nsister segments (HGP for ALT and NLEX for HGC). As such, the reported operating income for ALT and HGC does not represent\ntheir true standalone contribution, as we do not attempt to allocate existing fixed divisional overhead costs of the sister divisions to the\nnewer segments. Similarly, corporate overhead cost is not allocated to the operating divisions for management reporting purposes.\nFurther, we do not utilize segmented asset information to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments and do not include\nintercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\n18\nThe following table sets forth operating income information for the Company's reportable segments (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nIndustrial Assets Division:\nAuction and Liquidation $ 4,918 $ 7,979\nRefurbishment & Resale 2,847 1,187\nTotal divisional operating income 7,765 9,166\nFinancial Assets Division:\nBrokerage 8,946 4,709\nSpecialty Lending 1,862 1,213\nTotal divisional operating income 10,808 5,922\nCorporate & other operating loss (4,254) (3,968)\nConsolidated operating income $ 14,319 $ 11,120\n2023 Compared to 2022\nRevenues and cost of revenues – Revenues were $60.5 million in 2023 as compared to $46.9 million in 2022 and costs of\nservices revenue and asset sales were $20.7 million in 2023 compared to $20.9 million in 2022. This resulted in gross profit of $39.8\nmillion in 2023 compared to $26.0 million in 2022, an increase of approximately $13.8 million or approximately 53%. The increased\ngross profit in the current year reflects the significant improvement in performance of our core business segments and increased\nvolume in the financial assets division from both the brokerage and specialty lending segments.\nSelling, general and administrative expense – Selling, general and administrative expense was $26.0 million in 2023 as\ncompared to $21.3 million in 2022, an increase of $4.7 million or 22%. As compared to 2022 there was an increase in selling, general\nand administrative expense during 2023 primarily due to increased compensation expense as a result of improved performance across\nour segments and increased headcount.\nSignificant components of selling, general and administrative expense were as shown below (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022 % change\nCompensation:\nAuction and Liquidation $ 6,502 $ 6,380 2%\nRefurbishment & Resale 2,314 1,601 45%\nBrokerage 6,217 4,911 27%\nSpecialty Lending 1,030 659 56%\nCorporate & other 2,357 2,061 14%\nStock-based compensation 776 540 44%\nConsulting 98 108 -9%\nBoard of Directors fees 322 308 5%\nAccounting, tax and legal professional fees 1,696 1,200 41%\nInsurance 540 467 16%\nOccupancy 1,285 1,105 16%\nTravel and entertainment 831 683 22%\nAdvertising and promotion 604 448 35%\nInformation technology support 436 383 14%\nProvision for credit losses 530 — 100%\nOther 502 472 6%\nTotal selling, general and administrative expense $ 26,040 21,326 22%\n19\nDepreciation and amortization expense – Depreciation and amortization expense in each of the years ended 2023 and 2022\nwas $0.5 million and consisted almost entirely of amortization expense related to intangible assets. In both years the depreciation of\nproperty, plant and equipment was not material.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements – We had no off-balance sheet arrangements during the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWe monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures on a regular basis in order to track our underlying operational\nperformance and trends. Other than operating income (a GAAP financial measure as shown in our consolidated income statements),\nwhich we believe is the most important measure of our operational performance and trends, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted\nEBITDA (non-GAAP financial measures) are key performance indicators (“KPIs”) for our business. These KPIs may not be defined\nor calculated in the same way as similar KPIs used by other companies.\nWe prepared our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We define EBITDA as net income plus\ndepreciation and amortization, interest expense, and provision for income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA reflects EBITDA adjusted further\nto eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation. Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in assessing the Company’s\nresults, evaluating the Company’s performance and in reaching operating and strategic decisions. Management believes that the\npresentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, when considered together with our GAAP financial statements and the reconciliation\nto the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is useful in providing investors a more complete understanding of the\nfactors and trends affecting the underlying performance of the Company on a historical and ongoing basis. Our use of EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA is not meant to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, any GAAP\nfinancial measure. You should carefully evaluate the financial information below, which reconciles our GAAP reported net income to\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (in thousands).\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet income $ 12,475 $ 15,493\nAdd back:\nDepreciation and amortization 514 536\nInterest expense, net 324 113\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 1,520 (4,486)\nEBITDA 14,833 11,656\nManagement add back:\nStock based compensation 776 540\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 15,609 $ 12,196\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\nIn 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASU 2016-13”), which applies a current\nexpected credit loss model, which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The expected\ncredit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, is recorded through an allowance account that is deducted from, or added to,\nthe amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance\nsheet at the amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the current accounting model for loans and debt securities\nacquired with deteriorated credit quality under ASC Topic 310-30, Receivables – Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with\nDeteriorated Credit Quality, which provides authoritative guidance for the accounting of our notes receivable. With respect to smaller\nreporting companies, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including\ninterim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings on January 1,\n2023 of $0.3 million, and established an expected credit loss reserve against our receivables related to loans outstanding, including\nthose held within equity method investments. The increase is a result of changing from an “incurred loss” model, which encompasses\nallowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an “expected loss” model, which encompasses allowances\nfor losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was $1.7\nmillion, with $0.1 million classified as accounts receivable, $0.7 million classified as notes receivable and $0.9 million classified as\nequity method investments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions. Our critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most\nsignificant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\n20\nRevenue recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and ASC\nTopic 310, Receivables (“ASC 310”).\nServices revenue generally consists of commissions and fees from providing auction services, appraisals, brokering of sales\ntransactions, and secured lending. Asset sales revenue generally consists of proceeds obtained through sales of purchased assets. With\nthe exception of revenue generated within our Specialty Lending segment, revenue is recognized for both services revenue and asset\nsales revenue based on the ASC 606 standard recognition model, which consists of the following: (1) an agreement exists between two\nor more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations, (2) the performance obligations are clearly identified, (3) the\ntransaction price has been determined, (4) the transaction price has been properly allocated to each performance obligation, and (5) the\nentity satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer for each of the entities.\nAll services and asset sales revenue from contracts with customers consists of three of our reportable segments: Auction and\nLiquidation, Refurbishment & Resale, and Brokerage segments. Generally, revenue is recognized at the point in time in which the\nperformance obligation has been satisfied and full consideration is received. The exception to recognition at this point in time occurs\nwhen certain contracts provide for advance payments recognized over a period of time. Services revenue recognized over a period of\ntime is not material in comparison to total revenues (less than 1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023), and\ntherefore not reported on a disaggregated basis. Further, as certain contracts stipulate that the customer make advance payments,\namounts not recognized within the reporting period are considered deferred revenue and our “contract liability”. As of December 31,\n2023, the deferred revenue balance was $0.5 million. The deferred revenue balance is primarily related to customer deposits on asset\nsales within our Refurbishment & Resale segment. We record receivables in certain situations based on timing of payments for\nAuction and Liquidation transactions held at the end of the reporting period; however, revenue is generally recognized in the period\nthat we satisfy the performance obligation and cash is collected. We do not record a “contract asset” for partially satisfied performance\nobligations.\nFor auction services and brokerage sale transactions, funds are typically collected from buyers and are held by us on the seller's\nbehalf. The funds are included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We release the funds to the seller, less\nour commission and other fees due, after the buyer has accepted the goods. The amount of cash held on behalf of the sellers is\nrecorded as payables to sellers in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe evaluate revenue from Auction and Liquidation and Brokerage segment transactions in accordance with the accounting\nguidance to determine whether to report such revenue on a gross or net basis. We have determined that we act as an agent for our fee\nbased transactions and therefore we report the revenue from transactions in which we act as an agent on a net basis.\nWe also earn income through transactions that involve us acting jointly with one or more additional purchasers or lenders,\npursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively, “Joint Ventures”). For these transactions,\nin which our ownership share meets the criteria for the equity method investments under ASC Topic 323, Equity Method and Joint\nVentures (“ASC 323”), we do not record revenue or expense. Instead, our proportionate share of the net income (loss) is reported as\nearnings of equity method investments. In general, the Joint Ventures apply the same revenue recognition and other accounting\npolicies as the Company.\nThrough our Specialty Lending segment, we provide specialty financing solutions to investors in charged-off and\nnonperforming asset portfolios. We recognize revenue generated by lending activity in accordance with ASC 310. Fees collected in\nrelation to the issuance of loans includes loan origination fees, interest income, portfolio monitoring fees, and a backend profit share\npercentage related to the underlying asset portfolio.\nThe loan origination fees are offset with any direct origination costs and are deferred upon issuance of the loan and amortized\nover the lives of the related loans, as an adjustment to interest income. The interest method is used to arrive at a periodic interest cost\n(including amortization) that will represent a level effective rate on the sum of the face amount of the debt and (plus or minus) the\nunamortized premium or discount and expense at the beginning of each period.\nThe monitoring fees and the backend profit share are considered a separate earnings process as compared to the origination fees\nand interest income. Monitoring fees are recorded at the agreed upon rate, and at the moment in which payments are made by the\nborrower. The backend profit share is recognized in accordance with the agreed upon rate at the time in which the amount is realizable\nand earned. The recognition policy was established due to the uncertainty of timing of the amount of backend profit share that will be\nrealized.\nNotes receivable, net\nOur notes receivable balance consists of loans to buyers of charged-off receivable portfolios, which is considered the only loan\ncategory or segment to be reported under the applicable accounting guidance. These loans are measured at historical costs and\nreported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans and allowance for\ncredit losses. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income\nover the lives of the related loans.\n21\nWe adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial\nInstruments (“ASC 326”) on January 1, 2023, which requires the application of a credit loss model based prospectively on current\nexpected credit losses (CECL). Under ASC 326, we elected to evaluate notes receivable as a single pool, for individual notes\nreceivable and borrowers with similar risk characteristics. Notes receivable and borrowers that do not share risk characteristics are\nevaluated on an individual basis. Management estimates the allowance for credit losses using relevant available information from\ninternal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As we lack historical\ninternal data, we observe that our notes receivable are similar in character to transactions undertaken by smaller banking institutions.\nWe elect to base our estimation of expected credit losses on the Scaled Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) Allowance Loss\nEstimator (\"SCALE rate\") available from the Federal Reserve, which was 1.3231% as of January 1, 2023. To reflect the cumulative\neffects of the adoption of ASC 326, we recorded the allowance for credit losses and an increase to accumulated deficit of $0.2 million\non the January 1, 2023 consolidated balance sheet, and balance of the allowance for credit losses was therefore $0.2 million as of\nJanuary 1, 2023.\nIn order to evaluate the need for an adjustment to the receivable balance related to credit losses, or impairment, we perform a\nreview of all outstanding loan receivables on a quarterly basis to determine if any indicators exist that suggest the loan will not be\nfully recoverable. As of December 31, 2023, the SCALE rate increased to 1.4183% and our credit loss rate specific to notes receivable\nwas 3.6%. The increase over the SCALE rate was due to both risks with the concentrated balance and declining collections industry-\nwide. As of December 31, 2023, we have recorded an allowance for credit losses related to notes receivable outstanding of $0.7\nmillion.\nSee Note 2 and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nEquity Method Investments\nAs noted above, we conduct a portion of our business through Joint Ventures. Transactions in which our ownership share meets\nthe criteria for the equity method investments under ASC 323 are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby our\nproportionate share of the Joint Venture’s net income (loss) is reported in the consolidated income statement as earnings of equity\nmethod investments. At the balance sheet date, our investments in these Joint Ventures are reported in the consolidated balance sheet\nas equity method investments. We monitor the value of each Joint Ventures’ underlying assets and liabilities, and record a write down\nof our investments should we conclude that there has been a decline in the value of the net assets. These investments have historically\nbeen classified as non-current in our consolidated financial statements due to the uncertainties relating to the timing of resale of the\nunderlying assets as a result of the Joint Venture relationship.\nUpon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, we evaluated the receivable balances held by our affiliated joint ventures and\nrecorded an adjustment to reduce earnings from equity method investments by our share of the allowance for credit losses recorded on\nthe joint ventures’ books of $0.2 million. Similar to notes receivable, the loans held by the joint ventures are evaluated on a quarterly\nbasis to determine if an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses is needed. As of December 31, 2023, the SCALE rate increased\nto 1.4183% and the credit loss rate specific to equity method investments was 4.3%. The increase over the SCALE rate was due to\nboth risks with the concentrated balance and declining collections industry-wide. As of December 31, 2023, we have recorded an\nallowance for credit losses related to its equity method investments of $0.9 million.\nSee Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nDeferred income taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the\namounts at which they are carried in the financial statements, based upon the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the\ndifferences are expected to reverse. We periodically assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets, which have been generated by\na history of net operating and net capital losses, and determine the necessity for a valuation allowance that will reduce deferred tax\nassets to the amount expected to be realized. We evaluate which portion of the deferred tax assets, if any, will more likely than not be\nrealized by offsetting future taxable income, taking into consideration any limitations that may exist on our use of our net operating\nand net capital loss carryforwards. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we recorded a reduction to the valuation allowance resulting in a net\ndeferred tax asset balance of approximately $9.4 million as we believe that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of our\nnet operating loss carryforwards will be utilized. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we further reduced the valuation allowance by $2.2,\nresulting in a net deferred tax asset balance of approximately $9.1 million, to align with our updated forecasts. For further discussion\nof our income taxes, see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\n22\nStock-based compensation\nOur stock-based compensation is primarily in the form of options to purchase common shares. The fair value of stock options is\ncalculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the fair value of our stock options is based on a variety\nof factors including, but not limited to, the price of our common stock, the expected volatility of the stock price over the expected life\nof the award and expected exercise behavior. The fair value of the awards is subsequently expensed over the vesting period, net of\nestimated forfeitures. The provisions of our stock-based compensation plans do not require that we settle any options by transferring\ncash or other assets, and therefore we classify the option awards as equity. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for\nfurther discussion of our stock-based compensation.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nAs a Smaller Reporting Company, we are electing scaled reporting obligations and therefore are not required to provide the\ninformation requested by this Item.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOur consolidated financial statements required by this Item are included herein, commencing on page F-1.\nItem 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, we had no disagreements with our auditors and no\nreportable events.\nOn August 9, 2022, Baker Tilly US, LLP (“Baker Tilly”) notified the Company that Baker Tilly would resign as the Company’s\nindependent registered public accounting firm effective on August 10, 2022. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the\n“Audit Committee”) accepted the resignation of Baker Tilly. During the interim period beginning January 1, 2022 through August 10,\n2022, there were no (i) disagreements with Baker Tilly on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement\ndisclosures, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the satisfaction of Baker Tilly, would have\ncaused it to make reference thereto in its reports on the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for such periods; or\n(ii) “reportable events” (as defined under Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).\nOn August 12, 2022, the Company engaged UHY LLP (“UHY”) as its independent registered public accounting firm for the\nCompany’s fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. The decision to engage UHY as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm was approved by the Audit Committee.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Report, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including\nour Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the “Certifying Officers”), we conducted an evaluation of our\ndisclosure controls and procedures. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, the term “disclosure controls\nand procedures” means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed\nby the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the\ntime periods specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls\nand procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the\nExchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including the Certifying Officers, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Certifying Officers have concluded that our disclosure controls\nand procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, in\naccordance with Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our\nmanagement, including the Certifying Officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission.\n23\nOur internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our\nassets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made by us only in accordance\nwith authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection\nof unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on its assessment using these criteria, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2023 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2023, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company adopted or terminated any Rule\n10b5-1 trading arrangements or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (in each case, as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).\nItem 9C.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we\nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,\nan audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matters communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to\naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\non the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets\nAs described in Notes 2 and 13 to the financial statements, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and\nliabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are\ncarried in the financial statements, based upon the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are\nexpected to reverse. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to\nthe amount expected to be realized. We identified the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as a critical audit\nmatter due to the high degree of judgment in projecting the realization of net operating losses.\nF-(cid:20)\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter include the following:\n(cid:149) Obtained an understanding of management’s estimate regarding the valuation allowance including the\nmethod, assumptions, and data used to develop the estimate by reviewing management prepared memo.\n(cid:149) Examined the underlying data used in determining the valuation allowance, including historical\nfinancial data and prior utilization of net operating losses.\n(cid:149) Evaluated the Company’s projections of future taxable income for reasonableness.\n(cid:149) Reviewed tax provision and other disclosures related to the tax provision\nAllowance for Credit Losses over Notes Receivable\nOn January 1, 2023 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments-\nCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which resulted in an adjustment\nto retained earnings on January 1, 2023 of $0.2 million. As described in Notes 2 and 3, the Company has recognized\nan allowance for credit losses for notes receivable of $0.7 million and within the Company’s portion of equity\nmethod investments of $0.9 million (together, “Receivables”). The allowance is a valuation account that is deducted\nfrom the carrying amount of Receivables to present the net amount of Receivables expected to be collected. The\nCompany’s analysis uses a probability weighted cash flow analysis and other qualitative factors to measure the\nallowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023. We identified the cash flow analysis and qualitative factors\napplied to the allowance for credit losses as a critical audit matter as auditing management’s determination of the\nqualitative factors and forecasts required significant auditor judgment.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter include the following:\n(cid:149) Obtained an understanding of management’s estimate regarding the allowance for credit losses\nincluding the method, assumptions, and data used to develop the estimate by reviewing management\nprepared memorandum and analysis.\n(cid:149) Examined the underlying data used in determining the allowance for credit losses, including forecasts of\nfuture collection, as well as historical collection data compared to the related forecasts.\n(cid:149) Evaluated the repayment history for certain borrowers and evaluated future cash flow projections.\n/s/ UHY LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2022.\nWest

INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 – Description of Business and Principles of Consolidation\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Heritage Global Inc. together with its\nsubsidiaries, including Heritage Global Partners, Inc. (“HGP”), National Loan Exchange Inc. (“NLEX”), Heritage\nGlobal LLC (“HG LLC”), Heritage Global Capital LLC (“HGC”), and Heritage ALT LLC (“ALT”). These entities,\ncollectively, are referred to as “HG,” the “Company,” “we” or “our” in these consolidated financial statements.\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles\nin the United States of America (“GAAP”), as outlined in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all\nsubsidiaries over which HG exercises control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been\neliminated upon consolidation.\nThe Company began its operations in 2009 with the establishment of HG LLC. The business was\nsubsequently expanded by the acquisitions of HGP, NLEX, and ALT in 2012, 2014, and 2021 respectively, and the\ncreation of HGC in 2019. As a result, the Company is positioned to provide an array of value-added capital and\nfinancial asset solutions: auction and appraisal services, traditional asset disposition sales, and specialty financing\nsolutions. The Company’s reportable segments consist of Auction and Liquidation, through HGP, Refurbishment &\nResale, through ALT, Brokerage, through NLEX and Specialty Lending, through HGC.\nRepurchase Program\nThe Company’s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program on May 5, 2022 (“2022\nRepurchase Program”), which permits the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of $4.0 million in common\nshares over a three year period ending in June of 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately\n$3.2 million in remaining aggregate dollar value of shares that may be purchased under the program. During the\nyear ended December 31, 2023 there were 152,707 shares repurchased in the open market for approximately $0.4\nmillion and during the year ended December 31, 2022 there were 243,468 shares repurchased in the open market for\napproximately $0.4 million.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts\nof revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical\nexperience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could\ndiffer from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates include the assessment of collectability of revenue recognized and the valuation of\naccounts receivable and notes receivable, inventory, investments, goodwill and intangible assets, liabilities, deferred\nincome tax assets and liabilities including projecting future years’ taxable income, and stock-based compensation.\nThese estimates have the potential to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements, either because of\nthe significance of the financial statement item to which they relate, or because they require judgment and\nestimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring, at a specific point in time, events that are continuous in\nnature.\nF-7\nNature of Business\nThe Company earns revenue both from commission or fee-based services, and from the sale of distressed or\nsurplus assets. With respect to the former, revenue is recognized as the services are provided. With respect to the\nlatter, the majority of the asset sale transactions are conducted directly by the Company and the revenue is\nrecognized in the period in which the asset is sold. Fee based revenue is reported as services revenue, and the\nassociated direct costs are reported as cost of services revenue. At the balance sheet date, any unsold assets which\nthe Company owns are reported as inventory, any outstanding accounts receivable are included in the Company’s\naccounts receivable, and any associated liabilities are included in the Company’s accrued liabilities. Equipment\ninventory is expected to be sold within a year and is therefore classified as a current asset.\nThe remaining asset sale transactions involve the Company acting jointly with one or more additional\npurchasers or lenders, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company agreement (collectively,\n“Joint Ventures”). Transactions in which the Company’s ownership share meets the criteria for the equity method\ninvestments under ASC Topic 323, Equity Method and Joint Ventures (“ASC 323”), are accounted for as equity\nmethod investments, and, accordingly, the Company’s proportionate share of the net income (loss) is reported as\nearnings of equity method investments. At each balance sheet date, the Company’s investments in these Joint\nVentures are reported in the consolidated balance sheet as equity method investments. These investments are\nclassified on the balance sheet as non-current assets due to the uncertainties relating to the timing of resale of the\nunderlying assets as a result of the Joint Venture relationship. The Company monitors the value of the Joint\nVentures’ underlying assets and liabilities and records a write down of its investments if the Company concludes\nthat there has been a decline in the value of the net assets. As the activity of the Joint Ventures involves asset\npurchase/resale transactions, which is similar in nature to the Company’s other activities, the earnings (losses) of the\nJoint Ventures are included in the operating income in the accompanying consolidated income statements.\nThrough HGC, a wholly owned subsidiary of HG, the Company provides specialty financing solutions to\ninvestors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios.\nSpecialty Lending - Concentration and credit risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company held a gross balance of investments in notes receivable of $38.4\nmillion, recorded in both notes receivable and equity method investments. The Company's portfolio includes one\nborrower’s notes receivable balance of approximately $23.8 million, representing 62% of the Company's total notes\nreceivable balance as of December 31, 2023, down from 82% as of December 31, 2022. The Company does not\nintend to hold highly concentrated balances due from any one borrower as part of its long-term strategy but will in\nthe short term have concentration risk on its path to an established and more diversified portfolio.\nThe Company does not evaluate concentration risk solely based on balance due from specific borrowers, but\nalso considers the number of portfolio purchases, type of charged off accounts within the portfolio, and the seller of\nthe portfolio when determining the overall risk. Of the balance due from one borrower of $23.8 million, there are 11\ndistinct loan agreements. The underlying portfolio of accounts are diversified throughout FinTech loans, installment\nloans and credit card accounts, and further diversified amongst six separate sellers of these charged off portfolios.\nThe Company mitigates this concentration risk by requiring, and monitoring, security from each borrower\nconsisting of their charged off and nonperforming receivable portfolios. The Company engages in a due diligence\nprocess that leverages its valuation expertise and knowledge in the underlying nonperforming receivable portfolios\nmarketplace. In the event of default, the Company is entitled to call the unpaid interest and principal balances and\nreceive all net collections directly. The Company may also recover its investment by engaging a third party to\ncollect on the underlying charged off or nonperforming receivable portfolio or the underlying portfolio can be sold\nthrough the Company's Brokerage segment. In certain cases, the Company’s recovery options may be subject to\nconcurrence of the originator or other prior holder of the assets.\nFrom inception of the specialty lending program through December 31, 2023, the Company has incurred no\nactual credit losses.\nF-8\nLoan Restructuring\nIn October 2023, the Company became aware that its largest borrower was experiencing financial difficulty.\nIn November 2023, the Company's subsidiary HGC and its affiliated joint ventures restructured loans with this\nborrower by restructuring certain outstanding loans (the \"Restructured Loans\") with an amortized cost basis of $51.6\nmillion or 59% of the amortized cost basis of the total charged-off asset portfolio loans of HGC and its affiliated\njoint ventures. The Company’s share of the Restructured Loans amortized cost basis is $22.2 million, or 57% of\nHGC’s share of the loan book. On the Company's financial statements, $8.4 million is classified as notes receivable\nand $13.8 million is classified as equity method investments.\nAll Restructured Loans were restructured by term extension, adding a weighted average of 1.5 years to the life\nof the Restructured Loans, which reduced the monthly payments for the borrower. HGC closely monitors the loans\nand the borrower’s financial condition and evaluates the borrower and loans for credit risk on a quarterly basis.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company increased its allowance for credit losses related to its largest\nborrower experiencing financial difficulties. This resulted in an allowance for credit losses on the loans later\nrestructured of $1.0 million as of September 30, 2023. Management reevaluated the potential credit loss related to\nthe Restructured Loans again at year-end and as of December 31, 2023, the Company’s allowance for credit losses\nrelated to the Restructured Loans was $1.1 million, of which $0.4 million was classified as notes receivable and $0.7\nmillion was recorded within equity method investments.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be\ncash equivalents. The Company also considers certificate of deposit accounts with original maturity dates of 12\nmonths or less and no significant early redemption cost to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and\ncash equivalents with financial institutions in the United States. These accounts may from time to time exceed\nfederally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.\nAccounts receivable, net\nThe Company’s accounts receivable primarily relate to the operations of its asset liquidation business. They\ngenerally consist of three major categories: (1) fees, commissions and retainers relating to appraisals and auctions,\n(2) receivables from asset sales, and (3) receivables from Joint Venture partners. The initial value of an account\nreceivable corresponds to the fair value of the underlying goods or services. To date, a majority of the receivables\nhave been classified as current and, due to their short-term nature, any decline in fair value would be due to issues\ninvolving collectability. At each financial statement date the collectability of each outstanding account receivable is\nevaluated, and an allowance is recorded if the book value exceeds the amount that is deemed collectable.\nThe Company accrues interest income in Accounts Receivable for the current month’s remittance process\nrelated to its notes receivable. The Company does not apply a credit loss rate against its Accounts Receivable\nbalance for accrued interest income due to the timing of collections shortly after period end and prior to the financial\nstatement filing date. Accrued interest on loans totaled $0.2 million and $0.1 million at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\nSee Note 10 for more detail regarding the Company’s accounts receivable.\nNotes receivable, net\nThe Company’s notes receivable balance consists of loans to buyers of charged-off and nonperforming\nreceivable portfolios, which is considered the only loan category or segment to be reported under the applicable\naccounting guidance. These loans are measured at historical costs and reported at their outstanding principal\nbalances net of any unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans. Loan origination fees and certain direct\norigination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans.\nF-9\nAllowance for credit losses\nIn 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“ASU 2016-13”), which\napplies a current expected credit loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than\nincurred losses. The expected credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, will be recorded through an\nallowance account that is deducted from, or added to, the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net\ncarrying value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount expected to be\ncollected. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the current accounting model for loans and debt securities acquired with\ndeteriorated credit quality under ASC Topic 310-30, Receivables – Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with\nDeteriorated Credit Quality, which provides authoritative guidance for the accounting of the Company’s notes\nreceivable. With respect to smaller reporting companies, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-\n13 resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings on January 1, 2023 of $0.3 million, and established an expected\ncredit loss reserve against our receivables related to loans outstanding, including those held within equity method\ninvestments. The increase is a result of changing from an “incurred loss” model, which encompasses allowances for\ncurrent known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an “expected loss” model, which encompasses allowances\nfor losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio.\nAccounts receivable\nThe Company carries accounts receivable at the face amounts less an allowance for estimated credit losses. As\nof December 31, 2022, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $0.1 million had been recorded. The Company\nestimates its reserve for credit losses using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating\nto past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nThe Company only extends credit to entities and institutions of significance, such as well-known academic\nand financial institutions and U.S. government agencies. Consequently, historical accounts receivable credit losses\nare nearly zero, which provides the starting point for management’s assessment of the reserve for credit losses for its\naccounts receivable. The Company elected to base its estimation of expected credit losses for accounts receivable on\nhistorical credit loss experience. However, in assessing relevant information including its assessment of current\nconditions, management determined that a credit loss allowance slightly higher than its historical data would\nindicate is appropriate for certain of its revenue generating activities.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and under previously applicable GAAP, the Company recorded a $0.1 million\nallowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable. Using a revised basis for estimation under ASU 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC\n326”), the Company increased the reserve for credit losses against its accounts receivable balances by approximately\n$10,000. Consequently, to reflect the cumulative effects of the adoption of ASC 326, which requires the application\nof a credit loss model based prospectively on current expected credit losses (CECL), the Company recorded an\nadditional reserve for credit losses and an increase to accumulated deficit of approximately $10,000 on the January\n1, 2023 condensed consolidated balance sheets, and the balance of the reserve for credit losses was therefore $0.1\nmillion as of January 1, 2023. As of December 31, 2023 the reserve for credit losses related to accounts receivable\nwas approximately $0.1 million.\nNotes receivable\nUnder ASC 326, the Company elected to evaluate notes receivable as a single pool, for individual notes\nreceivable and borrowers with similar risk characteristics. Notes receivable and borrowers that do not share risk\ncharacteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Management estimates the reserve balance using relevant\navailable information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable\nand supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience typically provides the basis for an estimation of expected\ncredit losses; however, the Company lacks sufficient data upon which to base a historical estimation. Additionally,\nsince the Company began recording notes receivable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets, the Company\nhas recorded no actual credit losses to notes receivable.\nF-10\nLacking historical internal data upon which to base a reserve for credit losses to notes receivable, the\nCompany, under ASC 326, elected to base its reserve on external credit loss experience data. Management observes\nthat the Company's notes receivable are similar in character to transactions undertaken by smaller banking\ninstitutions. The Company elected to base its estimation of expected credit losses on the Scaled Current Expected\nCredit Loss (CECL) Allowance Loss Estimator (\"SCALE rate\") available from the Federal Reserve, which was\n1.3231% as of January 1, 2023. The SCALE rate methodology is endorsed by the FASB and the Conference of State\nBank Supervisors. Management determined under ASC 326 that the SCALE rate, a generally applicable rate, may\nbe appropriately adjusted by its assessment of observable facts and relevant circumstances indicating that the factors\nanalyzed in the determination of the SCALE rate may not conform to the Company's operations and borrower\nassessments. However, in conducting its assessment of these factors, management concluded that no adjustment to\nthe SCALE rate is warranted as of January 1, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and under previously acceptable GAAP, the Company recorded no reserve for\ncredit losses to notes receivable. Using a revised basis for estimation under ASC 326, management determined the\ncumulative reserve for credit losses of $0.2 million was appropriate for notes receivable recorded on the\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. Consequently, to reflect the cumulative effects of the adoption\nof ASC 326, the Company recorded the reserve for credit losses and an increase to accumulated deficit of $0.2\nmillion on the January 1, 2023 consolidated balance sheet, and balance of the reserve for credit losses was therefore\n$0.2 million as of January 1, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the SCALE rate increased to 1.4183% and the Company's credit loss rate specific\nto notes receivable was 3.6%. The increase over the SCALE rate was due to both the above mentioned risks\npresented by a concentrated balance with a single borrower and declining collections industry-wide. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 the Company has recorded an allowance for credit losses related to notes receivable outstanding\nof $0.7 million. In order to evaluate the need for an adjustment to the receivable balance related to credit losses, or\nimpairment, the Company performs a review of all outstanding loan receivables on a quarterly basis to determine if\nany indicators exist that suggest the loan will not be fully recoverable and assess the credit quality of the loan\nreceivables. This review includes monthly and cumulative key performance indicators for each loan and borrower,\nas well as evaluation of borrower's financial condition.\nThe Company has one class of financing receivables with similar credit risk. The only specific breakout to the\ncredit risk policy is if a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. As described above, the Company notes that\none of its borrowers was experiencing financial difficulty. All of the loans comprising this borrower’s $23.8 million\nloan balance outstanding at December 31, 2023 were originated or restructured during 2023. Of the loan balance\noutstanding at December 31, 2023, originations on loans to the Company's other borrowers were $13.6 million and\n$1.0 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEquity method investments\nUpon adoption of ASC 326 on January 1, 2023, the Company evaluated the receivable balances held by its\naffiliated joint ventures and recorded an adjustment to reduce earnings from equity method investments by the\nCompany's share of the allowance for credit losses recorded on the joint ventures’ books of $0.2 million. Similar to\nnotes receivable, the loans held by the joint ventures are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if an adjustment\nto the allowance for credit losses is needed. As of December 31, 2023, the SCALE rate increased to 1.4183% and\nthe credit loss rate specific to equity method investments was 4.3%. The increase over the SCALE rate was due to\nboth the above mentioned risks presented by a concentrated balance with a single borrower and declining collections\nindustry-wide. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded an allowance for credit losses related to its\nequity method investments of $0.9 million.\nInventory - equipment\nThe Company’s inventory consists of assets acquired for resale, which are normally expected to be sold within\na one-year operating cycle. All inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value.\nF-11\nEmployee retention credit\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into\nlaw providing numerous tax provisions and other stimulus measures, including the Employee Retention Credit\n(\"ERC\"), which is a refundable tax credit against certain employment taxes. The Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster\nTax Relief Act of 2020 and the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 extended and expanded the availability of the\nERC.\nAs an employer that carried on a trade or business during calendar year 2020 and whose gross receipts were\nless than 80% in relation to comparable periods in 2019, the Company is eligible for the refundable ERC under the\nCares Act for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021.\nAs the Company has incurred certain employment taxes during 2021 and have yet to receive the refundable\nERC, the Company has accounted for the credit as a loss recovery under ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and\nEnvironmental Obligations (by analogy), which indicates that a claim for recovery should be recognized only when\nthe claim is probable as it is defined in ASC Topic 450, Contingencies. The Company has determined that the claim\nis in alignment with applicable regulatory criteria, the amounts are known and realizable, and refundable ERC is\nprobable. As of December 31, 2023, we have received $0.7 million related to the employee retention credit. $0.6\nmillion was recorded as a receivable as of December 31, 2022, and $0.1 million was offset against selling, general\nand administrative costs on the statement of income in 2023.\nEquity method investments\nAs noted above, the Company conducts a portion of its business through Joint Ventures. Transactions in\nwhich the ownership share meets the criteria for the equity method investments under ASC 323 are accounted for\nusing the equity method of accounting whereby the Company's proportionate share of the Joint Venture’s net\nincome (loss) is reported in the consolidated income statement as earnings of equity method investments. At the\nbalance sheet date, the Company's investments in these Joint Ventures are reported in the consolidated balance sheet\nas equity method investments. The Company monitors the value of each Joint Ventures’ underlying assets and\nliabilities, and records a write down of the investments should the Company conclude that there has been a decline\nin the value of the net assets. These investments have historically been classified as non-current in the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements due to the uncertainties relating to the timing of resale of the underlying assets as a\nresult of the Joint Venture relationship. See Note 5 for further detail.\nFair value of financial instruments\nThe fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current\ntransaction between willing parties, other than in a forced sale or liquidation. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the\ncarrying values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other assets, and accounts payable\napproximate fair value given the short term nature of these instruments. The Company’s notes receivable and debt\nobligations approximate fair value as a result of the interest rate on the receivable or debt obligation approximating\nprevailing market rates.\nThere are three levels within the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical\nassets or liabilities; Level 2 – significant other observable inputs; and Level 3 – significant unobservable inputs. At\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no material financial instruments requiring fair value measurement\non a recurring basis.\nF-12\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value upon acquisition. Those with an estimated useful life are amortized,\nand those with an indefinite useful life are unamortized. Subsequent to acquisition, the Company monitors events\nand changes in circumstances that require an assessment of intangible asset recoverability. Indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are assessed at least annually to determine both if they remain indefinite-lived and if they are\nimpaired. The Company assesses whether or not there have been any events or changes in circumstances that\nsuggest the value of the asset may not be recoverable. Amortized intangible assets are not tested annually, but are\nassessed when events and changes in circumstances suggest the assets may be impaired. If an assessment determines\nthat the carrying amount of any intangible asset is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized in the income\nstatement, determined by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value. All of the Company’s\nidentifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 have been acquired as part of the acquisitions of HGP\nin 2012, NLEX in 2014 and ALT in 2021, and are discussed in more detail in Note 10. No impairment charges were\nnecessary during 2023 and 2022.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill, which results from the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net identifiable\ntangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination, is not amortized but, in accordance with GAAP, is\ntested at least annually for impairment. The Company performs its annual impairment test as of October 1. In\ntesting goodwill, the Company initially uses a qualitative approach and analyzes relevant factors to determine if\nevents and circumstances have affected the value of the goodwill. If the result of this qualitative analysis indicates it\nis more likely than not that the value has been impaired, the Company then applies a quantitative approach to\ncalculate the difference between the goodwill’s recorded value and its fair value. An impairment loss is recognized\nto the extent that the recorded value exceeds its fair value. Goodwill, in addition to being tested for impairment\nannually, is tested for impairment at interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more\nlikely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired.\nAll of the Company’s goodwill relates to its acquisitions of HGP in 2012, NLEX in 2014 and ALT in 2021,\nand is discussed in more detail in Note 9.\nDeferred income taxes\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of\nassets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements, based upon the enacted\ntax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company establishes a valuation\nallowance when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In 2014, as a result of\nincurring losses in previous years, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against all of its net deferred tax\nassets. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a reduction to the valuation allowance resulting in a net\ndeferred tax asset balance of approximately $9.4 million as it was more likely than not that a significant portion our\nnet operating loss carryforwards will be utilized. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company further reduced the\nvaluation allowance by $2.2 million, resulting in a net deferred tax asset balance of approximately $9.1 million, to\nalign with the Company's updated forecasts. For further discussion of our income taxes, see Note 13.\nLiabilities and contingencies\nThe Company is involved from time to time in various legal matters arising out of its operations in the normal\ncourse of business. On a case by case basis, the Company evaluates the likelihood of possible outcomes for this\nlitigation. Based on this evaluation, the Company determines whether a loss accrual is appropriate. If the likelihood\nof a negative outcome is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated, the Company accounts for the\nestimated loss in the current period. See Note 12 for further discussion.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers (“ASC 606”) and ASC Topic 310, Receivables (“ASC 310”).\nF-13\nServices revenue generally consists of commissions and fees from providing auction services, appraisals,\nbrokering of sales transactions, and secured lending. Asset sales revenue generally consists of proceeds obtained\nthrough sales of purchased assets. With the exception of revenue generated within our Specialty Lending segment,\nrevenue is recognized for both services revenue and asset sales revenue based on the ASC 606 standard recognition\nmodel, which consists of the following: (1) an agreement exists between two or more parties that creates enforceable\nrights and obligations, (2) the performance obligations are clearly identified, (3) the transaction price has been\ndetermined, (4) the transaction price has been properly allocated to each performance obligation, and (5) the entity\nsatisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer for each of the entities.\nAll services and asset sales revenue from contracts with customers consists of three reportable segments:\nAuction and Liquidation, Refurbishment & Resale, and Brokerage. Generally, revenue is recognized at the point in\ntime in which the performance obligation has been satisfied and full consideration is received. The exception to\nrecognition at a point in time occurs when certain contracts provide for advance payments recognized over a period\nof time. Services revenue recognized over a period of time is not material in comparison to total revenues (less than\n1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023), and therefore not reported on a disaggregated basis.\nFurther, as certain contracts stipulate that the customer make advance payments, amounts not recognized within the\nreporting period are considered deferred revenue and the Company’s “contract liability”. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe deferred revenue balance was approximately $0.5 million and is recorded within accounts payable and accrued\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The deferred revenue balance is primarily related to customer deposits\non asset sales within the Refurbishment & Resale segment. The Company records receivables in certain situations\nbased on timing of payments for Auction and Liquidation transactions held at the end of the reporting period;\nhowever, revenue is generally recognized in the period that the Company satisfies the performance obligation and\ncash is collected. The Company does not record a “contract asset” for partially satisfied performance obligations.\nFor auction services and brokerage sale transactions, funds are typically collected from buyers and are held by\nthe Company on the seller's behalf. The funds are included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance\nsheets. The Company releases the funds to the seller, less the Company's commission and other fees due, after the\nbuyer has accepted the goods. The amount of cash held on behalf of the sellers is recorded as payables to sellers in\nthe accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company evaluates revenue from Auction and Liquidation and Brokerage segment transactions in\naccordance with the accounting guidance to determine whether to report such revenue on a gross or net basis. The\nCompany has determined that it acts as an agent for its fee based transactions and therefore reports the revenue from\ntransactions in which the Company acts as an agent on a net basis.\nThe Company also earns income through transactions that involve the Company acting jointly with one or\nmore additional purchasers or lenders, pursuant to a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company (“LLC”)\nagreement. For these transactions, in which the Company’s ownership share meets the criteria for the equity method\ninvestments under ASC Topic 323, the Company does not record revenue or expense. Instead, the Company’s\nproportionate share of the net income (loss) is reported as earnings of equity method investments. In general, the\nJoint Ventures apply the same revenue recognition and other accounting policies as the Company.\nThrough our Specialty Lending segment, the Company provides specialty financing solutions to investors in\ncharged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios. The Company recognizes revenue generated by lending activity in\naccordance with ASC 310. Fees collected in relation to the issuance of loans includes loan origination fees, interest\nincome, portfolio monitoring fees, and a backend profit share percentage related to the underlying asset portfolio.\nThe loan origination fees are offset with any direct origination costs and are deferred upon issuance of the loan\nand amortized over the lives of the related loans, as an adjustment to interest income. The interest method is used to\narrive at a periodic interest cost (including amortization) that will represent a level effective rate on the sum of the\nface amount of the debt and (plus or minus) the unamortized premium or discount and expense at the beginning of\neach period.\nThe monitoring fees and the backend profit share are considered a separate earnings process as compared to\nthe origination fees and interest income. Monitoring fees are recorded at the agreed upon rate, and at the moment in\nwhich payments are made by the borrower. The backend profit share is recognized in accordance with the agreed\nupon rate at the time in which the amount is realizable and earned. The recognition policy was established due to the\nuncertainty of timing of the amount of backend profit share which will be realized.\nF-14\nCost of services revenue and asset sales\nCost of services revenue generally includes the direct costs associated with generating commissions and fees\nfrom the Company’s auction and appraisal services, merger and acquisition advisory services, and brokering of\ncharged-off receivable portfolios. The Company recognizes these expenses in the period in which the revenue they\nrelate to is recorded. Cost of asset sales generally includes the cost of purchased inventory and the related direct\ncosts of selling inventory. The Company recognizes these expenses in the period in which title to the inventory\npasses to the buyer, and the buyer assumes the risk and reward of the inventory.\nStock-based compensation\nThe Company’s stock-based compensation is primarily in the form of options to purchase common shares and\nissuances of restricted stock. The grant date fair value of stock options is calculated using the Black-Scholes option\npricing model. The determination of the fair value of the Company’s stock options is based on a variety of factors\nincluding, but not limited to, the price of the Company’s common stock, the expected volatility of the stock price\nover the expected life of the award, and expected exercise behavior. The grant date fair value of the awards is\nsubsequently expensed over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures. The provisions of the Company’s stock-\nbased compensation plans do not require the Company to settle any options by transferring cash or other assets, and\ntherefore the Company classifies the option awards as equity. See Note 16 for further discussion of the Company’s\nstock-based compensation.\nAdvertising\nThe Company expenses advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising and promotion\nexpense included in selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nwas $0.6 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nFuture accounting pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-07, \"Segment\nReporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-07\"), which, among other\nupdates, requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating\ndecision maker, as well as the aggregate amount of other segment items included in the reported measure of segment\nprofit or loss. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective adoption. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and the\nrelated disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income\nTax Disclosures\" (\"ASU 2023-09\"), which requires enhanced annual disclosures with respect to the rate\nreconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, and may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial statements and the related\ndisclosures.\nNote 3 – Notes Receivable, net\nThe Company’s notes receivable balance consists of loans to buyers of charged-off and nonperforming\nreceivable portfolios, which resulted in a total balance of approximately $17.5 million, net of unamortized deferred\nfees and costs on originated loans and the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023. The activity during\n2023 includes the additional investment in notes receivable net of transfers to partners of approximately $21.0\nmillion, principal payments made by borrowers of approximately $11.9 million, adjustments to the deferred fees and\ncosts balance of approximately $0.1 million, and the allowance for credit losses totaling approximately $0.7 million.\nF-15\nThe table below shows the Company’s lending activity:\n2023 2022\nNotes receivable, beginning of year $ 9,161 $ 4,172\nInvestment in notes receivable 29,826 8,435\nTransfer of notes (8,851) —\nPrincipal repayments (11,876) (3,446)\nNotes receivable, end of year 18,260 9,161\nDeferred financing fees and costs, net (139) (411)\nAllowance for credit loss (650) —\nNotes receivable, net, end of year $ 17,471 $ 8,750\nIn accordance with ASC 326, the Company performs a review of notes receivable on a quarterly basis. During\n2023, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses in selling, general and administrative expense on the\nconsolidated statement of income of approximately $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit\nlosses was approximately $0.7 million. An allowance for credit losses was not recorded as of December 31, 2022.\nThe allowance for credit losses in 2023 was primarily driven by weakening economic conditions for the underlying\ncharged-off and nonperforming portfolio collections and increases in loan balances. The Company's credit loss\nreserve rate specific to its notes receivable balance as of December 31, 2023 was 3.6%. As of December 31, 2023,\nthe Company has recorded no actual credit losses on notes receivable.\nNote 4 – Lessor Arrangement\nIn June 2019, the Company, with certain partners, entered into agreements to lease, with a purchase option, a\nfully functional manufacturing building, including all machinery and equipment held within. The assets under lease\nrelate to the Company’s purchase, with certain partners, of a pharmaceutical campus in Huntsville, Alabama, which\nwas finalized in the fourth quarter of 2018. The lessee is obligated to make monthly lease payments over a ten year\nperiod, totaling approximately $13.2 million for the real estate portion, and monthly lease payments over a six year\nperiod totaling approximately $9.7 million for the machinery and equipment. The lessor arrangement is classified as\na sales-type lease, and, therefore, the present value of future lease payments has been recognized as revenue and a\nlease receivable as of the effective date.\nThe real estate portion of the arrangement is held by CPFH LLC, the joint venture, and is accounted for under\nthe equity method where the Company’s share in earnings from equity method investments is shown in one line item\non the income statement. Refer to Note 5 for further information.\nThe machinery and equipment portion of the arrangement is jointly owned by all the partners of CPFH LLC,\napart from the joint venture entity. Therefore, the Company has derecognized the leased asset of approximately $0.9\nmillion and recognized as revenue approximately $1.2 million, which represents the present value of future lease\npayments and a lease receivable included in the accounts receivable line item on the balance sheet, consistent and\nreflective of its business model for asset sales.\nThe purchase option for both the real estate and machinery and equipment could be exercised at any time on\nor after December 1, 2019, and before May 31, 2021, for a total purchase price of $20.0 million, of which\n$12.0 million and $8.0 million are allocated to the real estate and machinery and equipment, respectively. On May\n31, 2021, the lessee delivered written notice to exercise the purchase option. The lessee confirmed that its intention\nwas to exercise the option, however, was unable to complete the transaction before the purchase option’s original\nexpiration date of November 30, 2021. CPFH LLC and lessee negotiated an amendment to the purchase option in\nMarch of 2022, increasing the purchase price for the real estate to $15.0 million. On June 30, 2022, the lessee\nexercised its purchase option by completing the real estate transaction and terminating the lease.\nF-16\nNote 5 – Equity Method Investments\nIn November 2018, CPFH LLC, of which the Company holds a 25% share, was formed to purchase certain\nreal estate assets among partners in a joint venture. In March 2020, HGC Origination I LLC and HGC Funding I\nLLC were formed as joint ventures with a partner for purposes of conducting business relating to the sourcing,\norigination and funding of loans to debt purchasing clients. In April 2022, KNFH LLC, of which the Company holds\na 25% share, was formed to purchase certain real estate assets and machinery and equipment among partners in a\njoint venture. In December 2022, DHC8 LLC, of which the Company holds a 13.33% share was formed to provide\nfunding and receive principal and interest payments as a result of the initial investment. In May 2023, HGC MPG\nFunding LLC, of which the Company holds a 25% share, was formed as a joint venture with a partner for purposes\nof conducting business relating to the sourcing, origination and funding of loans to debt purchasing clients. In\nDecember 2023, KNFH II LLC, of which the Company holds a 25% share, was formed to purchase certain real\nestate assets and machinery and equipment among partners in a joint venture. CPFH LLC, KNFH LLC, DHC8 LLC\nand KNFH II LLC are joint ventures formed in connection with the Company’s Industrial Assets division, whereas\nHGC Origination I LLC, HGC Funding I LLC, and HGC MPG Funding LLC were formed in connection with the\nFinancial Assets division. The Company has significant influence over the operations and financial policies of each\nof its equity method investments.\nIn accordance with ASC 326, the Company performs a review of notes receivable on a quarterly basis for each\nof its specialty lending investments. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s share of the joint\nventure’s provision for credit losses was approximately $0.7 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's\nshare of the allowance for credit losses was approximately $0.9 million, representing a credit loss rate of 4.3%\nspecific to its equity method investments, which was primarily related to HGC Origination I LLC and HGC MPG\nFunding LLC. The provision for credit losses was primarily driven by weakening economic conditions for the\nunderlying charged-off and nonperforming portfolio collections and increases in loan balances. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company has recorded no actual credit losses through its equity method investments.\nBased on the nature of our equity method investments, the joint venture entities' revenues and gross profit are\nnot materially different and furthermore, operating income and net income have no material differences. The table\nbelow details the Company’s joint venture revenues and earnings (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenues and gross profit:\nCPFH LLC $ — $ 31,072\nKNFH LLC 303 22,183\nDHC8 LLC 1,533 —\nKNFH II LLC — —\nHGC Funding I LLC and Origination I LLC 4,942 2,665\nHGC MPG Funding LLC 1,400 —\nTotal revenues and gross profit $ 8,178 $ 55,920\nOperating income (loss) and net income (loss):\nCPFH LLC $ — $ 15,357\nKNFH LLC (146) 9,930\nDHC8 LLC 1,305 —\nKNFH II LLC — —\nHGC Funding I LLC and Origination I LLC 4,378 2,645\nHGC MPG Funding LLC 1,395 —\nTotal operating income (loss) and net income (loss) $ 6,932 $ 27,932\nThe table below details the summarized components of assets and liabilities of the Company’s joint ventures\n(in thousands):\nF-17\nDecember 31,December 31,\n2023 2022\nAssets:\nCPFH LLC — —\nKNFH LLC 292 —\nDHC8 LLC 7,061 8,561\nKNFH II LLC 8,150 —\nHGC Funding I LLC and Origination I LLC 28,389 53,385\nHGC MPG Funding LLC 38,081 —\nTotal assets $ 81,973$ 61,946\nLiabilities:\nCPFH LLC — —\nKNFH LLC 289 47\nDHC8 LLC 1,102 1,028\nKNFH II LLC 4,000 —\nHGC Funding I LLC and Origination I LLC 10 1,504\nHGC MPG Funding LLC — —\nTotal liabilities $ 5,401$ 2,579\nNote 6 – Earnings per Share\nThe Company is required, in periods in which it has net income, to calculate basic earnings per share (“basic\nEPS”) using the two-class method. The two-class method is required because the Company’s shares of Series N\npreferred stock, each of which is convertible to 40 common shares, have the right to receive dividends or dividend\nequivalents should the Company declare dividends on its common stock. Under the two-class method, earnings for\nthe period are allocated on a pro-rata basis to the common and preferred stockholders. The weighted-average\nnumber of common and preferred shares outstanding during the period is then used to calculate basic EPS for each\nclass of shares. For 2023 and 2022, the earnings allocated to the preferred shares outstanding were not material.\nIn periods in which the Company has a net loss, basic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss\nattributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. The two-class method is not used in periods in which the Company has a net loss because the preferred stock\ndoes not participate in losses.\nStock options and other potential common shares are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share\n(“diluted EPS”). The Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating dilutive potential common shares. In\ncalculating diluted EPS, such shares are assumed to be exercised or converted, except when their effect would be\nanti-dilutive.\nThe table below shows the calculation of the shares used in computing diluted EPS:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nWeighted Average Shares Calculation: 2023 2022\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 36,677,098 36,016,619\nTreasury stock effect of common stock options and\nrestricted stock awards 910,210 1,080,651\nDiluted weighted average common shares\noutstanding 37,587,308 37,097,270\nFor both 2023 and 2022 there were potential common shares totaling approximately 0.8 million that were\nexcluded from the computation of diluted EPS as the inclusion of such shares would have been anti-dilutive.\nF-18\nNote 7 – Leases\nThe Company leases office and warehouse space primarily in four locations: Del Mar, CA; Hayward, CA; San\nDiego, CA and Edwardsville, IL. As each contract does not meet any of the criteria for financing lease classification,\nthe Company has determined that each lease arrangement should be classified as an operating lease.\nOn August 12, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement (the “Lease”) with Liberty Industrial Park, LLC\n(“Landlord”) pursuant to which the Company leases 6,627 square feet of industrial space in San Diego, California\nfrom Landlord. The Lease has a commencement date of September 1, 2022. The Lease provides for an initial\nmonthly base rent of $11,266, which increases on an annual basis to $13,180 per month in the final year. In addition,\nthe Company is obligated to pay its share of maintenance costs of common areas.\nOn June 1, 2023, the Company amended its Edwardsville office building lease with David Ludwig, extending\nthe term of the agreement to May 31, 2027 and setting rent amounts for the new term. It provides for an initial\nmonthly base rent of $9,412, which increases on an annual basis to $9,914 per month in the final year.\nThe right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for each location are as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, December 31,\nRight-of-use assets: 2023 2022\nDel Mar, CA $ 186 $ 336\nHayward, CA 1,525 1,800\nSan Diego, CA 477 590\nEdwardsville, IL 351 50\nTotal right-of-use assets $ 2,539 $ 2,776\nDecember 31, December 31,\nLease liabilities: 2023 2022\nDel Mar, CA $ 203 $ 360\nHayward, CA 1,594 1,852\nSan Diego, CA 498 605\nEdwardsville, IL 353 50\nTotal lease liabilities $ 2,648 $ 2,867\nThe Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, and, therefore, the Company uses its\nincremental borrowing rate as the discount rate when measuring operating lease liabilities. The incremental\nborrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur at lease commencement to\nborrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular\ncurrency environment. The Company used its incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019 for operating leases\nthat commenced prior to that date. As of January 1, 2019, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate was 5.25%.\nFor leases commencing after January 1, 2019 the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at time of\ncommencement. On September 1, 2022 and June 1, 2023, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate was 5.50%.\nand 7.25%, respectively. The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases is 4.1 years and the\nweighted average discount rate is 5.35%.\nLease expense for leases determined to be operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease\nterm. For 2023 and 2022, lease expense was approximately $0.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively. Cash paid\nfor operating leases in both 2023 and 2022 was $0.8 million. The Company had no short-term or variable leases in\n2023 or 2022.\nThe lease expense for each location are as follows (in thousands):\nF-19\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nDel Mar, CA $ 163 $ 163\nHayward, CA 361 361\nSan Diego, CA 144 48\nEdwardsville, IL 113 109\nTotal $ 781 $ 681\nAs of December 31, 2023, undiscounted future minimum lease payments related to leases that have initial or\nremaining lease terms in excess of one year are as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 789\n2025 660\n2026 649\n2027 543\n2028 299\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 2,940\nLess imputed interest (292)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 2,648\nNote 8 – Property and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is provided for in amounts sufficient to\nrelate the cost of depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives on a straight-line basis. The life of\nthe building acquired in connection of the ALT purchase transaction was determined to be 25 years. Leasehold\nimprovements are amortized over the useful life of the asset or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Estimated service\nlives are five years for furniture, fixtures and office equipment and three years for software and technology assets.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance not considered to substantially lengthen the life of the asset or increase\ncapacity or efficiency are charged to expense as incurred.\nThe following summarizes the components of the Company’s property and equipment (in thousands):\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nBuilding $ 985 $ 985\nLand 397 397\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment 286 223\nSoftware and technology assets 372 173\nVehicles 11 11\n2,051 1,789\nAccumulated depreciation (346) (218)\nProperty and equipment, net $ 1,705 $ 1,571\nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment was $0.1 million for both the years ended December\n31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-20\nNote 9 – Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nIntangible assets\nThe details of identifiable intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are shown below (in thousands\nexcept for lives):\nOriginalRemainingCarrying Value Carrying Value\nLife Life December 31, December 31,\nAmortized Intangible Assets (years) (years) 2022 Amortization 2023\nTrade Name (HGP) 14 1.0$ 257$ (129)$ 128\nTrade Name (ALT) 20 17.7 607 (32) 575\nVendor Relationship (ALT) 5 2.7 843 (230) 613\nTotal 1,707 (391) 1,316\nUnamortized Intangible Assets\nTrade Name (NLEX) N/A N/A 2,437 — 2,437\nTotal $ 4,144$ (391)$ 3,753\nOriginalRemainingCarrying Value Carrying Value\nLife Life December 31, December 31,\nAmortized Intangible Assets (years) (years) 2021 Amortization 2022\nCustomer Relationships (HGP) 12 —$ 30$ (30)$ —\nTrade Name (HGP) 14 2.0 386 (129) 257\nTrade Name (ALT) 20 18.7 639 (32) 607\nVendor Relationship (ALT) 5 3.7 1,073 (230) 843\nTotal 2,128 (421) 1,707\nUnamortized Intangible Assets\nTrade Name (NLEX) N/A N/A 2,437 — 2,437\nTotal $ 4,565$ (421)$ 4,144\nAmortization expense during each of 2023 and 2022 was $0.4 million.

The Company, therefore, is not exposed to significant\ncollectability risk relating to these receivables. Given this experience, together with the ongoing business relationships\nbetween the Company and its joint venture partners, the Company has not historically required a formal credit quality\nassessment in connection with these activities. The Company has not experienced any significant collectability issues\nwith its accounts receivable. As the Company’s business expands, more comprehensive credit assessments may be\nrequired.\nThe Company's allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2022.\nIn accordance with ASC 326, the Company performs a review of accounts receivables on a quarterly basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded no material adjustments for credit losses in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expense on the condensed consolidated statement of income related to accounts receivable.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses was approximately $0.1 million.\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted of the following, (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nRemuneration and benefits 4,423 4,660\nAccrued auction and liquidation expenses 705 2,573\nDue to Joint Venture partners 638 793\nDeferred revenue 497 279\nSales and other taxes 626 220\nAccounting, auditing and tax consulting 189 204\nOther 159 195\nTotal accounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 7,237 $ 8,924\nNote 11 – Debt\nOutstanding debt is summarized as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nALT note $ 511 $ 531\n2021 credit facility - 2,880\n2023 credit facility 1,222 -\nTotal third party debt, current 1,733 3,411\nNon-current:\nALT note 395 871\n2023 credit facility 5,100 -\nTotal third party debt, non-current 5,495 871\nTotal third party debt $ 7,228 $ 4,282\n2021 Credit Facility\nF-22\nOn May 5, 2021, the Company entered into a promissory note, business loan agreement, commercial security\nagreement and pledge agreement (the “2021 Credit Facility”) with C3bank, National Association (\"Lender\") for a\n$10.0 million revolving line of credit. The Company is permitted to use the proceeds of the loan solely for its\nbusiness operations. The Company is the borrower under the 2021 Credit Facility. The 2021 Credit Facility is\nsecured by a security interest in certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ current and future tangible and intangible\nassets, inventory, chattel paper, accounts, equipment and general intangibles, and a pledge of the equity of the direct\nand indirect subsidiaries of the Company.\nOn August 23, 2022, the Company entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Reaffirmation of Loan\n(the “2022 Modification Agreement”), effective as of April 1, 2022, by and between the Company and Lender. The\n2022 Modification Agreement modified and reaffirmed the 2021 Credit Facility to provide for, among other things,\nthe arrangement of financial covenants, which remained unchanged, into two categories: (i) financial covenants used\nto resize the maximum principal amount available to the Company as of the date of determination (as determined by\nLender in its sole discretion), and (ii) financial covenants to be maintained by the Company.\nOn May 26, 2023, the Company entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Reaffirmation of Loan (the\n“Modification Agreement”), effective as of May 26, 2023, by and between the Company and Lender. The\nModification Agreement modifies and reaffirms the 2021 Credit Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity\ndate, modify the applicable interest rate, and further modify the loan covenants. The maturity date was modified to\nOctober 27, 2024. The applicable interest rate spread and floor was modified to be the Wall Street Journal Prime rate\nplus 1.00% (such rate not to be less than 6.75% per annum). Additionally, the Modification Agreement modifies the\nloan covenants to provide that the Company shall pay the Lender an annual unused line fee, payable on the earlier of\n(a) bi-annually every six (6) months in arrears, within ten (10) days thereof, commencing on October 27, 2023, or\n(b) the payment in full of the 2021 Credit Facility, but only if the average balance of the 2021 Credit Facility for the\nrespective nine months is below $5.0 million. The availability of additional draws under the 2021 Credit Facility is\nconditioned, among other things, on the compliance with certain customary representations and warranties,\nincluding default, insolvency or bankruptcy, material adverse change in financial condition and any guarantor’s\nattempt to revise its guarantee. The agreement governing the 2021 Credit Facility also contains customary\naffirmative covenants regarding, among other things, the maintenance of records, maintenance of certain insurance\ncoverage, compliance with governmental requirements and maintenance of several financial covenants. The 2021\nCredit Facility contains certain customary financial covenants and negative covenants that, among other things,\ninclude restrictions on the Company’s ability to create, incur or assume indebtedness for borrowed money, including\ncapital leases or to sell, transfer, mortgage, assign, pledge, lease, grant a security interest in, or encumber any of the\nCompany’s assets. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial and negative\ncovenants. As of December 31, 2023, there was no outstanding balance on the 2021 Credit Facility.\nThe Company's weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 was 9.51% and 5.15%, respectively.\nALT Note\nOn August 23, 2021, the Company entered into a $2.0 million subordinated promissory note with an interest\nrate of 3% per annum and a maturity date of August 23, 2025 (the “ALT Note”) as part of the aggregate purchase\nprice paid to acquire certain assets and liabilities of American Laboratory Trading. The ALT Note requires 48 equal\ninstallments of approximately $44,000 on the first day of each month beginning September 23, 2021 with the final\npayment due on August 23, 2025. The outstanding balance of the ALT Note as of December 31, 2023 was $0.9\nmillion of which $0.5 million was classified as \"current\" and $0.4 million was classified as \"non-current.\"\n2023 Credit Facility\nF-23\nOn May 26, 2023, the Company entered into a promissory note, a business loan agreement and commercial\nsecurity agreement (collectively, the “2023 Credit Facility”) with C3 Bank. The 2023 Credit Facility provides for a\nnew $7.0 million term loan (the \"Term Loan\") which is repayable in monthly installments of principal and interest\nuntil the maturity date of April 27, 2028. The company determines the current portion of the Term Loan to be the\namount of principal owed in the next 12 months. The Term Loan sets the interest rate spread and interest rate floor\nto accrue at a variable interest rate, which is based on the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as\nthe “prime rate,” plus a margin of 0.250%. Additionally, the Term Loan provides that in the event of prepayment the\nCompany shall pay the Lender a prepayment fee during the first year equal to twelve months of interest (less interest\nactually paid). The Company is the borrower under the Term Loan and is permitted to use the proceeds of the Term\nLoan solely for its business operations. The Term Loan is secured by a security interest in certain of the Company’s\nand its certain subsidiaries’ current and future tangible and intangible assets, inventory, chattel paper, accounts,\nequipment and general intangibles and a pledge of the equity of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Company.\nSpecifically, the Term Loan is secured by the building currently used by ALT in East Lyme, CT. As of December\n31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all financial and negative covenants. As of December 31, 2023, the\noutstanding balance on the Term Loan was $6.3 million, of which $1.2 million was classified as \"current\" and $5.1\nmillion was classified as \"non-current.\"\nAs of December 31, 2023, undiscounted future principal debt payments are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Amount\n2024 $ 1,733\n2025 1,732\n2026 1,460\n2027 1,595\n2028 708\nTotal $ 7,228\nNote 12 – Commitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2023 the Company does not expect any potential contingent liabilities, individually or in the\naggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its assets or results of operations.\nNote 13 – Income Taxes\nIn 2014 the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, reducing the carrying\nvalue of those assets to zero as a result of historical losses. The following table summarizes the change in the\nvaluation allowance during 2022 and 2023, (in thousands):\nBalance as of December 31, 2021 $ 12,242\nChange during 2022 (7,813)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022 4,429\nChange during 2023 (2,205)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 2,224\nAs of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect\nits view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2022, and due primarily to the performance\nof the Company, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that is it more likely\nthan not that additional deferred tax assets of $7.1 million are realizable. The Company therefore reduced the\nvaluation allowance accordingly. At December 31, 2023, management reevaluated the Company's performance and\nforecast for the next five years and concluded that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that is it more\nlikely than not that additional deferred tax assets of $2.2 million are realizable.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company has aggregate federal net operating loss carry forwards of $50.0 million.\nThese net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2024.\nThe Company’s utilization of restricted net operating tax loss carry forwards against future income for tax\npurposes is restricted pursuant to the “change in ownership” rules in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nF-24\nThese rules, in general, provide that an ownership change occurs when the percentage shareholdings of 5% direct or\nindirect stockholders of a loss corporation have, in aggregate, increased by more than 50 percentage points during\nthe immediately preceding three years.\nRestrictions in net operating loss carry forwards occurred in 2001 as a result of the acquisition of the\nCompany by Street Capital. Pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the annual usage of the\nCompany’s net operating loss carry forwards was limited to approximately $2.5 million per annum until 2008 and\n$1.7 million per annum through December 31, 2023. There is no certainty that the application of these “change in\nownership” rules may not recur, resulting in further restrictions on the Company’s income tax loss carry forwards\nexisting at a particular time. In addition, further restrictions, reductions in, or expiration of net operating loss and net\ncapital loss carry forwards may occur through future merger, acquisition and/or disposition transactions or failure to\ncontinue a significant level of business activities. Any such additional limitations could require the Company to pay\nincome taxes on its future earnings and record an income tax expense to the extent of such liability, despite the\nexistence of such tax loss carry forwards. The Company has not identified any change in ownership in prior years\nthat would render current non-limited net operating loss carryforwards to be limited under Section 382.\nAll loss taxation years remain open for audit pending the application of the respective tax losses against\nincome in a subsequent taxation year. In general, the statute of limitations expires three years from the date that a\ncompany files a tax return applying prior year tax loss carry forwards against income for tax purposes in the later\nyear. The 2020 through 2022 taxation years remain open for audit.\nThe Company is subject to state income tax in multiple jurisdictions. In most states, the Company does not\nhave tax loss carry forwards available to shield income attributable to a particular state from being subject to tax in\nthat particular state.\nThe reported tax expense varies from the amount that would be provided by applying the statutory U.S.\nFederal income tax rate to the income before income tax expense for the following reasons in each of the years\nended December 31, (in thousands):\n2023 2022\nExpected federal statutory tax expense $ 2,939 $ 2,311\nIncrease (reduction) in taxes resulting from:\nState income taxes 996 470\nNon-deductible expenses (permanent differences) (196) (179)\nChange in valuation allowance (2,205) (7,813)\nOther (14) 725\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 1,520 $ (4,486)\nIncome tax expense/(benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was comprised of the\nfollowing (amounts in thousands):\n2023 2022\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ -\nState 1,188 475\nTotal current provision for (benefit from)\nincome taxes 1,188 475\nDeferred:\nFederal 465 (4,812)\nState (133) (149)\nTotal deferred provision for (benefit from)\nincome taxes 332 (4,961)\nTotal provision for (benefit from) income taxes $ 1,520 $ (4,486)\nThe components of the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are as follows in\n(thousands):\nF-25\n2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carry forwards $ 11,012 $ 14,097\nStock based compensation 348 317\nIntangibles 224 0\nOperating lease liabilities 628 742\nEquity method investments 239 —\nAllowance for credit loss 176 —\nAccruals 131 —\nOther 137 280\nTotal gross deferred tax assets 12,895 15,436\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nTrade names (708) (686)\nCustomer relationships (48) (27)\nEquity method investments (28) —\nOperating lease right-of-use assets (599) (718)\nOther (173) (127)\nTotal gross deferred tax liabilities (1,556) (1,558)\nTotal deferred tax assets 11,339 13,878\nLess: valuation allowance (2,224) (4,429)\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 9,115 $ 9,449\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The IRA has not had a material impact\nto the Company’s financial statements for the tax years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022 and management does not\nbelieve it will have a material impact on the Company's financial statements in future tax years.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial\nstatement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Upon adoption\nof this principle in 2007, the Company derecognized certain tax positions that, upon examination, more likely than\nnot would not have been sustained as a recognized tax benefit. As a result of derecognizing uncertain tax positions,\nthe Company has recorded a cumulative reduction in its deferred tax assets of approximately $4.4 million associated\nwith prior years’ tax benefits, which are not expected to be available primarily due to change of control usage\nrestrictions, and a reduction in the rate of the tax benefit associated with all of its tax attributes.\nDue to the Company’s historic policy of applying a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets, the\neffect of the above was an offsetting reduction in the Company’s valuation allowance. Accordingly, the above\nreduction had no net impact on the Company’s financial position, operations or cash flow. As of December 31,\n2023, the total unrecognized tax benefit has been determined to be $4.4 million.\nIn the unlikely event that these tax benefits are recognized in the future, the amount recognized at that time\nshould result in a reduction in the Company’s effective tax rate.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in\nincome tax expense. Because the Company has tax loss carry forwards in excess of the unrecognized tax benefits,\nthe Company did not accrue for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits either upon the initial\nderecognition of uncertain tax positions or in the current period.\nIt is possible that the total amount of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or\ndecrease within the next 12 months. These changes may be the result of future audits, the application of “change in\nownership” rules leading to further restrictions in tax losses arising from changes in the capital structure of the\nCompany, reductions in available tax loss carry forwards through future merger, acquisition and/or disposition\nF-26\ntransactions, failure to continue a significant level of business activities, or other circumstances not known to\nmanagement at this time. At this time, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\nNote 14 – Related Party Transactions\nAs part of the operations of NLEX, the Company leases office space in Edwardsville, IL that is owned by the\nPresident of the Financial Assets Division, David Ludwig. The total amount paid to the related party was\napproximately $0.1 million for both years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and is included in selling, general\nand administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement. All of the payments in both 2023 and 2022 were\nmade to David Ludwig.\nNote 15 – Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved in various legal matters arising out of its operations in the normal course of\nbusiness, none of which are expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany.\nNote 16 – Stockholders’ Equity\nCapital Stock\nThe Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 300,000,000 common shares with a par value of $0.01 per\nshare and 10,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $10.00 per share.\nDuring 2023 and 2022 the Company issued 75,767 and 242,475 shares of common stock, respectively,\npursuant to the exercise of stock options.\nOn March 30, 2021, the Company and Scott West entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release\n(the “Separation Agreement”). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. West’s separation from the\nCompany was effective on March 31, 2021. On April 8, 2021, the Company granted 25,000 shares of the\nCompany’s restricted common stock, for which the restrictions lapsed on April 8, 2023. In addition, the Separation\nAgreement provides for customary mutual releases by the Company and Mr. West, and the Separation Agreement\nincludes confidentiality, non-disparagement and other obligations. The full amount of the restricted common stock\nwas expensed as of March 31, 2021 and there was no remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as\nof December 31, 2022.\nEach share of Series N preferred stock has a voting entitlement equal to 40 common shares, votes with the\ncommon stock on an as-converted basis and is senior to all other preferred stock of the Company. Dividends, if any,\nwill be paid on an as-converted basis equal to common stock dividends. The conversion value of each share of\nSeries N preferred stock is $1,000, and each share is convertible to 40 common shares at the rate of $25.00 per\ncommon share. The holders of shares of Series N preferred stock are entitled to liquidation preference over common\nstockholders equivalent to $1,000 per share. During 2023, two shares of the Company’s Series N preferred stock\nwere converted into 80 shares of the Company’s common stock. No shares of the Company’s Series N preferred\nstock were converted during 2022.\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had four active stock-based compensation plans which are described\nbelow. The fourth of these plans received approval at the Company’s 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and\nreplaces the 2016 Plan for awards made after June 8, 2022.\n2010 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan\nIn 2010, the Company’s Board approved the 2010 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan (the “2010 Plan”) to\ninduce certain key employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries who are in a position to contribute\nmaterially to the Company’s prosperity to remain with the Company, to offer such persons incentives and rewards in\nrecognition of their contributions to the Company’s progress, and to encourage such persons to continue to promote\nthe best interests of the Company. The Company reserved 1,250,000 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment\nunder certain circumstances) for issuance or transfer upon exercise of options granted under the 2010 Plan. Options\nF-27\nmay be issued under the 2010 Plan to any key employees or consultants selected by the Company’s Board (or an\nappropriately qualified committee). Options may not be granted with an exercise price less than the fair market\nvalue of the common stock of the Company as of the day of the grant. Options granted pursuant to the plan are\nsubject to limitations on transfer and execution and may be issued subject to vesting conditions. Options may also be\nforfeited in certain circumstances. During 2022 options to purchase 100,000 shares were granted to the Company’s\nexecutive and independent directors as part of their annual compensation. No awards under this plan were granted\nduring 2023.\n2010 Plan 2023 2022\nOptions outstanding, beginning of year 243,750 331,250\nOptions granted — 100,000\nOptions exercised (5,000) (147,500)\nOptions forfeited — (40,000)\nOptions outstanding, end of year 238,750 243,750\nThe outstanding options vest over four years at exercise prices ranging from $0.40 to $2.77 per share.\nOther Options Issued\nIn 2021, the Company’s Board approved the issuance of options to purchase 150,000 shares at an exercise\nprice of $1.78 to certain accredited personnel. In 2020, the Company’s Board approved the issuance of options to\npurchase 90,000 shares at an exercise price of $1.41 to certain accredited personnel. Shares issued upon exercise of\nthese options are not registered for public sale. No awards under this plan were granted during 2023 or 2022.\nOther Options 2023 2022\nOptions outstanding, beginning of year 383,125 404,375\nOptions issued — —\nOptions exercised — (21,250)\nOptions forfeited — —\nOptions outstanding, end of year 383,125 383,125\nThe outstanding options vest over four years at exercise prices ranging from $0.70 to $1.78 per share.\nHeritage Global Inc. 2016 Stock Option Plan\nIn 2016, the Company adopted the Heritage Global Inc. 2016 Stock Option Plan (the “2016 Plan”) which\nprovided for the issuance of incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options up to an aggregate of 3,150,000\nshares of common stock (subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, and other similar\nevents). Options may not be granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock of\nthe Company as of the day of the grant. Options granted pursuant to the plan are subject to limitations on transfer\nand execution and may be issued subject to vesting conditions. Options may also be forfeited in certain\ncircumstances. On June 8, 2022 the 2016 plan was replaced by the 2022 Heritage Global Inc. Equity Incentive Plan.\n2016 Plan 2023 2022\nOptions outstanding, beginning of year 1,255,975 1,457,663\nOptions granted — 35,000\nOptions exercised (91,750) (170,375)\nOptions forfeited (84,375) (66,313)\nOptions outstanding, end of year 1,079,850 1,255,975\nThe outstanding options under the 2016 Plan vest over four years at exercise prices ranging from $0.45 to\n$3.33 per share.\nF-28\n2022 Heritage Global Inc. Equity Incentive Plan\nIn 2022, at the Company's 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company's shareholders approved the\n2022 Heritage Global Inc. Equity Incentive Plan, which replaces the Heritage Global Inc. 2016 Plan and authorized\nthe issuance of an aggregate of 3.5 million shares of Common Stock for awards made after June 8, 2022. In 2023\nand 2022, the Company issued options to purchase 470,000 and 144,500 shares of common stock to certain of the\nCompany's employees under this plan, respectively.\n2022 Plan 2023 2022\nOptions outstanding, beginning of year 144,500 —\nOptions granted 470,000 144,500\nOptions exercised (5,375) —\nOptions forfeited (45,500) —\nOptions outstanding, end of year 563,625 144,500\nThe outstanding options under the 2022 Plan vest over four years at exercise prices ranging from $1.60 to\n$3.55 per share.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nTotal compensation cost related to stock options was $0.8 million in 2023 and $0.4 million in 2022. These\namounts were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in both years. During 2023 and 2022, options\nto purchase 102,125 and 339,125 shares were exercised, respectively. The tax benefit recognized by the Company\nrelated to these option exercises was approximately $2.6 million in 2023, as compared to $0.5 million recognized in\n2022.\nIn connection with the stock option grants during 2023 and 2022, the fair value of each option grant was\nestimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:\n2023 2022\nRisk-free interest rate 4% 2% - 3%\nExpected life (years) 7 6\nExpected volatility 65% 70%\nExpected dividend yield Zero Zero\nThe risk-free interest rates are those for U.S. Treasury constant maturities for terms matching the expected\nterm of the option. The expected life of the options is calculated according to the simplified method for estimating\nthe expected term of the options, based on the vesting period and contractual term of each option grant. Expected\nvolatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility. The Company has never paid a dividend on its common\nstock and therefore the expected dividend yield is zero.\nF-29\nThe following summarizes the changes in common stock options:\n2023 2022\nWeighted Weighted\nAverage Average\nExercise Exercise\nOptions Price Options Price\nOutstanding at beginning of year 2,027,350 $ 1.38 2,193,288 $ 1.23\nGranted 470,000 $ 2.91 279,500 $ 1.62\nExercised (102,125)$ 0.86 (339,125)$ 0.50\nForfeited (129,875)$ 1.72 (106,313)$ 1.79\nOutstanding at end of year 2,265,350 $ 1.71 2,027,350 $ 1.38\nOptions exercisable at year end 1,275,225 $ 1.02 1,023,975 $ 0.97\nWeighted-average fair value of options\ngranted\nduring the year $ 2.91 $ 1.62\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had unvested options for the purchase of 990,125 shares with a\nweighted average grant date fair value of $2.38 per share. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had unvested\noptions for the purchase of 1,003,375 shares with a weighted average grant date fair value of $1.80 per share.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock\noptions was $1.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years.\nThe total fair value of options vesting during 2023 and 2022 was $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nThe unvested options have no associated performance conditions. In general, the Company’s employee turnover is\nlow, and the Company expects that the majority of the unvested options will vest according to the standard four-year\ntimetable.\nThe following table summarizes information about all stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2023:\nWeighted Weighted Weighted Weighted\nAverage Average Average Average\nOptions Remaining Exercise Number Remaining Exercise\nExercise price Outstanding Life (years) Price Exercisable Life (years) Price\n$ 0.40 to $ 0.53 446,600 3.2 $ 0.45 446,600 3.2 $ 0.45\n$ 0.70 to $ 0.85 288,125 5.6 $ 0.77 280,625 5.6 $ 0.77\n$ 1.37 to $ 1.90 808,125 7.6 $ 1.67 388,000 7.4 $ 1.65\n$ 2.49 to $ 3.55 722,500 8.5 $ 2.91 160,000 7.1 $ 2.85\n2,265,350 1,275,225\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable options was $2.0 million and\n$1.5 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock awards represent a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in\naccordance with the participant’s award agreement. There is no exercise price and no monetary payment required for\nreceipt of restricted stock awards or the shares issued in settlement of the award. Instead, consideration is furnished\nin the form of the participant’s services to the Company. Compensation cost for these awards is based on the fair\nvalue of the shares of common stock on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period.\nF-30\nOn June 1, 2018, the Company granted 600,000 shares of Company restricted common stock in connection\nwith the Addenda to the Employment Agreements of David Ludwig and Tom Ludwig. The shares are subject to\ncertain restrictions on transfer and a right of repurchase over five years, which ended on May 31, 2023. Stock-based\ncompensation expense related to the restricted stock awards, calculated by using the grant date fair value of\n$0.43 per share, was $21,500 and $51,600 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $21,500 and there\nwas no unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2023.\nOn March 30, 2021, the Company and Scott West entered into a Separation Agreement and General Release\n(the “Separation Agreement”). Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. West’s separation from the\nCompany was effective on March 31, 2021. On April 8, 2021, the Company granted 25,000 shares of the\nCompany’s restricted common stock, which will be forfeited to the Company during the two years following the\neffective date of the Separation Agreement in the event Mr. West breaches the terms of the Separation Agreement.\nIn addition, the Separation Agreement provides for customary mutual releases by the Company and Mr. West, and\nthe Separation Agreement includes confidentiality, non-disparagement and other obligations. The full amount of the\nrestricted common stock was expensed as of March 31, 2021 and all restrictions were removed on April 8, 2023.\nOn August 3, 2022, the Company granted 115,000 shares of Company restricted common stock to non-\nexecutive directors under the 2022 Heritage Global Inc. Equity Incentive Plan. Of the shares of Company restricted\ncommon stock granted during 2022, 40,000 shares were granted with a vesting term that was completed prior to the\ngrant date due to a delay in the Company’s ability to grant such shares, and the remaining 75,000 shares vested in\nfull on March 31, 2023. We determined the fair value of the shares awarded by using the closing price of our\ncommon stock as of the grant date. Stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock awards,\ncalculated by using the grant date fair value of $1.58 per share, was $44,400 and $124,600 for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Equity Incentive Plan. The shares will vest in full on March\n31, 2024. We determined the fair value of the shares awarded by using the closing price of our common stock as of\nthe grant date. Stock-based compensation expense related to the restricted stock awards, calculated by using the\ngrant date fair value of $2.87 per share, was $175,800 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The unrecognized\nstock-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2023, was approximately $39,500.\nNote 17 – Segment Information\nThe Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The management approach\ndesignates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source\nof the Company’s reportable segments. The Company manages its business primarily on differentiated revenue\nstreams for services offered. The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Auction and Liquidation segment,\nRefurbishment & Resale segment, Brokerage segment, and Specialty Lending segment. The Auction and\nLiquidation segment, through HGP, operates as a global full-service auction, appraisal and asset advisory firm,\nincluding the acquisition of turnkey manufacturing facilities and used industrial machinery and equipment. The\nRefurbishment & Resale segment, through ALT, acquires, refurbishes and supplies specialized laboratory\nequipment. The Brokerage segment, through NLEX, brokers charged-off receivables in the U.S. and Canada on\nbehalf of financial institutions. The Specialty Lending segment, through HGC, provides specialty financing\nsolutions to investors in charged-off and nonperforming asset portfolios.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based primarily on operating income.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the reported segment operating income for ALT and HGC represents incremental\ncosts for managing these segments as part of their sister segments (HGP for ALT and NLEX for HGC). As such, the\nreported operating income for ALT and HGC does not represent their true standalone contribution, as the Company\ndoes not attempt to allocate existing fixed divisional overhead costs of the sister divisions to the newer segments.\nF-31\nSimilarly, corporate overhead cost is not allocated to the operating divisions for management reporting purposes.\nFurther, the Company does not utilize segmented asset information to evaluate the performance of its reportable\nsegments and does not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.\nThe following table sets forth operating income information for the Company's reportable segments (in\nthousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nIndustrial Assets Division:\nAuction and Liquidation $ 4,918 $ 7,979\nRefurbishment & Resale 2,847 1,187\nTotal divisional operating income 7,765 9,166\nFinancial Assets Division:\nBrokerage 8,946 4,709\nSpecialty Lending 1,862 1,213\nTotal divisional operating income 10,808 5,922\nCorporate & other operating loss (4,254) (3,968)\nConsolidated operating income $ 14,319 $ 11,120\nF-32\nBoard of Directors\nSamuel L.
