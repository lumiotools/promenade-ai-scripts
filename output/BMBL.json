(NASDAQ: BMBL) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We delivered on our financial objectives for the third quarter as we executed on our plans to reimagine Bumble App to enable the next generation of online-to-real-world connections,” said Lidiane Jones, CEO of Bumble Inc. “Our work is focused on strengthening our ecosystem, rolling out a rebalanced marketing approach to drive high-quality user growth, achieving a steady cadence of product releases, and evolving our revenue strategy to better align with customer value. Our work will take time, but our powerful brand, scale, technical infrastructure and healthy financial position provide us with a strong foundation to build toward our vision.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights:** **(All comparisons relative to the Third Quarter 2023)**\n\n  * Total Revenue decreased 0.7% to $273.6 million, compared to $275.5 million. This includes an unfavorable impact of $1.3 million from foreign currency movements year over year. \n    * Bumble App Revenue decreased 0.7% to $220.2 million, compared to $221.8 million. This includes an unfavorable impact of $0.9 million from foreign currency movements year over year. \n    * Badoo App and Other Revenue decreased 0.6% to $53.4 million, compared to $53.7 million. This includes an unfavorable impact of $0.4 million from foreign currency movements year over year. \n  * Total Paying Users increased to 4.3 million, compared to 3.8 million. \n  * Total Average Revenue per Paying User (\"ARPPU\") decreased to $21.17, compared to $23.42. \n  * Net loss was $849.3 million, which includes $892.2 million of non-cash impairment charges, compared to net earnings of $23.1 million, or 8.4% of revenue. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $82.6 million, or 30.2% of revenue, compared to $75.3 million, or 27.3% of revenue. \n\n\n\nInformation about Bumble's use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\n“We reported total revenue and Bumble App revenue within our Q3 outlook ranges, while our team’s strong operational focus led to Adjusted EBITDA that exceeded our outlook,” said Anu Subramanian, CFO of Bumble Inc. “Operating with discipline and generating solid cash flow enabled us to continue to return cash to our shareholders, while allowing us to invest in key initiatives to drive our long-term growth plans for our business.” \n\n**Key Operating Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were calculated excluding paying users and revenue generated from Official, advertising and partnerships or affiliates and, for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, excluding paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz are included in our key operating metrics. Prior period information and key operating metrics have not been recast to include paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Geneva is a non-revenue generating app as of September 30, 2024 and excluded from our key operating metrics. Please refer to the Definitions section for more information. \n\n**(In thousands, except ARPPU)** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nBumble App Paying Users  |  2,869.3  |  2,604.9   \nBadoo App and Other Paying Users  |  1,386.2  |  1,215.6   \nTotal Paying Users  |  4,255.5  |  3,820.5   \nBumble App Average Revenue per Paying User  |  $  |  25.58  |  $  |  28.38   \nBadoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User  |  $  |  12.03  |  $  |  12.79   \nTotal Average Revenue per Paying User  |  $  |  21.17  |  $  |  23.42   \n  \n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total cash and cash equivalents were $252.1 million and total debt was $618.0 million. \n\nThe Company concluded that it was necessary to perform an interim impairment test as of September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a sustained decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization. Based on the results of the test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $892.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Share Repurchase Program:**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $89.7 million of shares of Class A common stock under our previously announced $450.0 million share repurchase program. \n\nIn October 2024, the Company repurchased $30.0 million of shares of Class A common stock. \n\nAs of October 31, 2024, a total of $89.0 million remained available for repurchase under the program, subject to an approximately 3.1 million share repurchase limit which may be increased pursuant to authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors. \n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n\n_A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net earnings (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA margin growth to GAAP net earnings (loss) margin growth which is growth in GAAP net earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenue has not been provided for the outlook included herein as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net earnings (loss) cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expense requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on its future GAAP financial results._\n\nBumble anticipates the following for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024 and full year ending December 31, 2024: \n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024:**\n\n  * Total Revenue in the range of $256 million to $262 million, which includes: \n    * Bumble App Revenue of $207 million to $211 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $70 million to $73 million. \n\n\n\n**Full Year 2024:**\n\n  * Total Revenue in the range of $1,066 million to $1,072 million, which includes: \n    * Bumble App Revenue of $861 million to $865 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin growth of at least 200 basis points. \n\n\n\nActual results may differ materially from Bumble’s financial outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nBumble will host a live webcast of its conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, November 6, 2024. A webcast of the call and other information related to the call will be accessible on the Investors section of the Company’s website at [https://ir.bumble.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.bumble.com&esheet=54148255&newsitemid=20241106020307&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.bumble.com&index=1&md5=c7e9a40897e2c92c80bdb188e990763f). A webcast replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the live event. \n\n**Definitions**\n\nAs used in this press release, unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, the following terms have the following meanings. Our key metrics (Bumble App Paying Users, Badoo App and Other Paying Users, Total Paying Users, Bumble App Average Revenue per Paying User, Badoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User, and Total Average Revenue per Paying User) were calculated excluding paying users and revenue generated from Official, advertising and partnerships or affiliates and, for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, excluding paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz are included in our key operating metrics. Geneva is a non-revenue generating app as of September 30, 2024 and excluded from our key operating metrics. \n\nTotal Revenue is the sum of Bumble App Revenue and Badoo App and Other Revenue. \n\nTotal Paying Users is the sum of Bumble App Paying Users and Badoo App and Other Paying Users. \n\nTotal Average Revenue per Paying User or Total ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Total Revenue in any measurement period divided by the Total Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nBumble App Revenue is revenue derived from purchases or renewals of a Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app subscription plan and/or in-app purchases on Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app in the relevant period. \n\nBumble App Paying User is a user that has purchased or renewed a Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app subscription plan and/or made an in-app purchase on Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app in a given month. We calculate Bumble App Paying Users as a monthly average, by counting the number of Bumble App Paying Users in each month and then dividing by the number of months in the relevant measurement period. \n\nBumble App Average Revenue per Paying User or Bumble App ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Bumble App Revenue in any measurement period, divided by Bumble App Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nBadoo App and Other Revenue is revenue derived from purchases or renewals of a Badoo app subscription plan and/or in-app purchases on Badoo app in the relevant period, purchases on one of our other apps that we owned and operated in the relevant period, purchases on other third party apps that used our technology in the relevant period and advertising, partnerships or affiliates revenue in the relevant period. \n\nBadoo App and Other Paying User is a user that has purchased or renewed a subscription plan and/or made an in-app purchase on Badoo app in a given month or made a purchase on one of our other apps that we owned and operated in a given month, or made a purchase on other third-party apps that used our technology in the relevant period. We calculate Badoo App and Other Paying Users as a monthly average, by counting the number of Badoo App and Other Paying Users in each month and then dividing by the number of months in the relevant measurement period. \n\nBadoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User or Badoo App and Other ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Badoo App and Other Revenue in any measurement period divided by Badoo App and Other Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP, however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain expenses, including income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expenses, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and costs associated with our restructuring plan, as management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we believe free cash flow and free cash flow conversion provide useful information regarding how cash provided by (used in) operating activities compares to the capital expenditures required to maintain and grow our business, and our available liquidity, after funding such capital expenditures, to service our debt, fund strategic initiatives, effectuate discretionary share repurchases and strengthen our balance sheet, as well as our ability to convert our earnings to cash. Additionally, we believe such metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysis, ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating liquidity and debt-service capabilities. We calculate free cash flow and free cash flow conversion using methodologies that we believe can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is defined as net earnings (loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and restructuring costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. \n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. \n\nFree cash flow conversion represents free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. \n\nOperating cash flow conversion represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a percentage of net earnings (loss). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements reflecting the current views of management of Bumble Inc. with respect to, among other things, our operations, our financial performance, our industry and our business and other non-historical statements, including without limitation statements related to our strategic plans and initiatives (including our marketing approach, product releases and revenue strategy) and the statements in the “Financial Outlook” section of this press release.

Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n11/06/2024\n\n_Total Revenue Decreased 1% to $274 Million_ _B_ _umble App Revenue Decreased 1%_ _to $220 Million_ _Bumble App Paying Users Increased 10% to 2.9 Million; Grew 52,000 Quarter Over Quarter_\n\nAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  Bumble Inc. (NASDAQ: BMBL) today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n“We delivered on our financial objectives for the third quarter as we executed on our plans to reimagine Bumble App to enable the next generation of online-to-real-world connections,” said Lidiane Jones, CEO of Bumble Inc. “Our work is focused on strengthening our ecosystem, rolling out a rebalanced marketing approach to drive high-quality user growth, achieving a steady cadence of product releases, and evolving our revenue strategy to better align with customer value. Our work will take time, but our powerful brand, scale, technical infrastructure and healthy financial position provide us with a strong foundation to build toward our vision.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights:** **(All comparisons relative to the Third Quarter 2023)**\n\n  * Total Revenue decreased 0.7% to $273.6 million, compared to $275.5 million. This includes an unfavorable impact of $1.3 million from foreign currency movements year over year. \n    * Bumble App Revenue decreased 0.7% to $220.2 million, compared to $221.8 million. This includes an unfavorable impact of $0.9 million from foreign currency movements year over year. \n    * Badoo App and Other Revenue decreased 0.6% to $53.4 million, compared to $53.7 million. This includes an unfavorable impact of $0.4 million from foreign currency movements year over year. \n  * Total Paying Users increased to 4.3 million, compared to 3.8 million. \n  * Total Average Revenue per Paying User (\"ARPPU\") decreased to $21.17, compared to $23.42. \n  * Net loss was $849.3 million, which includes $892.2 million of non-cash impairment charges, compared to net earnings of $23.1 million, or 8.4% of revenue. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $82.6 million, or 30.2% of revenue, compared to $75.3 million, or 27.3% of revenue. \n\n\n\nInformation about Bumble's use of non-GAAP financial measures is provided below under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” \n\n“We reported total revenue and Bumble App revenue within our Q3 outlook ranges, while our team’s strong operational focus led to Adjusted EBITDA that exceeded our outlook,” said Anu Subramanian, CFO of Bumble Inc. “Operating with discipline and generating solid cash flow enabled us to continue to return cash to our shareholders, while allowing us to invest in key initiatives to drive our long-term growth plans for our business.” \n\n**Key Operating Metrics:**\n\nThe following metrics were calculated excluding paying users and revenue generated from Official, advertising and partnerships or affiliates and, for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, excluding paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz are included in our key operating metrics. Prior period information and key operating metrics have not been recast to include paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Geneva is a non-revenue generating app as of September 30, 2024 and excluded from our key operating metrics. Please refer to the Definitions section for more information. \n\n**(In thousands, except ARPPU)** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2024** |  **Three Months Ended September 30, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \nBumble App Paying Users  |  2,869.3  |  2,604.9   \nBadoo App and Other Paying Users  |  1,386.2  |  1,215.6   \nTotal Paying Users  |  4,255.5  |  3,820.5   \nBumble App Average Revenue per Paying User  |  $  |  25.58  |  $  |  28.38   \nBadoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User  |  $  |  12.03  |  $  |  12.79   \nTotal Average Revenue per Paying User  |  $  |  21.17  |  $  |  23.42   \n  \n**Balance Sheet:**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total cash and cash equivalents were $252.1 million and total debt was $618.0 million. \n\nThe Company concluded that it was necessary to perform an interim impairment test as of September 30, 2024, primarily as a result of a sustained decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization. Based on the results of the test, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $892.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Share Repurchase Program:**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $89.7 million of shares of Class A common stock under our previously announced $450.0 million share repurchase program. \n\nIn October 2024, the Company repurchased $30.0 million of shares of Class A common stock. \n\nAs of October 31, 2024, a total of $89.0 million remained available for repurchase under the program, subject to an approximately 3.1 million share repurchase limit which may be increased pursuant to authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors. \n\n**Financial Outlook:**\n\n_A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net earnings (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA margin growth to GAAP net earnings (loss) margin growth which is growth in GAAP net earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenue has not been provided for the outlook included herein as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net earnings (loss) cannot be calculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-based compensation expense requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are not currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses depends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on its future GAAP financial results._\n\nBumble anticipates the following for the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2024 and full year ending December 31, 2024: \n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024:**\n\n  * Total Revenue in the range of $256 million to $262 million, which includes: \n    * Bumble App Revenue of $207 million to $211 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $70 million to $73 million. \n\n\n\n**Full Year 2024:**\n\n  * Total Revenue in the range of $1,066 million to $1,072 million, which includes: \n    * Bumble App Revenue of $861 million to $865 million. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin growth of at least 200 basis points. \n\n\n\nActual results may differ materially from Bumble’s financial outlook as a result of, among other things, the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” below. \n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nBumble will host a live webcast of its conference call to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, November 6, 2024. A webcast of the call and other information related to the call will be accessible on the Investors section of the Company’s website at [https://ir.bumble.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fir.bumble.com&esheet=54148255&newsitemid=20241106020307&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fir.bumble.com&index=1&md5=c7e9a40897e2c92c80bdb188e990763f). A webcast replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of the live event. \n\n**Definitions**\n\nAs used in this press release, unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, the following terms have the following meanings. Our key metrics (Bumble App Paying Users, Badoo App and Other Paying Users, Total Paying Users, Bumble App Average Revenue per Paying User, Badoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User, and Total Average Revenue per Paying User) were calculated excluding paying users and revenue generated from Official, advertising and partnerships or affiliates and, for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, excluding paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023, paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz are included in our key operating metrics. Geneva is a non-revenue generating app as of September 30, 2024 and excluded from our key operating metrics. \n\nTotal Revenue is the sum of Bumble App Revenue and Badoo App and Other Revenue. \n\nTotal Paying Users is the sum of Bumble App Paying Users and Badoo App and Other Paying Users. \n\nTotal Average Revenue per Paying User or Total ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Total Revenue in any measurement period divided by the Total Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nBumble App Revenue is revenue derived from purchases or renewals of a Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app subscription plan and/or in-app purchases on Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app in the relevant period. \n\nBumble App Paying User is a user that has purchased or renewed a Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app subscription plan and/or made an in-app purchase on Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app in a given month. We calculate Bumble App Paying Users as a monthly average, by counting the number of Bumble App Paying Users in each month and then dividing by the number of months in the relevant measurement period. \n\nBumble App Average Revenue per Paying User or Bumble App ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Bumble App Revenue in any measurement period, divided by Bumble App Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period. \n\nBadoo App and Other Revenue is revenue derived from purchases or renewals of a Badoo app subscription plan and/or in-app purchases on Badoo app in the relevant period, purchases on one of our other apps that we owned and operated in the relevant period, purchases on other third party apps that used our technology in the relevant period and advertising, partnerships or affiliates revenue in the relevant period. \n\nBadoo App and Other Paying User is a user that has purchased or renewed a subscription plan and/or made an in-app purchase on Badoo app in a given month or made a purchase on one of our other apps that we owned and operated in a given month, or made a purchase on other third-party apps that used our technology in the relevant period. We calculate Badoo App and Other Paying Users as a monthly average, by counting the number of Badoo App and Other Paying Users in each month and then dividing by the number of months in the relevant measurement period. \n\nBadoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User or Badoo App and Other ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Badoo App and Other Revenue in any measurement period divided by Badoo App and Other Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period. \n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP, however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain expenses, including income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expenses, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and costs associated with our restructuring plan, as management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we believe free cash flow and free cash flow conversion provide useful information regarding how cash provided by (used in) operating activities compares to the capital expenditures required to maintain and grow our business, and our available liquidity, after funding such capital expenditures, to service our debt, fund strategic initiatives, effectuate discretionary share repurchases and strengthen our balance sheet, as well as our ability to convert our earnings to cash. Additionally, we believe such metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysis, ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating liquidity and debt-service capabilities. We calculate free cash flow and free cash flow conversion using methodologies that we believe can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. \n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is defined as net earnings (loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and restructuring costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. \n\nFree cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. \n\nFree cash flow conversion represents free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. \n\nOperating cash flow conversion represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a percentage of net earnings (loss). \n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements reflecting the current views of management of Bumble Inc. with respect to, among other things, our operations, our financial performance, our industry and our business and other non-historical statements, including without limitation statements related to our strategic plans and initiatives (including our marketing approach, product releases and revenue strategy) and the statements in the “Financial Outlook” section of this press release.

Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and\nuncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially\nfrom those indicated in these statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: our ability to retainexisting\nusers or attract new users and to convert users to paying users (including as a result of shifts in strategy); competition and\nchanges in the competitive landscape of our market; our ability to distribute our dating products through third parties, suchas\nApple App Store or Google Play Store, and offset related fees; our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brands; risks\nrelating to changes to our existing brands and products, or the introduction or acquisition of new brands or products; risks relating\nto certain of our international operations, including geopolitical conditions and successful expansion into new markets; the impact\nof data security breaches or cyber attacks on our systems and the costs of remediation related to any such incidents; challenges\nForward-Looking with properly managing the use of artificial intelligence; our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property\nrights and successfully defend against claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of third-party intellectual\nStatements property; our ability to comply with complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations relating to our business,\nincluding data privacy laws; our substantial indebtedness; affiliates of Blackstone Inc.’s (“Blackstone”) and our Founder’s control of\nus; the outsized voting rights of Blackstone and our Founder; the risk that we may experience impairments to our goodwill and\nintangible assets as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control; the risk that our recent global\nworkforce reduction and restructuring of our operations may not generate their intended benefits to the extent or as quickly as\nanticipated; our ability to attract, hire and retain a highly qualified and diverse workforce, or maintain our corporate culture;\nchanges in business or macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of lower consumer confidence in our business or in the\nonline dating industry generally, recessionary conditions, increased unemployment rates, stagnant or declining wages, changesin\ninflation or interest rates, geopolitical events, political unrest (which may be heightened in a U.S. presidential election year), armed\nconflicts, including conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, widespread health emergencies or pandemics and measures\ntaken in response, extreme weather events or natural disasters; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. For additional\ninformation on these and other factors that could cause Bumble’s actual results to differ materially from expected results, please\nsee our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023and our subsequent periodic filings, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. The\nforward-looking statements included in this communication are made only as of the date of this communication, and we\nundertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result ofnew information, future\ndevelopments or otherwise, except as required by law.\nQ3 2024 Earnings 2\nAs used in this communication, unless otherwise noted or the context requires otherwise, the following terms have the following\nmeanings. Our key metrics (Bumble App Paying Users, Badoo App and Other Paying Users, Total Paying Users, Bumble App\nAverage Revenue per Paying User, Badoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User, and Total Average Revenue per\nPaying User) were calculated excluding paying users and revenue generated from Official, advertising and partnerships or\naffiliates and, for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, excluding paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Beginning\nin the fourth quarter of 2023, paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz are included in our key operating metrics.Geneva\nis a non-revenue generating app as of September 30, 2024and excluded from our key operating metrics.\nTotal Revenueis the sum of Bumble App Revenue and Badoo App and Other Revenue.\nTotal Paying Usersis the sum of Bumble App Paying Users and Badoo App and Other Paying Users.\nTotal Average Revenue per Paying User or Total ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Total Revenue in any measurement\nperiod divided by the Total Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period.\nBumble App Revenueis revenue derived from purchases or renewals of a Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app subscription\nplan and/or in-app purchases on Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app in the relevant period.\nBumble App Paying Useris a user that has purchased or renewed a Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app subscription plan\nand/or made an in-app purchase on Bumble app or Bumble For Friends app in a givenmonth. We calculate Bumble App Paying\nUsers as a monthly average, by counting the number of Bumble App Paying Users in each month and then dividing by the\nDefinitions\nnumber of months in the relevant measurement period.\nBumble App Average Revenue per Paying User or Bumble App ARPPUis a metric calculated based on Bumble App Revenue in\nany measurement period, divided by Bumble App Paying Users in such period divided by the number of months in the period.\nBadoo App and Other Revenueis revenue derived from purchases or renewals of a Badoo app subscription plan and/or in-app\npurchases on Badoo app in the relevant period, purchases on one of our other apps that we owned and operated in the relevant\nperiod, purchases on other third partyapps that used our technology in the relevant period and advertising, partnerships or\naffiliates revenue in the relevant period.\nBadoo App and Other Paying Useris a user that has purchased or renewed a subscription plan and/or made an in-app\npurchase on Badoo app in a givenmonth or made a purchase on one of our other apps that we owned and operated in a given\nmonth, ormade a purchase on other third-party apps that used our technology in the relevant period. We calculate Badoo App\nand Other Paying Users as a monthly average, by counting the number of Badoo App and Other Paying Users in each month and\nthen dividing by the number of months in the relevant measurement period.\nBadoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User or Badoo App and Other ARPPU is a metric calculated based on Badoo\nApp and Other Revenue in any measurement period divided by Badoo App and Other Paying Users in such period divided by the\nnumber of months in the period.\nQ3 2024 Earnings 3\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP, however, management believes that certain non-GAAP\nfinancial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better\ncomparison of our performance across periods. These measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide visibility to the underlying continuing operating\nperformance by excluding the impact of certain expenses, including income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income)\nexpense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expenses, employer costs related to\nstock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn out liability, interest\nrate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance\nreimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement\n(benefit) expense, impairment loss and costs associated with our restructuring plan, as management does not believe\nthese expenses are representative of our core earnings.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, have\nlimitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our operating\nresults as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a\nsubstitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is defined as net earnings\n(loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense,\nNon-GAAP\nstock-based compensation expense, employer costs related to stock based compensation, foreign exchange (gain)\nloss, changes in fair value of contingent earn out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities,\nFinancial Measures transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of\nbusiness, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss and restructuring costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\nWith regards to the Adjusted EBITDA outlook provided herein, a reconciliation to GAAP net earnings (loss) has not been\nprovided as the quantification of certain items included in the calculation of GAAP net earnings (loss) cannot be\ncalculated or predicted at this time without unreasonable efforts. For example, the non-GAAP adjustment for stock-\nbased compensation expense requires additional inputs such as number of shares granted and market price that are\nnot currently ascertainable, and the non-GAAP adjustment for certain legal, tax and regulatory reserves and expenses\ndepends on the timing and magnitude of these expenses and cannot be accurately forecasted. For the same reasons,\nthe Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a\npotentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on its future GAAP financial results.\nThis communication should be read in conjunction with our earnings release and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nthird quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nPlease refer to “Reconciliation from GAAP to NON-GAAP Financial Measures” for reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial\nmeasures.\nQ3 2024 Earnings 4\nQ3 2024 Financial Highlights\nIn Millions, Except ARPPU Q3 2024 VS.

Bumble Inc. provides these\nservices through websites and applications that it owns and operates. Bumble Inc. (the “Company” or “Bumble”) was incorporated as\na Delaware corporation on October 5, 2020 for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering (“IPO”) and other related\ntransactions in order to operate the business of Buzz Holdings L.P. (“Bumble Holdings”) and its subsidiaries.\nPrior to the IPO and the Reorganization Transactions, Bumble Holdings L.P. (“Bumble Holdings”), a Delaware limited partnership,\nwas formed primarily as a vehicle to finance the acquisition (the “Sponsor Acquisition”) of a majority stake in Worldwide Vision\nLimited by a group of investment funds managed by Blackstone Inc. (“Blackstone” or our “Sponsor”). As Bumble Holdings did not\nhave any previous operations, Worldwide Vision Limited, a Bermuda exempted limited company, is viewed as the predecessor to\nBumble Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOn February 16, 2021, the Company completed its IPO and used the proceeds from the issuance to redeem shares of Class A common\nstock and purchase limited partnership interests of Bumble Holdings (“Common Units”) from entities affiliated with our Sponsor.\nIn connection with the IPO, the organizational structure was converted to an umbrella partnership-C-Corporation with Bumble Inc.\nbecoming the general partner of Bumble Holdings. The Reorganization Transactions were accounted for as a transaction between\nentities under common control. As a result, the financial statements for periods subsequent to the Sponsor Acquisition and prior to the\nIPO and the Reorganization Transactions have been adjusted to combine the previously separate entities for presentation purposes. As\nthe general partner, Bumble Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs, and through Bumble Holdings and its\nsubsidiaries, conducts the business. Bumble Inc. consolidates Bumble Holdings in its consolidated financial statements and reports a\nnoncontrolling interest related to the Common Units held by the pre-IPO owners that hold Common Units following the\nReclassification and the incentive units held by the Continuing Incentive Unitholders in the consolidated financial statements.\nAssuming the exchange of all outstanding Common Units for shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis under the\nexchange agreement entered into by holders of Common Units, there would be 158,767,246 shares of Class A common stock\noutstanding (which does not reflect any shares of Class A common stock issuable in exchange for as-converted Incentive Units or\nupon settlement of certain other interests) as of September 30, 2024.\nAll references to the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” in this report are to Bumble Inc.\nSecondary Offering\nOn March 8, 2023, the Company completed a secondary offering of 13.75 million shares of Class A common stock on behalf of\ncertain selling stockholders affiliated with Blackstone (the “Blackstone Selling Stockholders”) and the Founder at a price of $22.80\nper share. This transaction resulted in the issuance of 7.2 million shares of Class A common stock for the period ended March 31,\n2023, which were issued in exchange for Common Units held by the selling stockholders.\nBumble did not sell any shares of Class A common stock in the secondary offering and did not receive any of the proceeds from the\nsales. Bumble paid the costs associated with the sale of shares by the Blackstone Selling Stockholders and the Founder, net of the\nunderwriting discounts.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that accompany these notes include the financial statements of the\nCompany, all entities that are wholly-owned by the Company and all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial\ninterest. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements\nhave been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), consistent in all material respects\nwith those applied in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated statements and notes thereto included in the 2023 Form 10-K.\nA noncontrolling interest in a consolidated subsidiary represents the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable,\ndirectly or indirectly, to the Company. Noncontrolling interests are presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated\n13\nbalance sheets and the presentation of net earnings (loss) is modified to present earnings and other comprehensive income (loss)\nattributed to controlling and noncontrolling interests. The Company’s noncontrolling interest represents substantive profit-sharing\narrangements and profit and losses are attributable to controlling and noncontrolling interests using an attribution method.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Equity for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 include adjustments to\ncorrect non-controlling interest, additional paid-in capital and treasury stock related to repurchases of common stock and common\nunits during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company concluded the adjustment to\nbe immaterial to the condensed consolidated financial statements and noted that it has no impact on previously reported consolidated\nstatements of operations, comprehensive operations and cash flows.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nNote 2 - Summary of Selected Significant Accounting Policies\nIncluded below are selected significant accounting policies including those that were added or modified during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 as a result of new transactions entered into or the adoption of new accounting policies. See Note 2, Summary of\nSelected Significant Accounting Policies, within the annual consolidated financial statements in our 2023 Form 10-K for the full list of\nour significant accounting policies.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments, estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company’s significant estimates\nrelate to business combinations, asset impairments, potential obligations associated with legal contingencies, the fair value of\ncontingent consideration, the fair value of derivatives, stock-based compensation, tax receivable agreements, and income taxes.\nThese estimates are based on management’s best estimates and judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates,\njudgments and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management’s experience and other factors, including\nexpectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Uncertainty about these assumptions,\njudgments and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities\naffected in future periods.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in banks, cash on hand, cash in electronic money accounts, overnight deposits and investments\nin money market funds.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has classified the cash held in Russia as restricted cash due to the\nsanctions imposed by the Russia-Ukraine Conflict, which is included in “Other noncurrent assets” within the accompanying\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets.\nImpairment of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of net assets acquired. The Company\ntests for goodwill impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely\nthan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nDuring each annual impairment test, the Company has the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment includes, but is not limited to: (i) deterioration\nin macroeconomic conditions or changes in market competitiveness; (ii) significant changes in cash flows and cost factors; (iii)\nchanges in planned use of the assets; (iv) a significant decline in the Company’s stock price for a sustained period; and (v) a significant\nchange in the Company’s market capitalization relative to its net book value.\nAs a result of the qualitative assessment, if the Company determines that it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood)\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, it will perform a quantitative test by estimating the fair value of\nthe reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company records a goodwill impairment loss\nequal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\n14\nAlternatively, the Company is permitted to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the quantitative\nassessment.\nThe Company considers both the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The income approach\nutilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. The market approach utilizes comparable public company information and key valuation\nmultiples and considers a market control premium and guideline transactions, when applicable. The estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is highly sensitive to changes in management’s estimates and assumptions including, but not limited to, the revenue growth rate,\ndiscount rate and valuation multiples.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $197.2 million of goodwill impairment charges associated\nwith its reporting unit. See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net.\nImpairment of Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nThe Company tests intangible assets that are not amortized (i.e., indefinite-lived brands) for impairment at the asset level. Indefinite-\nlived intangibles are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible\nimpairment may exist. The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the asset is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is\nimpaired, it performs a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. If the fair value,\nwhich is based on expected future cash flows, exceeds the carrying value, the asset is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount\nexceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset\nover the fair value of the asset.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $670.3 million of impairment charges associated with\nindefinite-lived assets. See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets and Definite-lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment and right-of-use assets, and definite-lived intangible assets,\nwhich primarily consist of developed technology and definite-lived brands, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the lowest level\nfor which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The carrying value of such\nassets or asset groups is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and\neventual disposition of the asset or asset group. If the carrying value is deemed not to be recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded\nequal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets or asset group exceeds its fair value. The remaining estimated useful\nlives of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets are routinely reviewed and, if the estimate is revised, the remaining\nunamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded $24.7 million of impairment charges associated with the\nFruitz asset group. See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net.\nShare Repurchase Program\nShares repurchased pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program are held as treasury stock and reflected as a reduction of\nstockholders' equity within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Upon retirement, the share repurchases will\nreduce Class A common stock based on the par value of the shares and reduce its capital surplus for the excess of the repurchase price\nover the par value. In the event the Company still has an accumulated deficit balance, the excess over the par value will be applied to\n“Additional paid-in capital.” Once the Company has retained earnings, the excess will be charged entirely to retained earnings.\nDirect costs and excise tax obligations will be included in the cost of the repurchased shares in the Company’s condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. Reduction to the excise tax obligation associated with subsequent issuance of shares will be reflected as an\nadjustment to the excise tax previously recorded.\nIn May 2023, the Company announced that the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $150.0 million of its\noutstanding Class A common stock with repurchases under the program to be made on a discretionary basis from time to time, subject\nto general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or other means,\nincluding privately negotiated transactions. The Company announced increases in the share repurchase program authorized amount\nfrom $150.0 million to $300.0 million in November 2023 and from $300.0 million to $450.0 million in May 2024. During the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 14.2 million shares of Class A common stock for $89.7 million,\n15\nexcluding excise tax obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 19.5 million shares of\nClass A common stock and 2.0 million Common Units for $174.1 million, excluding excise tax obligations. There were no share\nrepurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company\nrepurchased 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for $20.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, a total of $119.0 million\nremained available for repurchase under the repurchase program. See Note 12, Related Party Transactions, for additional information\non share repurchases from Blackstone.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is primarily derived in the form of recurring subscriptions and in-app purchases. Subscription revenue is presented net of\ntaxes, refunds and credit card chargebacks. This revenue is initially deferred and is recognized using the straight-line method over the\nterm of the applicable subscription period. Revenue from lifetime subscriptions is deferred over the average estimated expected period\nof the subscriber relationship, which is currently estimated to be twelve months. Revenue from the purchase of in-app features is\nrecognized based on usage and estimated breakage revenue associated with unused in-app purchases. Unused in-app purchase fees\nexpire based on the terms of the underlying agreement and are recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant revenue\nreversal would not occur. The Company also earns revenue from online advertising and partnerships. Online advertising revenue is\nrecognized when an advertisement is displayed. Revenue from partnerships is recognized according to the contractual terms of the\npartnership.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no customers representing greater than 10% of total\nrevenue.\nFor the periods presented, revenue across apps was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBumble App $ 220,188 $ 221,785 $ 653,928 $ 624,039\nBadoo App and Other 53,417 53,725 156,067 154,154\nTotal Revenue $ 273,605 $ 275,510 $ 809,995 $ 778,193\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue consists of advance payments that are received or are contractually due in advance of the Company's performance.\nThe Company’s deferred revenue is reported on a contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The Company\nclassifies deferred revenue as current when the term of the applicable subscription period or expected completion of the performance\nobligation is one year or less. The deferred revenue balance is $45.3 million and $48.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively, all of which is classified as a current liability. During the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $3.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, which was included in the deferred revenue\nbalance at the beginning of each respective period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company\nrecognized revenue of $47.7 million and $45.0 million, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the\nbeginning of each respective period.\nRestructuring Charges\nRestructuring charges consist primarily of severance, relocation, asset impairment and other related costs. The Company evaluates the\nnature of these costs to determine if they relate to ongoing benefit arrangements, which are accounted for under ASC 712,\nCompensation - Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, or one-time benefit arrangements, which are accounted for under ASC 420,\nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations. The Company records a liability for ongoing employee termination benefits when it is probable\nthat an employee is entitled to them and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated. One-time employee termination costs\nare recognized when management has communicated the termination plan to employees, unless future service is required, in which\ncase the costs are recognized ratably over the future service period. All other related costs are recognized when incurred. Restructuring\ncharges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated statements of operations and are classified based on each\nemployee’s respective function. See Note 6, Restructuring Charges, for additional information on restructuring charges.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07,\nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The ASU expands public entities’ segment\ndisclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\n16\nand included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment\nitems, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company beginning\nin fiscal year 2024 and interim periods beginning in the first quarter of 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Taxes Disclosures. The ASU\nrequires entities to provide disaggregated income tax disclosures on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid on an annual basis.\nASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-01, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits\nInterest and Similar Awards. The ASU clarifies how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is within the scope\nof Topic 718 or is not a share-based payment arrangement and therefore within the scope of other guidance. Entities can apply the\namendments either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements or prospectively to profits interest and\nsimilar awards granted or modified on or after the date of adoption. If prospective application is elected, an entity must disclose the\nnature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. ASU 2024-01 is effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter\nof 2025. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements and\ndisclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation\nDisclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which is intended to improve the disclosures of\nexpenses by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The standard\nrequires breaking down expenses into specific categories, such as employee compensation and costs related to depreciation and\namortization, as well as a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately\ndisaggregated quantitatively. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expense and, in annual reporting periods,\nan entity’s definition of selling expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2027 and interim periods\nbeginning in fiscal year 2028, either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date or\nretrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently\nevaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nThe Company considers the applicability and impact of all recently issued accounting pronouncements. Recent accounting\npronouncements not specifically identified in our disclosures are not applicable to the Company.\nNote 3 - Income Taxes\nThe Company is subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes and files consolidated income tax returns for U.S. federal and certain\nstate jurisdictions with respect to its allocable share of any net taxable income of Bumble Holdings. The subsidiaries of Bumble\nHoldings are also subject to income taxes in the foreign jurisdictions in which they operate.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was (0.5)% and (2.1)%, respectively, which\ndiffers from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to a valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax benefits\nassociated with pre-tax losses in these periods in addition to the tax impacts associated with the geographical distribution of our\nearnings, income attributable to noncontrolling interests, nondeductible stock-based compensation, and Pillar Two minimum taxes.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, our effective tax rate was 7.5% and 19.3%, respectively, which differs from\nthe U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to the geographical distribution of our earnings, income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests, nondeductible stock-based compensation, and a valuation allowance recorded against certain deferred tax\nassets arising in the current year.\nNote 4 - Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the Reorganization Transactions and our IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of our pre-\nIPO owners that provides for the payment by the Company to such pre-IPO owners of 85% of the benefits that the Company realizes,\nor is deemed to realize, as a result of the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in our IPO and other tax benefits\nrelated to entering into the tax receivable agreement. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon\ncontinued ownership of the Company by the pre-IPO owners.\nWe have determined that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize tax benefits related to certain basis adjustments and\nacquired net operating losses that were received in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and our IPO. As a result of this\ndetermination, we have not recorded the benefit of these deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024. At the time of the Sponsor\n17\nAcquisition, the assets and liabilities of Bumble Holdings were adjusted to fair value on the closing date of the business combination\nfor both financial reporting and income tax purposes. As a result of the IPO, we inherited certain tax benefits associated with this\nstepped-up basis (“Common Basis”) created when certain pre-IPO owners acquired their interests in Bumble Holdings in the Sponsor\nAcquisition. This Common Basis entitles us to the depreciation and amortization deductions previously allocable to the pre-IPO\nowners. Based on current projections, we anticipate having sufficient taxable income to be able to realize the benefit of this Common\nBasis and have recorded a tax receivable agreement liability to related parties of $413.0 million related to these benefits as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. To the extent that we determine that we are able to realize the tax benefits associated with the basis adjustments\nand net operating losses, we would record an additional liability of $290.4 million for a total liability of $703.4 million. If, in the\nfuture, we are not able to utilize the Common Basis, we would record a reduction in the tax receivable agreement liability to related\nparties that would result in a benefit recorded within our consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, our tax receivable agreement liability decreased by a net $17.2 million due to the following: (1) a $23.1 million\ndecrease from tax receivable agreement payments made during the first quarter of 2024, and (2) a partially offsetting net increase of\n$5.9 million, primarily due to the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Blackstone entities completed\nin the first quarter of 2024 and the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Bumble during 2024, the\nproceeds from which were used to fund Class A common stock repurchases during 2024.\nNote 5 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the period presented are as follows (in thousands):\nAccumulated\nGross Carrying Impairment Net Carrying\nAmount Losses Amount\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ 1,585,750 $ — $ 1,585,750\nImpairment charge — (197,214) (197,214)\nForeign currency translation adjustment 466 — 466\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,586,216 $ (197,214) $ 1,389,002\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company identified potential impairment triggering events indicating that the\nfair value of its reporting unit was more likely than not less than its carrying value. These triggering events included the Company’s\nrevised 2024 outlook and a decrease in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization that was sustained during the third quarter\nof 2024. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment\ntest. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of two approaches, an income approach, employing a\ndiscounted cash flow model, and a market approach, employing a guideline public company approach. These valuation approaches\nrequire the Company to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of expected cash flows, including, but not limited\nto, the revenue growth rate, the discount rate and valuation multiples. As a result of this impairment test, the Company recognized a\ngoodwill impairment charge of $197.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of the\nCompany’s reporting unit was impacted by its revised forecast, as well as adverse macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to,\nslower economic growth, a higher cost of borrowing, inflationary pressures, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. There\nwere no impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nA summary of the Company’s intangible assets, net is as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGross Accumulated Net Remaining\nCarrying Accumulated Impairment Carrying Useful\nAmount Amortization Losses Amount Life (Years)\nBrands - indefinite-lived $ 1,511,269 $ — $ (811,269) $ 700,000 Indefinite\nBrands - definite-lived 43,736 (7,779) (23,854) 12,103 5.0\nDeveloped technology 266,714 (232,440) (1,043) 33,231 2.1\nUser base 113,770 (113,388) — 382 0.3\nWhite label contracts 33,384 (6,953) (26,431) — —\nOther 32,867 (14,177) — 18,690 3.8\nTotal Intangible assets, net $ 2,001,740 $ (374,737) $ (862,597) $ 764,406\n18\nDecember 31, 2023\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGross Accumulated Net Remaining\nCarrying Accumulated Impairment Carrying Useful\nAmount Amortization Losses Amount Life (Years)\nBrands - indefinite-lived $1,511,269 $ — $ (141,000) $ 1,370,269 Indefinite\nBrands - definite-lived 43,309 (5,301) — 38,008 12.3\nDeveloped technology 249,470 (193,777) — 55,693 1.1\nUser base 113,760 (113,154) — 606 0.5\nWhite label contracts 33,384 (6,953) (26,431) — —\nOther 28,549 (8,835) — 19,714 3.9\nTotal Intangible assets, net $1,979,741 $ (328,020) $ (167,431) $ 1,484,290\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization indicated that\nthe fair value of the Company's indefinite-lived assets was more likely than not less than its carrying value. The Company evaluated\nthe fair value of its indefinite-lived assets by using the relief from royalty methodology based on management’s assumptions. This\nvaluation approach requires the Company to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of expected cash flows,\nincluding, but not limited to, the revenue growth rate, royalty rate, and discount rate. As a result, the Company recognized an\nimpairment charge of $670.3 million associated with the indefinite-lived assets during the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024, representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAdditionally, the Company assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets at the asset group\nlevel and determined that the carrying value of the Fruitz asset group was not recoverable. The Company then evaluated the fair value\nof the Fruitz asset group using a discounted cash flow method, which required the Company to make various assumptions, including,\nbut not limited to, the revenue growth rate and discount rate. As a result of this impairment test, the Company recognized $24.7\nmillion of impairment charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The impairment charges were allocated to\nthe Fruitz asset group on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets.\nAdditionally, the Company revised the remaining useful life of certain definite-lived intangible assets of Fruitz.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nOn July 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Geneva Technologies, Inc. (“Geneva”) for total cash consideration of\n$17.5 million (the “Purchase Consideration”), net of cash acquired. The principal assets of Geneva, which is a pre-revenue company,\nare a social networking and communications platform for building friendship and community and related intellectual property rights.\nAs substantially all of the fair value of the acquired assets was concentrated in Geneva’s developed technology, the transaction did not\nmeet the definition of a business combination. As such, the Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition in\naccordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations. The Purchase Consideration was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities\nbased on their relative fair values, with $17.2 million allocated to developed technology, which will be amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over four years, and $0.3 million allocated to other assets and liabilities.\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $16.4 million and\n$14.9 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $47.1 million and $43.8 million,\nrespectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024, amortization of intangible assets with definite lives is estimated to be as follows (in thousands):\nRemainder of 2024 $ 16,281\n2025 18,260\n2026 10,655\n2027 8,346\n2028 and thereafter 9,870\nTotal $ 63,412\nNote 6 - Restructuring Charges\nOn February 27, 2024, the Company announced that it adopted a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) to reduce its global\nworkforce by approximately 350 roles to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities and to drive stronger operating\nleverage. The Restructuring Plan was completed in the third quarter of 2024, and the Company incurred approximately $20.4 million\n19\nof total non-recurring charges through the third quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of employee severance, benefits, and related\ncharges for impacted employees. The following table presents the total non-recurring restructuring charges by function for the periods\nindicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nCost of revenue $ (34) $ 972\nSelling and marketing (3) 3,244\nGeneral and administrative 21 6,093\nProduct development 598 10,046\nTotal $ 582 $ 20,355\nThe Company did not record any restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30,\n2024, the remaining $1.3 million restructuring liability consists primarily of accrued severance costs, which are included in \"Accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities\" in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the restructuring-related liabilities (in thousands):\nEmployee Related Benefits Other Total\nBalance as of December 31, 2023 $ — $ — $ —\nRestructuring charges 19,032 1,323 20,355\nCash payments (17,875) (1,212) (19,087)\nBalance as of September 30, 2024 $ 1,157 $ 111 $ 1,268\nNote 7 - Other Financial Data\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Information\nOther current assets are comprised of the following balances (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCapitalized aggregator fees $ 11,497 $ 12,390\nPrepayments 12,179 9,831\nOther current assets 5,049 12,511\nTotal other current assets $ 28,725 $ 34,732\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities are comprised of the following balances (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLegal liabilities $ 39,718 $ 65,761\nPayroll and related expenses 23,323 29,355\nMarketing expenses 29,781 22,622\nProfessional fees 6,401 8,724\nLease liabilities 2,552 1,171\nIncome tax payable 9,049 958\nContingent earn-out liability 726 22,758\nPayable to related parties pursuant to a tax receivable agreement — 22,807\nOther accrued expenses and other payables 13,533 11,643\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 125,083 $ 185,799\nOther long-term liabilities are comprised of the following balances (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nLease liabilities $ 11,368 $ 13,273\nOther liabilities 2,025 1,434\nTotal other liabilities $ 13,393 $ 14,707\n20\nNote 8 - Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables present the Company’s financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nTotal Fair\nValue\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measurements\nAssets:\nCash equivalent - money market funds $ 109,548 $ — $ — $ 109,548\nDerivative asset — 1,293 — 1,293\nInvestments in equity securities — — 1,667 1,667\n$ 109,548 $ 1,293 $ 1,667 $ 112,508\nLiabilities:\nContingent earn-out liability $ — $ — $ 726 $ 726\n$ — $ — $ 726 $ 726\nDecember 31, 2023\nTotal Fair\nValue\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measurements\nAssets:\nCash equivalent - money market funds $ 237,087 $ — $ — $ 237,087\nDerivative asset — 8,288 — 8,288\nInvestments in equity securities — — 1,735 1,735\n$ 237,087 $ 8,288 $ 1,735 $ 247,110\nLiabilities:\nContingent earn-out liability $ — $ — $ 22,758 $ 22,758\n$ — $ — $ 22,758 $ 22,758\nThere were no transfers between levels between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nThe carrying value of accounts receivable, accounts payable, income tax payable, accrued expenses and other payables approximate\ntheir fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\nThe Company uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk related to fluctuating cash flows from interest rate changes\non the debt. These instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are recorded in “Other current assets,” “Other\nnoncurrent assets,” “Accrued expense and other current liabilities” or “Other long-term liabilities,” with changes in fair value\nrecognized in “Other income (expense), net.” The Company's derivative asset, which consists of interest rate swaps, is measured at fair\nvalue on a recurring basis using observable market data (Level 2) and totaled $1.3 million and $8.3 million as of September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated using a combined income and market-based\nvaluation methodology based on Level 2 inputs, including forward interest rate yield curves obtained from independent pricing\nservices. Derivative assets are included in “Other noncurrent assets” as of September 30, 2024 and “Other current assets” as of\nDecember 31, 2023 in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s contingent earn-out liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level\n3) and totaled $0.7 million and $22.8 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Contingent earn-out\nliability is included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there is a contingent consideration arrangement, consisting of an earn-out payment to former shareholders\nof Worldwide Vision Limited of up to $150.0 million. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability by\nusing a probability-weighted analysis to determine the amount of the liabilities, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature,\napplying a discount rate that captures the risks associated with the duration of the obligation. The number of scenarios in the\nprobability-weighted analyses vary; generally, more scenarios are prepared for longer duration and more complex arrangements. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability reflects a risk-free rate of 4.2% and\n5.0%, respectively.\nThe Company classified contingent earn-out arrangements as liabilities at the time of the acquisition, as they will be settled in cash,\nand remeasures the fair values of the contingent earn-out liabilities each reporting period thereafter until settled. The fair value of the\ncontingent earn-out liabilities are sensitive to changes in the stock price, discount rates and the timing of the future payments, which\n21\nare based upon estimates of future achievement of the performance metrics. Changes in fair values of contingent earn-out liabilities\nare recognized in “General and administrative expense” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. The\nchange in fair value of the contingent earn-out liability was $(2.7) million and $(11.3) million for the three months ended September\n30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $(22.0) million and $(24.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived\nassets, definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded\nimpairment charges of $670.3 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets, $24.7 million for the Fruitz asset group and $197.2 million\nfor goodwill. The Company determined the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Fruitz long-lived assets and definite-lived\nintangible assets and its reporting unit for goodwill impairment using unobservable inputs (Level 3). Refer to Note 2, Summary of\nSelected Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net.\nNote 9 - Debt\nTotal debt is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTerm Loan due January 29, 2027 $ 622,750 $ 627,063\nLess: unamortized debt issuance costs 4,769 6,137\nLess: current portion of debt, net 5,750 5,750\nTotal long-term debt, net $ 612,231 $ 615,176\nCredit Agreements\nOn January 29, 2020, the Company and the wholly-owned subsidiaries, Buzz Bidco LLC, Buzz Merger Sub Limited, and Buzz Finco\nLLC (the “Borrower”) entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which permitted the Company to borrow up to\n$625.0 million through a seven-year $575.0 million term loan (“Original Term Loan”), as well as a five-year senior secured revolving\ncredit facility of $50.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and $25.0 million available through letters of credit.\nOn October 19, 2020, the Company entered into the Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, which provides for incremental\nborrowing of an aggregate principal amount of $275.0 million (the “Incremental Term Loan,” and collectively with the Original Term\nLoan, the “Term Loans”).\nOn March 20, 2023, in connection with a Benchmark Discontinuation Event, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the\nCredit Agreement (“Amendment No. 2”), which provided for the transition of the benchmark interest rate from LIBOR to the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) pursuant to benchmark replacement provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the\nterms of Amendment No. 2, effective with the interest period beginning March 31, 2023, LIBOR was replaced with Term SOFR, a\nforward-looking term rate based on SOFR, plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% with respect to the Term Loans and 0.00% with\nrespect to loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (Term SOFR plus such credit spread adjustment, “Adjusted Term SOFR”). All\nother terms of the Credit Agreement unrelated to the benchmark replacement and its incorporation were unchanged by Amendment\nNo. 2. Effective March 31, 2023 all Term Loans outstanding are bearing interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR and there were no\nRevolving Credit Loans outstanding.\nBased on the calculation of the applicable consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, the applicable margin for borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility is between 1.00% to 1.50% with respect to base rate borrowings and between 2.00% and 2.50% with respect\nto (i) prior to March 31, 2023, LIBOR rate borrowings and (ii) on or after April 1, 2023, Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings. The\napplicable commitment fee under the revolving credit facility is between 0.375% and 0.500% per annum based upon the consolidated\nfirst lien net leverage ratio. The Borrower must also pay customary letter of credit fees and an annual administrative agency fee.\nThe interest rates in effect for the Original Term Loan and the Incremental Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 were 8.10% and\n8.60%, respectively. The Original Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to\n1.00% of the principal amount of the Original Term Loan Facility outstanding as of the date of the closing of the Original Term Loan\nFacility, with the balance being payable at maturity on January 29, 2027. The Incremental Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal\nquarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the Incremental Term Loan Facility\noutstanding as of the date of the closing of the Incremental Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable at maturity on January\n29, 2027. Following the $200.0 million aggregate principal payment of amount of outstanding indebtedness during the three months\nended March 31, 2021 quarterly installment payments on the Incremental Term Loan Facility are no longer required for the remaining\n22\nterm of the facility. Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full at maturity on\nJanuary 29, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, and at all times during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company was in\ncompliance with the financial debt covenants.\nAs the loans are issued with a floating rate of interest, the Company believes that the fair value of the obligations is approximated by\nthe principal amount of the loans as of September 30, 2024. The carrying value of the Term Loans includes the outstanding principal\namount, less unamortized debt issuance costs. Therefore, the Company assumes the carrying value of the debt, before any transaction\ncosts, would closely approximate the fair value of the loan obligation with the assumptions above.\nNote 10 - Earnings (Loss) per Share\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of the numerators used to compute the Company's basic and diluted earnings (loss) per\nshare (in thousands):\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNumerator:\nNet earnings (loss) $ (849,259) $ 23,124 $ (777,700) $ 30,144\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (236,060) 6,453 (216,513) 8,331\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Bumble Inc. shareholders $ (613,199) $ 16,671 $ (561,187) $ 21,813\nThe following table sets forth the computation of the Company's basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except share\namounts, and per share amounts):\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBasic earnings (loss) per share attributable to common\nstockholders\nNumerator\nAllocation of net earnings (loss) attributable to Bumble Inc.\nshareholders $ (613,410) $ 16,671 $ (566,666) $ 21,461\nLess: net earnings (loss) attributable to participating securities — 9 — 14\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (613,410) $ 16,662 $ (566,666) $ 21,447\nDenominator\nWeighted average number of shares of Class A common stock\noutstanding 120,091,564 136,457,412 125,006,154 135,185,151\nBasic earnings (loss) per share attributable to common\nstockholders $ (5.11) $ 0.12 $ (4.53) $ 0.16\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common\nstockholders\nNumerator\nAllocation of net earnings (loss) attributable to Bumble Inc.\nshareholders $ (613,410) $ 16,487 $ (566,666) $ 21,199\nIncrease in net earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders\nupon conversion of potentially dilutive Common Units — 6,637 — 8,945\nLess: net earnings (loss) attributable to participating securities — 9 — 14\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to common stockholders $ (613,410) $ 23,115 $ (566,666) $ 30,130\nDenominator\nNumber of shares used in basic computation 120,091,564 136,457,412 125,006,154 135,185,151\nAdd: weighted-average effect of dilutive securities\nRSUs — 1,375,772 — 1,244,705\nCommon Units to convert to Class A Common Stock — 53,584,628 — 55,831,913\nWeighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding\nused to calculate diluted earnings (loss) per share 120,091,564 191,417,812 125,006,154 192,261,769\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to common\nstockholders $ (5.11) $ 0.12 $ (4.53) $ 0.16\n23\nThe following table sets forth potentially dilutive securities that were excluded from the diluted earnings (loss) per share computation\nbecause the effect would be anti-dilutive, or issuance of such shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which\nwere not satisfied by the end of the periods:\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded September Ended September Ended September Ended September\n30, 2024 30, 2023 30, 2024 30, 2023\nTime-vesting awards:\nOptions 4,950,211 3,844,085 4,950,211 3,844,085\nRestricted shares 6,444 — 6,444 —\nRSUs 5,770,886 2,252,668 5,770,886 2,280,638\nIncentive units 959,056 401,614 959,056 366,393\nTotal time-vesting awards 11,686,597 6,498,367 11,686,597 6,491,116\nExit-vesting awards:\nOptions 58,062 79,908 58,062 79,908\nRestricted shares 5,537 — 5,537 —\nRSUs 127,464 — 127,464 —\nIncentive units 884,325 958,133 884,325 1,012,768\nTotal exit-vesting awards 1,075,388 1,038,041 1,075,388 1,092,676\nTotal 12,761,985 7,536,408 12,761,985 7,583,792\nNote 11 -

The Company maintains a directors and officers insurance policy to provide coverage in the event of a claim against an\nofficer or director.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to various legal proceedings, claims, and governmental inspections, audits or investigations arising out of our business\nwhich cover matters such as general commercial, consumer protection, governmental regulations, product liability, privacy, safety,\nenvironmental, intellectual property, employment and other actions that are incidental to our business, including a number of\ntrademark proceedings, both offensive and defensive, regarding the BUMBLE, BADOO and FRUITZ marks.\nThese actions frequently seek putative damages that may significantly exceed our assessment of any reasonably possible loss from the\nresolution of such actions. We record a liability for legal claims when the Company determines that a loss is probable and the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated, and, if the liability is material, we disclose the amount of the liability reserved. Except as otherwise\ndisclosed below, while it is reasonably possible that a loss for a particular matter may be incurred in excess of recorded amounts as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued cannot be\nmade at this time.\n27\nThese matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and it is possible that an unfavorable outcome of one or more of these legal\nproceedings or other contingencies could have a material impact on the business, financial condition, or results of operations of the\nCompany.\nLitigation Related to the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act (the “BIPA”)\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, four putative class action lawsuits were filed against the Company alleging that certain features of the\nBadoo or Bumble apps violate the Illinois BIPA. Each of these lawsuits allege that the apps used facial geometry scans in violation of\nBIPA’s authorization, consent, and data retention policy provisions. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek statutory damages, compensatory\ndamages, attorneys’ fees, injunctive relief, and (in one action) punitive damages. The parties reached a proposed class action\nsettlement in these lawsuits, which were consolidated on May 30, 2024. The settlement was preliminarily approved on June 6, 2024,\nand the Court entered a final approval order as to the settlement on October 24, 2024.\nBetween September 2023 and March 2024, the Company received approximately 29,000 pre-arbitration demands regarding Bumble’s\nalleged violation of BIPA. The parties reached settlements to resolve all of these individual demands, and the settlements have been\nfully paid as of August 1, 2024.\nAn accrual has been made based on the probable and estimable loss in connection with the aforementioned class and individual\nmatters. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded nil and $2.5 million, respectively, in costs in\nconnection with the aforementioned class and individual matters.\nIn February 2024, an additional class action lawsuit was filed in Illinois alleging that certain features of Bumble app violate BIPA. The\ncase has been administratively terminated pending resolution of the plaintiff’s individual claims in arbitration.\nProceedings Related to the September 2021 Secondary Public Stock Offering (the “SPO”)\nSix shareholder derivative complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, United\nStates District Court for the District of Delaware and Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain directors and\nofficers asserting claims under the U.S. federal securities laws that the Registration Statement and prospectus used for the SPO\ncontained false and misleading statements or omissions by failing to disclose certain information concerning Bumble and Badoo app\npaying users and related trends and issues with the Badoo app payment platform, and that as a result of the foregoing, Bumble’s\nbusiness metrics and financial prospects were not as strong as represented in the SPO Registration Statement and prospectus. The\nGlover-Mott shareholder derivative complaint was filed in April 2022 in federal court. The Michael Schirano shareholder derivative\ncomplaint was filed in May 2023 in federal court. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware ordered the two actions\nconsolidated in August 2023 under the caption In Re Bumble Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation. An amended consolidated\ncomplaint was filed in August 2023 alleging violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and\nRule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act, as well as for breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust\nenrichment against, among others, management, our Board of Directors and Blackstone. The complaint seeks unspecified damages;\nrescission of certain employment agreements between the individual defendants and the Company, disgorgement from defendants of\nany improperly or unjustly obtained profits or benefits; an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys’ fees;\npunitive damages; pre- and post-judgment interest, and that the Company be directed to take action to reform its corporate governance\nand internal procedures.\nTwo federal court shareholder derivative complaints were voluntarily dismissed in July 2023.\nIn January 2023 and February 2023, purported shareholders Alberto Sanchez and City of Vero Beach Police Officers’ Retirement Trust\nFund, respectively, filed shareholder derivative complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In March 2023, the Delaware Court of\nChancery consolidated those actions under the caption In re Bumble Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation. In April 2023, the\nconsolidated action plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment\nagainst, among others, management, our Board of Directors, and Blackstone. The complaint seeks unspecified damages; a finding that\nthe individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties; disgorgement from defendants of any unjustly obtained profits or benefits;\nand an award of costs and disbursement, including attorneys’ fees, accountants’ fees, and experts’ fees. In October 2023, the court\ndenied defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint.\nIn August 2023, Bumble received litigation demands from (i) counsel representing the purported Bumble shareholder who filed the\nvoluntarily dismissed William B. Federman Irrevocable Trust derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware\nand (ii) counsel representing the purported Bumble shareholder who filed the voluntarily dismissed Dana Messana derivative action in\nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Both litigation demands are directed to the Bumble Board and contain factual\nallegations involving the September 2021 SPO that are generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and\nfederal court. The letters demand, among other things, that Bumble’s Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal\nviolations, and that Bumble commence a civil action to pursue related claims against any individuals who allegedly harmed Bumble.\nIn November 2023, Bumble formed a Special Litigation Committee (“SLC”) to investigate the claims at-issue in the In Re Bumble\n28\nInc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Delaware Court of\nChancery, as well as the William B. Federman Irrevocable Trust and Dana Messana litigation demands. In January 2024, the Delaware\nCourt of Chancery entered an order staying the litigation for 180 days to allow the SLC to conduct its investigation, and the United\nStates District Court for the District of Delaware so-ordered a stipulation similarly staying the litigation until July 15, 2024 to allow\nthe SLC to conduct its investigation. In June 2024, the stay was extended by 10 days to July 25, 2024 in both the United States District\nCourt for the District of Delaware and the Delaware Court of Chancery. On July 25, 2024, the SLC submitted a report of its factual\nfindings and legal analysis. The SLC determined that terminating and dismissing the litigation would best serve the interests of the\nCompany and its stockholders. The SLC moved to terminate and dismiss with prejudice the litigation pending in the Delaware Court\nof Chancery, and pursuant to prior Court Order, agreed to meet and confer with the parties to the litigation pending in the United\nStates District Court for the District of Delaware concerning proposed next steps in that litigation, including a motion by the SLC to\ndismiss the litigation. The SLC also informed counsel for the shareholders who brought litigation demands (William B. Federman\nIrrevocable Trust and Dana Messana) of its findings. In October 2024, the United States Court for the District of Delaware granted a\nstay of the litigation pending a decision on the SLC’s forthcoming motion to terminate the Delaware Court of Chancery action.\nManagement is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring.\nThe Company has also received an inquiry from the SEC relating to the disclosures that were at issue in the SPO class action that has\nsince been settled by the Company. The Company cannot predict at this point the length of time that the inquiry will be ongoing, the\noutcome or the liability, if any, that may arise therefrom.\nProceedings Related to the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (the \"Unruh Act\")\nOn April 9, 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Central\nDistrict of California, also alleging that Bumble’s “women message first” feature violates the Unruh Act. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits\nsought declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs. On July 8, 2024, the named plaintiffs filed a\nnotice voluntarily dismissing the action without prejudice.\nOn August 16, 2024, the named plaintiffs refiled their Unruh Act claims in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County\nof Riverside, this time naming as defendants both the Company and its founder, Executive Chair and former CEO Whitney Wolfe\nHerd. Similar to the action filed on April 9, 2024, the litigation is a putative class action in which the named plaintiffs allege that the\n“women message first” feature violates the Unruh Act. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory damages, and\nattorneys’ fees and costs. On October 9, 2024, the action was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia, where it is currently pending.\nProceedings Related to 2024 Financial Results\nIn September 2024, a purported securities class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District\nof Texas, naming the Company and certain of its current executives and directors as defendants. The complaint asserts claims under\nSections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, alleging that the defendants made or disseminated materially false and misleading\nstatements and/or concealed material adverse facts concerning Bumble’s relaunch strategy announced in 2024. The class action\ncomplaint seeks unspecified damages and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, as well as equitable\nrelief.\nOn October 31, 2024, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of\nTexas, naming as defendants certain of our current and former executives and directors, as well as the Company as a nominal\ndefendant. The complaint asserts state and federal claims based on the same alleged misstatements as the securities class action\ncomplaint. The complaints seek unspecified damages, attorneys’ fees, and other costs.\nThe Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in the lawsuits. However, any litigation is inherently uncertain,\nand any judgment or injunctive relief entered against the Company, or any adverse settlement, could materially and adversely impact\nthe business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company.\nOther Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to patent litigations asserted by non-practicing entities.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that provisions of $39.7 million and $65.8 million,\nrespectively, reflect our best estimate of any probable future obligation for the Company’s litigations. During the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid $0.7 million and $26.4 million, respectively, to settle litigation matters, which\namount is accordingly no longer reflected in the provision as of September 30, 2024. Legal expenses are included in “General and\nadministrative expense” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n29\nPurchase Commitments\nIn May 2023, the Company amended an agreement with one of our third parties related to cloud services, which superseded and\nreplaced the September 2022 agreement. Under the amended terms, the Company is committed to pay a minimum of $12.0 million\nover the period of 18 months from May 2023. If at the end of the 18 months, or upon early termination, the Company has not reached\nthe $12.0 million in spend, the Company will be required to pay for the difference between the sum of fees already incurred and the\nminimum commitment.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Bumble Inc. in\nconjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in Part I, “Item 1 –\nFinancial Statements (Unaudited).” This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties about\nour business and operations. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, without limitation, those discussed in this Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and those identified under “Special Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” herein and Part I, “Item 1A—Risk Factors\" in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe provide online dating and social networking applications through free, subscription and in-app purchases of products servicing\nNorth America, Europe and various other countries around the world. As of September 30, 2024, Bumble operates five apps, Bumble,\nBumble For Friends, Badoo, Fruitz, and Official. Bumble app, launched in 2014, is one of the first dating apps built with women at the\ncenter, where women make the first move. Bumble app is a leader in the online dating sector across several countries, including the\nUnited States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada. Badoo app, launched in 2006, was one of the pioneers of web and mobile\nfree-to-use dating products. Badoo app’s focus is to make finding meaningful connections easy, fun and accessible for a mainstream\nglobal audience. Badoo app continues to be a market leader in Europe and Latin America. In January 2022, we acquired Fruitz, an\nintentions-driven dating app focused on Gen Z, operating in EMEA and Canada. In April 2023, we acquired Official, an app that is\nintended to help couples build healthy and lasting habits in their romantic relationships. Building on the BFF mode in Bumble app, in\nJuly 2023 we officially launched a standalone Bumble For Friends app. Bumble For Friends app is a friendship app where people in\nall stages of life can meet people nearby and create meaningful platonic connections. Through the acquisition of Geneva in July 2024,\nwe aim to expand the Bumble For Friends experience from one-to-one connections to groups and communities to serve the many ways\npeople seek friendships.\nQuarter ended September 30, 2024 Consolidated Results\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated:\n• Total revenue of $273.6 million and $275.5 million, respectively;\n• Bumble App Revenue of $220.2 million and $221.8 million, respectively;\n• Badoo App and Other Revenue of $53.4 million and $53.7 million, respectively;\n• Net loss of $849.3 million, which includes an $892.2 million impairment loss, compared to net earnings of $23.1 million,\nrepresenting net earnings margin of 8.4%; and\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $82.6 million and $75.3 million, respectively, representing Adjusted EBITDA margins of 30.2%,\nand 27.3%, respectively.\nYear-to-Date ended September 30, 2024 Consolidated Results\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated:\n• Total revenue of $810.0 million and $778.2 million, respectively;\n• Bumble App Revenue of $653.9 million and $624.0 million, respectively;\n• Badoo App and Other Revenue of $156.1 million and $154.2 million, respectively;\n• Net loss of $777.7 million, which includes an $892.2 million impairment loss, compared to net earnings of $30.1 million,\nrepresenting net earnings margin of 3.9%; and\n• Adjusted EBITDA of $231.6 million and $201.9 million, respectively, representing Adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.6%\nand 25.9%, respectively.\n• Net cash provided by operating activities of $128.8 million and $118.7 million, respectively, and operating cash flow\nconversion of * and 393.7%, respectively; and\n• Free cash flow of $122.7 million and $105.9 million, respectively, representing free cash flow conversion of 53.0% and\n52.5%, respectively.\n* Not meaningful\n31\nFor a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion, which are all\nnon-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, information about why we consider Adjusted\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion useful and a discussion of the material risks and\nlimitations of these measures, please see “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nKey Operating and Financial Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key operating and financial metrics, to evaluate our business,\nmeasure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. We believe these\nnon-GAAP and operational measures are useful in evaluating our performance, in addition to our financial results prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures and a\nreconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nThe following metrics were calculated excluding paying users and revenue generated from Official, advertising and partnerships or\naffiliates and, for periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, excluding paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Beginning in\nthe fourth quarter of 2023, paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz are included in our key operating metrics. Prior period\ninformation and key operating metrics have not been recast to include paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz. Geneva is a\nnon-revenue generating app as of September 30, 2024 and excluded from our key operating metrics.\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except ARPPU) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBumble App Paying Users 2,869.3 2,604.9 2,805.5 2,460.5\nBadoo App and Other Paying Users 1,386.2 1,215.6 1,334.0 1,177.4\nTotal Paying Users 4,255.5 3,820.5 4,139.5 3,637.9\nBumble App Average Revenue per Paying User $ 25.58 $ 28.38 $ 25.90 $ 28.18\nBadoo App and Other Average Revenue per Paying User $ 12.03 $ 12.79 $ 12.10 $ 12.70\nTotal Average Revenue per Paying User $ 21.17 $ 23.42 $ 21.45 $ 23.17\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except per share data and percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\nRevenue $ 273,605 $ 275,510 $ 809,995 $ 778,193\nNet earnings (loss) (849,259) 23,124 (777,700) 30,144\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to Bumble Inc. shareholders (613,199) 16,671 (561,187) 21,813\nNet earnings (loss) per share attributable to Bumble Inc.\nshareholders\nBasic earnings (loss) per share $ (5.11) $ 0.12 $ (4.53) $ 0.16\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share $ (5.11) $ 0.12 $ (4.53) $ 0.16\nSeptember 30, December 31,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets Data:\nTotal assets $ 2,589,412 $ 3,625,127\nCash and cash equivalents 252,057 355,642\nLong-term debt, net including current maturities 617,981 620,926\nProfitability and Liquidity\nWe use net earnings (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to assess our profitability and liquidity, respectively.\nIn addition to net earnings (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, we also use the following measures:\n• Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest\n(income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, employer costs related\nto stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest\nrate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance\nreimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement\n32\n(benefit) expense, impairment loss, and costs associated with our Restructuring Plan. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n• Free cash flow. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures.\nFree cash flow conversion represents free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are key measures we use to assess our\nfinancial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted\nEBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties because\nthey can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. In\naddition, these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance.\nSee “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for additional information and a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA margin and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow.\nKey Factors Affecting our Performance\nOur results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including those\ndiscussed below.\nGrowth Strategy\nAs previously disclosed, we are in the process of implementing a new strategy and transformation plan intended to deliver durable\ncustomer value and drive long-term sustainable revenue. As part of this new strategy, we are focusing on fostering a vibrant and\nhealthy customer ecosystem, improving the customer experience through product innovation and optimization of operations, and\nevolving our revenue strategy to ensure we deliver value at every step of our customers’ journey through a rebalancing of Bumble app\nsubscription tiers, among other things. As we address these areas of focus, our user growth and success in attracting new users, user\nengagement and monetization may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if we do not successfully implement our new strategy, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSee also “If we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products or do\nnot convert to paying users, our revenue, financial results and business may be significantly harmed” and “We are subject to certain\nrisks as a mission-based company” in Part I, “Item 1A—Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Brands, Products and Operations” of our\n2023 Form 10-K.\nMacroeconomic Conditions\nMacroeconomic conditions, including the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, slower growth or economic recession,\nchanges to fiscal and monetary policy and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have impacted and may continue to impact\nour results of operations, as well as our consumers who face greater pressure on disposable income. We continuously monitor the\ndirect and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results.\nFor additional information, see “Risk Factors—General Risk Factors—We are exposed to changes in the global macroeconomic\nenvironment beyond our control, which may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, demand for our products and services,\nour expenses, and our ability to execute strategic plans.” in Part I, “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of our 2023 Form 10-K.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations\nAs a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable from period to period or going forward.\nSet forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn May 2024, our Board of Directors approved amendments to the share repurchase program to increase the authorized Class A\ncommon stock repurchase amount from $300.0 million to $450.0 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we\nrepurchased 14.2 million shares of Class A common stock for $89.7 million, excluding excise tax obligations. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 19.5 million shares of Class A common stock and 2.0 million Common Units for $174.1\nmillion, excluding excise tax obligations. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During\n33\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for $20.9 million. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, a total of $119.0 million remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program.\nFor additional information, see Note 2, Summary of Selected Significant Accounting Policies —Share Repurchase Program, Note 12,\nRelated Party Transactions — Share Repurchase, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I,\n“Item 1 – Financial Statements (Unaudited)” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with certain reorganization transactions and our IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of our pre-\nIPO owners that provides for the payment by the Company to such pre-IPO owners of 85% of the benefits that the Company realizes,\nor is deemed to realize, as a result of the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in our IPO and other tax benefits\nrelated to entering into the tax receivable agreement. The payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable\nagreement to the pre-IPO owners may be significant and are dependent upon future taxable income. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, our tax receivable agreement liability decreased by a net $17.2 million due to the following: (1) a $23.1 million\ndecrease from tax receivable agreement payments made during the first quarter of 2024, and (2) a partially offsetting net increase of\n$5.9 million, primarily due to the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Blackstone entities completed\nin the first quarter of 2024 and the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Bumble during 2024, the\nproceeds from which were used to fund Class A common stock repurchases during 2024.\nFor additional information, see “Risk Factors—Bumble Inc. will be required to pay certain of our pre-IPO owners for most of the\nbenefits relating to tax depreciation or amortization deductions that we may claim as a result of Bumble Inc.’s allocable share of\nexisting tax basis acquired in the IPO, Bumble Inc.’s increase in its allocable share of existing tax basis and anticipated tax basis\nadjustments we receive in connection with sales or exchanges of Common Units (including Common Units issued upon conversion of\nvested Incentive Units) in connection with or after the IPO and our utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies”,\n“Risk Factors—In certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the\nactual benefits Bumble Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.” in each case, in Part I,\n“Item 1A—Risk Factors” of our 2023 Form 10-K, and Note 4, Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement, to\nour unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, “Item 1 – Financial Statements (Unaudited)” of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nImpairment Charges\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we identified potential impairment triggering events related to our indefinite-lived\nassets, long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill. These triggering events included our revised 2024 outlook\nand a decrease in our stock price and market capitalization that was sustained during the third quarter of 2024. As a result, we\nperformed an interim impairment test. Based on the results of the test, we recognized impairment charges of $670.3 million for\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, $24.7 million for the Fruitz asset group and $197.2 million for goodwill during the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024. There were no impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2023.\nGiven the aforementioned impairment recorded in 2024, it is reasonably possible that changes in judgments, assumptions and\nestimates we made in assessing the fair values of these assets could cause us to consider some portion, or all of the remaining carrying\nvalues of these assets, to become impaired. A further decline in our stock price, economic downturns, a decline in market conditions\nand/or unfavorable industry trends could potentially trigger impairment tests in the future. In addition, reduced demand for our\nproducts, slower growth rates in our industry, and changes in market-based interest rates could negatively impact the estimated future\ncash flows and discount rates used in the income approach to determine the fair values of these assets and could result in an\nimpairment charge in the future.\nFor additional information, see Note 2, Summary of Selected Significant Accounting Policies—Impairment of Goodwill,—Impairment\nof Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets and —Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Definite-lived Intangible Assets and Note 5, Goodwill\nand Intangible Assets, Net to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, “Item 1 – Financial\nStatements (Unaudited)” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n34\nAcquisition\nOn July 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Geneva Technologies Inc.(“Geneva”) for total cash consideration of $17.5 million,\nnet of cash acquired, of which $17.2 million was allocated to developed technology and $0.3 million was allocated to other assets and\nliabilities.\nFor additional information, see Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in Part I, “Item 1 – Financial Statements (Unaudited)” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nRestructuring Plan\nOn February 27, 2024, the Company announced that it adopted a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) to reduce its global\nworkforce by approximately 350 roles to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities and to drive stronger operating\nleverage. The Restructuring Plan was completed in the third quarter of 2024, and we incurred approximately $20.4 million of total\nnon-recurring charges through the third quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of employee severance, benefits, and related charges for\nimpacted employees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred non-recurring charges of $0.6 million and\n$20.4 million, respectively.\nFor additional information, see Note 6, Restructuring Charges, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included\nin Part I, “Item 1 – Financial Statements (Unaudited)” of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nOur business is organized into a single reportable segment.\nRevenue\nWe monetize the Bumble, Bumble For Friends, Badoo, Fruitz and Official apps via a freemium model where the use of our service is\nfree and a subset of our users pay for subscriptions or in-app purchases to access premium features. Subscription revenue is presented\nnet of taxes, refunds and credit card chargebacks. This revenue is initially deferred and is recognized using the straight-line method\nover the term of the applicable subscription period.

Income tax provision was $16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $7.2 million\nfor the same period in 2023. The income tax provision is higher year over year for the three and nine months ended September 30,\n2024 primarily due to the impact of Pillar Two minimum taxes applicable in 2024 and due to an increase in the unfavorable tax effects\nassociated with the vesting and cancellation of certain stock-based awards in 2024.\nPillar Two Minimum Tax\nOn December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released the Pillar Two model rules providing a\nframework for implementing a 15% minimum tax, also referred to as the Global Anti-Base Erosion (\"GloBE\") rules, on earnings of\nmultinational companies with consolidated annual revenue exceeding €750 million. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in certain\njurisdictions where the Company operates, including the UK and certain EU member states, and is effective for the Company's\nfinancial year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company has performed an assessment of its exposure to Pillar Two income taxes,\nincluding its ability to qualify for transitional safe harbor relief under the GloBE rules. While the Company expects to qualify for\ntransitional safe harbor relief in most jurisdictions in which it operates, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the\ntransitional safe harbor is not available, including for certain entities classified as “stateless” constituent entities under the Pillar Two\nmodel rules. The Company’s income tax provision for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the\neffects of Pillar Two minimum taxes based on currently enacted legislation and guidance. The Company will continue to closely\nmonitor Pillar Two developments, including the release of additional administrative guidance on the application of the GloBE rules,\nand evaluate the potential impact to the Company’s financial position.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe report our financial results in accordance with GAAP, however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance\nacross periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the\nimpact of certain expenses, including income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization\nexpense, stock-based compensation expenses, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss,\nchanges in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other\ncosts, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement\nliability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and costs associated with our Restructuring Plan, as management does not\nbelieve these expenses are representative of our core earnings. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated as\nAdjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we believe free cash flow and\nfree cash flow conversion provide useful information regarding how cash provided by (used in) operating activities compares to the\ncapital expenditures required to maintain and grow our business, and our available liquidity, after funding such capital expenditures, to\nservice our debt, fund strategic initiatives, effectuate discretionary share repurchases and strengthen our balance sheet, as well as our\nability to convert our earnings to cash. Additionally, we believe such metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysis, ratings\nagencies and other parties in evaluating liquidity and debt-service capabilities. We calculate free cash flow and free cash flow\nconversion using methodologies that we believe can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand\nunderlying trends in our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, have limitations as\nanalytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under\nGAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are:\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and\namortization of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets and, although these are non-cash expenses, the\nassets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital\nneeds;\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude stock-based compensation expense and employer costs related\nto stock-based compensation, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, an important part of how\nwe attract and retain our employees and a significant recurring expense in our business;\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the interest (income) expense, net or the cash\nrequirements to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness, and free cash flow does not reflect the cash\nrequirements to service principal payments on our indebtedness;\n41\n• Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect income tax (benefit) provision we are required to make;\nand\n• Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion do not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes\nand does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a liquidity measure and should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the\ngrowth of our business or to distribute to stockholders or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.\nTo properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage investors to review the financial statements included elsewhere in this\nreport, and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business. We also strongly urge investors to review the reconciliation\nof net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, the computation of Adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to net earnings (loss) margin\nwhich is net earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenue, the reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free\ncash flow, and the computation of free cash flow conversion as compared to operating cash flow conversion, which is net cash\nprovided by (used in) operating activities as a percentage of net earnings (loss) in each case set forth below.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net,\ndepreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, employer costs related to stock-based compensation,\nforeign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity\nsecurities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of\nbusiness, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and restructuring costs. Adjusted\nEBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.\n42\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion\nrepresents free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. Operating cash flow conversion represents net cash provided by (used\nin) operating activities as a percentage of net earnings (loss).\nThe following table reconciles our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures for the periods\npresented:\nThree Months Three Months Nine Months Nine Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet earnings (loss) $ (849,259) $ 23,124 $ (777,700) $ 30,144\nAdd back:\nIncome tax provision 4,161 1,872 16,263 7,228\nInterest expense, net 9,809 5,256 27,809 16,585\nDepreciation and amortization expense 18,312 17,127 52,542 50,825\nStock-based compensation expense 10,158 21,528 12,273 83,660\nEmployer costs related to stock-based compensation (1) 441 1,003 2,390 4,025\nLitigation costs, net of insurance reimbursements (2) 959 16,323 9,695 24,874\nForeign exchange gain (3) (12,143) (3,905) (11,515) (2,439)\nChanges in fair value of interest rate swaps (4) 8,687 3,796 6,995 9,029\nRestructuring costs (5) 582 — 20,355 —\nTransaction and other costs (6) 583 463 1,297 1,994\nChanges in fair value of contingent earn-out liability (2,689) (11,308) (22,032) (24,241)\nChanges in fair value of investments in equity securities (20) 2 26 178\nTax receivable agreement liability remeasurement expense (7) 721 — 951 —\nImpairment loss (8) 892,248 — 892,248 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 82,550 $ 75,281 $ 231,597 $ 201,862\nNet earnings (loss) margin (310.4)% 8.4% (96.0)% 3.9%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 30.2% 27.3% 28.6% 25.9%\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 128,839 $ 118,669\nLess:\nCapital expenditures (6,150) (12,769)\nFree cash flow $ 122,689 $ 105,900\nOperating cash flow conversion * 393.7%\nFree cash flow conversion 53.0% 52.5%\n* Not meaningful\n(1) Represents employer portion of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes domestically, National Insurance contributions\nin the United Kingdom and comparable costs internationally related to the settlement of equity awards.\n(2) Represents certain litigation costs, net of insurance proceeds, associated with pending litigations or settlements of\nlitigation that arise outside of the ordinary course of business.\n(3) Represents foreign exchange gain due to foreign currency transactions.\n(4) Represents fair value loss on interest rate swaps.\n(5) Represents costs associated with the Restructuring Plan, such as severance, benefits and other related costs.\n(6) Represents transaction costs related to acquisitions and secondary offerings such as legal, accounting, advisory fees and\nother related costs.\n(7) Represents recognized adjustments to the tax receivable agreement liability.\n(8) Represents impairment charges to indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Fruitz asset group and goodwill in 2024.\n43\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $252.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $103.6 million from December 31, 2023\nprimarily due to share repurchases and the acquisition of Geneva, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our principal\nsources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating\nexpenses and capital expenditures, acquisition of businesses, funding of our debt obligations, partnership tax distributions, paying\nincome taxes and obligations under our tax receivable agreement and effectuating share repurchases as discussed below. Based on\ncurrent conditions, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our activities and execute our business plans during\nthe next twelve months.\nIn May 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to $150.0 million of our\noutstanding Class A common stock with repurchases under the program to be made on a discretionary basis from time to time, subject\nto general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or other means,\nincluding privately negotiated transactions. We announced increases in the share repurchase program authorized amount from $150.0\nmillion to $300.0 million in November 2023 and from $300.0 million to $450.0 million in May 2024. This repurchase program may be\ncommenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 14.2 million\nshares of Class A common stock for $89.7 million, excluding excise tax obligations. During the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, we repurchased 19.5 million shares of Class A common stock and 2.0 million Common Units for $174.1 million, excluding\nexcise tax obligations. In addition, in October 2024, we repurchased an additional 4.4 million shares of Class A common stock\npursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the amount of $30.0 million,\nexcluding excise tax obligations. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for $20.9 million. As of October 31,\n2024, a total of $89.0 million remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program, subject to an approximately 3.1 million\nshare repurchase limit which may be increased pursuant to authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors.\nOn February 27, 2024, we announced that the Company adopted the Restructuring Plan to reduce its global workforce. The\nRestructuring Plan was completed in the third quarter of 2024, and we incurred approximately $20.4 million of total non-recurring\ncharges through the third quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made $19.1 million of cash\npayments in connection with the Restructuring Plan.\nIn July 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Geneva for a total cash consideration of $17.5 million, net of cash acquired.\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes our unaudited condensed consolidated cash flow information for the periods presented:\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 128,839 $ 118,669\nInvesting activities (23,585) (22,589)\nFinancing activities (207,749) (58,355)\nOperating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $128.8 million and $118.7 million, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30,\n2024 and 2023.

During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, the Company used $20.9 million for share repurchases of our Class A common stock. During the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used $9.6 million and $13.9 million, respectively, for shares withheld to satisfy\nemployee tax withholding requirements upon vesting of restricted stock units and made cash distribution payments of $7.9 million and\n$19.3 million, respectively, to the noncontrolling interest holders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in\nfinancing activities included $11.9 million of tax receivable agreement payments. The Company used $4.3 million in both of the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Original Term Loan.\nIndebtedness\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nIn connection with the Sponsor Acquisition, in January 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) providing\nfor (i) a term loan facility in an original aggregate principal amount of $575.0 million (the “Original Term Loan Facility”) and (ii) a\nrevolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $50.0 million. In connection with a transaction whereby we distributed\nproceeds to our pre-IPO owners and to partially repay a loan from our Founder, in October 2020, we entered into the Incremental\nTerm Loan Facility (the “Incremental Term Loan Facility” and together with the Original Term Loan Facility, the “Senior Secured\nCredit Facilities”) in an original aggregate principal amount of $275.0 million. The Incremental Term Loan provides for additional\nsenior secured term loans with substantially identical terms as the Original Term Loan Facility (other than the applicable margin). A\nportion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering was used to repay $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our\noutstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement was further\namended in March 2023, pursuant to which the interest rate benchmark referenced to LIBOR was transitioned to SOFR. The borrower\nunder the Credit Agreement is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bumble Holdings, Buzz Finco L.L.C. (the “Borrower”). The Credit\nAgreement contains affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrower’s option, either (i) LIBOR prior to March 31,\n2023 and Adjusted Term SOFR beginning March 31, 2023 for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements\n(subject to a floor of 0.0% on the Original Term Loan and 0.50% on the Incremental Term Loan), plus an applicable margin or (ii) a\nbase rate equal to the highest of (a) the rate of interest in effect as last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the “Prime Rate” in the\nUnited States, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (c) adjusted LIBOR prior to April 1, 2023 and Adjusted Term SOFR\nbeginning April 1, 2023, for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% (subject to a floor of 0.00% per annum), in each case, plus an\napplicable margin. The applicable margin for loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to adjustment based upon the\nconsolidated first lien net leverage ratio of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and is subject to reduction after the\nconsummation of our initial public offering.\nIn addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower is required to pay a commitment\nfee of 0.50% per annum (which is subject to a decrease to 0.375% per annum based upon the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio\nof the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries) to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized\ncommitments thereunder. The Borrower must also pay customary letter of credit fees and an annual administrative agency fee.\nThe Original Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the principal\namount of the Original Term Loan Facility outstanding as of the date of the closing of the Original Term Loan Facility, with the\nbalance being payable at maturity on January 29, 2027. The Incremental Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments\nin aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00% of the principal amount of the Incremental Term Loan Facility outstanding as of the date\nof the closing of the Incremental Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable at maturity on January 29, 2027. Following the\n$200.0 million aggregate principal payment of outstanding indebtedness during the three months ended March 31, 2021, quarterly\ninstallment payments on the Incremental Term Loan Facility are no longer required for the remaining term of the facility. Principal\namounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full at maturity on January 29,\n45\n2025.\nContractual Obligations and Contingencies\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024:\nPayments due\n(In thousands) Total Less than 1 year More than 1 year\nLong-term debt, including interest $ 622,750 $ 5,750 $ 617,000\nOperating lease liabilities, including imputed interest 15,427 3,133 12,294\nOther (1) 11,432 9,316 2,116\nTotal $ 649,609 $ 18,199 $ 631,410\n(1) We have contractual obligations with various third parties. In May 2023, we amended an agreement with one of our third parties\nrelated to cloud services, which superseded and replaced the September 2022 agreement. Under the amended terms, we are committed\nto pay a minimum of $12.0 million over the period of 18 months from May 2023. If at the end of the 18 months, or upon early\ntermination, we have not reached the $12.0 million in spend, we will be required to pay for the difference between the sum of fees\nalready incurred and the minimum commitment. As of September 30, 2024, our minimum commitment remaining with this third party\nis $2.6 million.\nAdditionally, we have the following contractual obligations not reflected in the table set forth above:\nIn connection with the IPO, in February 2021, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of our pre-IPO owners that\nprovides for the payment by the Company to such pre-IPO owners of 85% of the benefits that the Company realizes, or is deemed to\nrealize, as a result of the Company’s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in our IPO and other tax benefits related to entering\ninto the tax receivable agreement. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of\nthe Company by the pre-IPO owners. The payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreement to the pre-\nIPO owners may be significant and are not reflected in the contractual obligations table set forth above as they are dependent upon\nfuture taxable income. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all\ntax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement, we expect future payments under the tax receivable agreement related to\nthe Offering Transactions and subsequent activity through September 30, 2024 to aggregate to $703.4 million and to range over the\nnext 15 years from approximately $5.6 million to $77.2 million per year and decline thereafter. In determining these estimated future\npayments, we have given retrospective effect to certain exchanges of Common Units for Class A shares that occurred after the IPO but\nwere contemplated to have occurred pursuant to the Blocker Restructuring. The foregoing numbers are merely estimates, and the\nactual payments could differ materially. See Note 4, Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement, for\nadditional information.\nIn connection with the Sponsor Acquisition in January 2020, we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement, consisting of an\nearn-out payment to the former shareholders of Worldwide Vision Limited of up to $150.0 million. The timing and amount of such\npayments, that we may be required to make, is not reflected in the contractual obligations table set forth above as the payment to the\nformer shareholders of Worldwide Vision Limited is dependent upon the achievement of a specified return on invested capital by our\nSponsor. See Note 11, Fair Value Measurements, in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have discussed the estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment in their\napplication and are based on information that is inherently uncertain in our 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThere have been no significant changes to these accounting policies and estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nRelated Party Transactions\nFor discussions of related party transactions, see Note 12, Related Party Transactions, to the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements included in “Item 1 - Financial Statements (Unaudited).”\n46\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the United Kingdom and the European Union. For the three months\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue outside of the United States accounted for 52.9% and 47.9% of consolidated revenue,\nrespectively. Revenue outside of the United States accounted for 51.4% and 46.8% of combined revenue for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is the underlying user’s\nfunctional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the British Pound and Euro. As foreign currency exchange rates change,\ntranslation of the statements of operations of our international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of\noperating results. The average Euro versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 0.9% and 0.3% higher in the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The average British Pound\nversus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 2.7% and 2.6% higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\nHistorically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of September 30, 2024\nand 2023. A hypothetical 10% change in British Pound and Euro, relative to the U.S. Dollar, would have changed revenue by $19.1\nmillion and $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with all other variables held constant.\nThis accounts for 2.4% and 0.8% of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our\ncontinued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a\nsignificant impact on our future results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nAt September 30, 2024, we had debt outstanding with a carrying value of $618.0 million. With consideration of the financial impact of\nour interest rate swaps, a hypothetical interest rate increase of 1% would have increased interest expense for the three and nine months\nended September 30, 2024 by $0.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively, based upon the outstanding debt balances and interest rates\nin effect during that period.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable market rate. In order to reduce the financial impact of\nincreases in interest rates, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $350.0 million on June 22,\n2020, which were set to expire on June 30, 2024. In January 2024, we replaced these interest rate swaps and entered into new interest\nrate swaps for the same notional value of $350.0 million to extend the expiration from June 2024 to January 2027. The financial\nimpact of the interest rate swaps is to fix the variable interest rate element on $350.0 million of the long-term debt at a rate of 3.18%.\nSee Note 9, Debt, within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation,\nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit\nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of\nthe SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and\nChief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed its implementation of a new enterprise resource planning\n(“ERP”) system. The new ERP system integrates various financial and operational processes to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and\ninternal controls.\nA standardized internal control framework was used during implementation and monitoring controls have been established.\nManagement will continue to assess and monitor the new ERP system to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of internal controls.\nOther than the ERP system implementation, there have been no material changes in the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany's internal control over financial reporting.\n47\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nIn May 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a share repurchase program of up to $150.0 million of our\noutstanding Class A common stock with repurchases under the program to be made on a discretionary basis from time to time, subject\nto general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or other means,\nincluding privately negotiated transactions. The Company announced increases in the share repurchase program authorized amount\nfrom $150.0 million to $300.0 million in November 2023 and from $300.0 million to $450.0 million in May 2024. As of September\n30, 2024, a total of $119.0 million remained available for repurchase under the program.\nThe following table sets forth purchases by the Company of its Class A common stock during the three months ended September 30,\n2024 under this publicly announced share repurchase program.\n(d)\nMaximum\n(c) Approximate Dollar\n(a) Total Number of Value of Shares That\nTotal Shares Purchased as May Yet Be Purchased\nNumber of (b) Part of Publicly Under Publicly\nShares Average Price Announced Plans or Announced Plans or\nPeriod Purchased Paid Per Share(1) Programs Programs(2)\nJuly 1 - July 31, 2024 — $ — — $ 208,717,169\nAugust 1 - August 31,\n2024 13,571,145 6.31 13,571,145 123,053,131\nSeptember 1 - September\n30, 2024 599,499 6.70 599,499 119,035,903\nTotal 14,170,644 $ 6.33 14,170,644 $ 119,035,903\nIn October 2024, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $30.0 million, excluding excise tax obligations, pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1\ntrading plan.\n(1) Average price paid per share includes costs associated with the repurchases (i.e. broker commissions, etc.) but excludes the 1%\nexcise tax accrued on our share repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n(2) Represents the approximate dollar value of shares of Class A common stock that remained available for repurchase as of the end of\neach monthly period reflected in the applicable row.
