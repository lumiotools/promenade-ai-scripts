Stockholders and prospective investors can also register to automatically receive the Company’s press releases, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and other notices by e-mail.\n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nThis press release and the accompanying financial statement tables reference non-GAAP financial measures, such as gross profit margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Such non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information and should not be considered substitutes for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures are provided for consistency and comparability to prior year results; furthermore, management believes such non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors when evaluating the Company’s performance, as such non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s future operating performance. Pro forma measures, if applicable, are adjusted to include the results of our acquisitions, and exclude the results of divestments, as if the transactions occurred in the beginning of the periods mentioned. Such non-GAAP financial measures may differ materially from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure and a more detailed discussion of each financial measure; as such, the financial statement tables should be read in conjunction with the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nIn addition, forward-looking adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS for fiscal 2024 exclude potential charges or gains that may be recorded during the fiscal year, including among other things, the potential impact of any future divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, or other business combinations, changes in debt structure, or future significant share repurchases. We have not attempted to provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP earnings guidance to the comparable GAAP measure, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because the impact and timing of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the Company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of our financial performance.\n\n**FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**\n\n _In addition to historical information, this press release contains statements relating to our future results (including certain projections and business trends) that are_ “ _forward-looking statements_ ” _within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the_ “ _Exchange Act_ ” _), and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to the_ “ _safe harbor_ ” _created by those sections.

EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration-related (benefits) costs, restructuring (benefits) costs, legal and other losses, customer bankruptcy loss, impairment charges, gain or loss on derivative, loss on early extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on disposal of fixed assets, gain or loss on lease termination, gain or loss on sale of business, other expense (income), net, equity compensation, and system conversion costs. Adjusted EBITDA is not and should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders as an indicator of operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and as one performance measure in its incentive programs for certain members of its management team. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined, closely matches the operating measure as defined by the Company's credit facilities. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by the Company's consolidated revenue.  \n---|---  \n(b)| The decrease in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a decrease in book income primarily driven by credit loss expense.  \n(c)| Restructuring costs were primarily comprised of employee termination costs, lease-related exit costs, and reorganization costs as part of planned cost savings initiatives.  \n(d)| Includes legal costs and other settlement charges as presented on the consolidated statements of operations, losses pertaining to matters outside the normal course of operations, and $19.4 million of credit loss expense driven by a bankruptcy filing by a single large customer for the nine months ending September 30, 2024. There was no significant impact on operations from this client as the majority of the business had been wound down in the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company incurred $1.1 million, including legal fees, to settle a wage and hour class action lawsuit.  \n(e)| Impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were related to right-of-use assets and related property in connection with vacated leases during 2024. Impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the write-off of an abandoned IT project.  \n(f)| Loss on early extinguishment of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of the write-off of debt issuance costs related to the payoff and termination of the term loan on June 30, 3023.  \n(g)| System conversion costs include enterprise resource planning system costs related to the upgrading and integrating of our middle and back-office platforms, with certain development costs capitalized and amortized in accordance with the Company’s policies, and applicant tracking system costs related to the Company’s project to replace its legacy system supporting its travel nurse staffing business.  \n(h)| Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders per diluted share before the diluted EPS impact of acquisition and integration-related (benefits) costs, restructuring (benefits) costs, legal and other losses, customer bankruptcy loss, impairment charges, gain or loss on derivative, loss on early extinguishment of debt, gain or loss on sale of business, system conversion costs, and nonrecurring income tax adjustments. Adjusted EPS is not and should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Management presents Adjusted EPS because it believes that Adjusted EPS is a useful supplement to its reported EPS as an indicator of operating performance. Management believes Adjusted EPS provides a more useful comparison of the Company’s underlying business performance from period to period and is more representative of the future earnings capacity of the Company than EPS. Quarterly non-GAAP adjustment may vary due to rounding.  \n(i)| Financial information included in the December 31, 2023 balance sheet includes immaterial revisions to the Company's previously-reported financial information. Please see the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC, for more information.  \n(j)| Segment data is provided in accordance with the Segment Reporting Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification.  \n(k)| Contribution income is defined as income (loss) from operations before depreciation and amortization, acquisition and integration-related (benefits) costs, restructuring (benefits) costs, legal and other losses, impairment charges, and corporate overhead. Contribution income is a financial measure used by management when assessing segment performance.  \n(l)| Corporate overhead includes unallocated executive leadership and other centralized corporate functional support costs such as finance, IT, legal, human resources, and marketing, as well as public company expenses and Company-wide projects (initiatives).  \n(m)| Legal and other losses includes legal costs and other settlement charges as presented on the consolidated statements of operations and losses pertaining to matters outside the normal course of operations.  \n(n)| Gross profit is defined as revenue from services less direct operating expenses. The Company’s gross profit excludes allocated depreciation and amortization expense. Gross profit margin is calculated by dividing gross profit by revenue from services.  \n(o)| FTEs represent the average number of Nurse and Allied Staffing contract personnel on a full-time equivalent basis.  \n(p)| Average revenue per FTE per day is calculated by dividing Nurse and Allied Staffing revenue, excluding permanent placement, per FTE by the number of days worked in the respective periods.  \n(q)| Days filled is calculated by dividing the total hours invoiced during the period, including an estimate for the impact of accrued revenue, by 8 hours.  \n(r)| Revenue per day filled is calculated by dividing revenue as reported by days filled for the period presented.  \n  \n![](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=bwnews&sty=20241105337918r1&sid=acqr8&distro=nx&lang=en)\n\nView source version on [businesswire.com](http://businesswire.com): [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241105337918/en/](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241105337918/en/)\n\nCross Country Healthcare, Inc.
