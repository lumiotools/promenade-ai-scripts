(Nasdaq: HOLX) will reveal new technologies reimagining the future of breast health at the 110 th Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) in Chicago on December 1-5. On the show floor and during multiple workshops, Hologic will showcase AI-powered breast imaging advancements designed to assess breast density, enhance workflows and improve cancer detection. \n\n![Experience the cutting-edge Envision™ Mammography Platform \\(Graphic: Business Wire\\)](https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20241125586668/en/2314422/4/11.7_RSNA.jpg)\n\nExperience the cutting-edge Envision™ Mammography Platform (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nFor the first time, attendees can experience the cutting-edge Envision™ Mammography Platform, which offers patients a high-speed Hologic 3D™ mammogram with an industry-leading 2.5-second scan time. 1*  This next-generation technology provides a more comfortable exam with tilt positioning, adapting to patients rather than the other way around. 2 As the first FDA-approved mammography technology of its kind, 3 the Envision platform enhances the detection of subtle objects, minimizes focal spot blur and improves 3D image sharpness. 4,5,6*\n\n“There is tremendous excitement surrounding our latest breast health innovations, and our team is looking forward to showcasing the many ways we’re advancing solutions across the breast health continuum at this year’s RSNA,” said Erik Anderson, President of Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions at Hologic. “Through strong customer relationships, continuous improvement and the latest research, we continue to take our leading technologies to the next level to support healthcare providers in improving the patient experience and providing excellent care.” \n\nFurther demonstrating its leadership in breast imaging AI, Hologic will also introduce its next-generation Genius AI ® Detection PRO solution for use in the United States. This advanced cancer screening technology expands on Hologic’s Genius AI Detection 2.0 solution by providing even greater accuracy and efficiency, 7  giving radiologists more confidence and helping to reduce false positives. 8 This new mammography AI assistant provides: \n\n  * A **deep-learning** **2D and 3D algorithm** that improves specificity by using a patient’s **prior exam** in the current exam’s analysis. \n  * Intuitive **1** - **10 case and lesion scoring** and **pre-populated exam reports** designed to accelerate image review and save radiologists’ valuable time. \n  * An all-in-one interface that conveniently includes **deep-learning breast density** **scoring** along with key **patient and mammogram quality** information, designed to support radiologists at every step of the reading workflow. \n\n\n\n“With Genius AI Detection PRO, Hologic continues to lead the way in innovation for AI in breast imaging and cancer detection,” said Anderson. “By harnessing the latest advances in artificial intelligence and transformative workflow features, we continue to push the boundaries of science to revolutionize mammography and the future of women’s healthcare.” \n\nOn December 1 at RSNA, Hologic will also present the results of a recently published study demonstrating the performance of its Genius AI Detection 2.0 software across diverse patient populations. The study looked at more than 7,500 3D mammograms from women who identified as Asian, Black, Hispanic or white. Researchers found that the measured performance of the algorithm was similar across all cohorts evaluated, 8 illustrating its ability to deliver results that are not impacted by racial bias. Reducing racial bias in AI algorithms is a growing concern in healthcare. \n\nIn the South Hall, Booth #1919 at McCormick Place, attendees can experience Hologic’s Dimensions ® mammography portfolio, Envision Mammography Platform, Genius AI Detection 2.0 and Genius AI Detection PRO software, Affirm ® Contrast Biopsy software, I-View ® Contrast Enhanced Mammography software and a full suite of breast biopsy and surgery solutions. The company will also showcase recently acquired Endomag wireless breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing solutions, including the Magseed ® marker, the Magtrace ® lymphatic tracer and the Sentimag ® platform. \n\nAdditionally, Hologic will host several workshops including: \n\n  * **Navigating Breast Localization: From Imaging to Surgery** _Sunday, Dec. 1: 11:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. CST (Room S502)_ A panel discussion aiming to foster collaboration between radiologists and surgeons and discuss the latest advancements and best practices in breast localization to improve patient care and outcomes. \n\n\n  * **Enhancing Breast Cancer Detection: The Role of AI in Mammography** _Tuesday, Dec. 3: 12-1 p.m. CST (Room S502)_ This presentation will delve into the transformative impact of AI on breast cancer detection. Speakers will discuss how AI technologies, particularly machine learning and deep learning algorithms, are enhancing the accuracy, speed and reliability of breast cancer screening processes. \n\n\n  * **Innovative Advancements in Breast Cancer Screening: The Role of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography** _Wednesday, Dec. 4: 12-1 p.m. CST (Room S502)_ This presentation will explore contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) in breast cancer detection. Speakers will talk about how CEM enhances traditional mammography by providing more detailed and accurate imaging, leading to improved diagnostic outcomes. \n\n\n\nFinally, Hologic is proud to announce it was recently awarded the Excellence in Imaging Informatics Award by the American Board of Imaging Informatics (ABII), marking the first time an organization has been selected for this recognition. The award underscores the company’s commitment to providing not only the best early cancer detection technology, but also to serving as a valuable partner in imaging workflow and informatics integration. Hologic’s Certified Imaging Informatics Professionals (CIIPs) meet high standards of excellence set forth by the ABII, working with customers to design imaging workflow solutions to ensure the company’s technologies are easily integrated and maximized to provide better patient care. \n\nTo learn more about Hologic’s presence at RSNA 2024, please visit [Hologic.com/RSNA](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hologic.com%2Frsna&esheet=54157248&newsitemid=20241125586668&lan=en-US&anchor=Hologic.com%2FRSNA&index=1&md5=ef068e1f68f4ef21c17a5e90c438516d). \n\n**About Hologic, Inc.**\n\nHologic, Inc. is a global leader in women’s health dedicated to developing innovative medical technologies that effectively detect, diagnosis and treat health conditions and raise the standard of care around the world.

These statements constitute projections, forecasts and forward-looking statements, and are not guarantees of performance. Landsea Homes cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to numerous\nassumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Words such as “may,” “can,” “should,” “will,” “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “seek,” “target,” “look” or similar\nexpressions may identify forward-looking statements. Specifically, forward-looking statements may include statements relating to: the benefits of the Business Combination and the acquisition of Vintage Estate Homes (the\n“Acquisition”); the future financial performance of the Company; changes in the market for Landsea Homes’ products and services; and other expansion plans and opportunities.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this presentation and our management’s current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of judgments, risks and\nuncertainties that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nThese risks and uncertainties include, but not are limited to, the risk factors described by Landsea Homes in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These risk factors and those identified elsewhere in this\npress release, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance and include, but are not limited to: the ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination and the\nAcquisition, which may be affected by, among other things, competition, the ability to integrate the combined business and the acquired business, and the ability of the combined business and the acquired business to grow and\nmanage growth profitably; costs related to the Business Combination; the ability to maintain the listing of Landsea Homes’ securities on Nasdaq; the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company;\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations; the inability to launch new Landsea Homes products or services or to profitably expand into new markets; the possibility that Landsea Homes may be adversely affected by other economic,\nbusiness, and/or competitive factors; and other risks and uncertainties indicated in Landsea Homes’ SEC reports or documents filed or to be filed with the SEC by Landsea Homes.\nAccordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements in deciding whether to invest\nin our securities.

Any non-GAAP financial measures and other non-GAAP\nfinancial information used in this presentation are in addition to, and should not be considered superior to, or a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures and other non-\nGAAP financial information is subject to significant inherent limitations. The non-GAAP financial measures Landsea Homes uses in this presentation include net debt to net capital, adjusted home sales gross margin, adjusted net\nincome, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.\nWe believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures presents additional information which, when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, facilitates the\nanalysis of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or principles. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may\ndiffer from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies may use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial\nmeasures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information should only be used to evaluate our financial results in\nconjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP financial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented.

These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors additional insights to facilitate the analysis of our\nresults of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive or standard set of accounting rules or\nprinciples. Accordingly, the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of non-GAAP financial measures other companies\nmay use with the same or similar names. This limits, to some extent, the usefulness of this information for comparison purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures\nhave limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP. This information\nshould only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP information. Accordingly, we qualify our use of non-GAAP\nfinancial measures whenever non-GAAP financial measures are presented.\nNET DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL\n16\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nADJUSTED HOME SALES GROSS MARGIN\n(1) This non-GAAP financial measure should not be used as a substitute for the Company's operating results in accordance with GAAP. An analysis of any non-GAAP financial\nmeasure should be used in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP measure is meaningful because it provides insight into the\nimpact that financing arrangements and acquisitions have on our homebuilding gross margin and allows for comparability of our gross margins to competitors that present similar\ninformation.\n17\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nADJUSTED NET INCOME\n(1) Our tax-effected adjustments are based on our federal rate and a blended state rate adjusted for certain discrete items.\n18\nReconciliations Of Adjusted Metrics\nCONT’D (Non-GAAP)\nEBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\n19"

International revenue of $242.3 million increased 5.4%, or 4.3% in constant currency. \n  * GAAP gross margin of 56.5% increased 360 basis points primarily due to inventory write-offs related to a discontinued product line in the prior year period. Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.5% increased 110 basis points primarily due to an increase in sales compared to the prior year period. \n  * GAAP operating margin of 23.3% increased 930 basis points primarily due to the prior year period including a loss of $51.7 million to record the SSI ultrasound imaging business as assets held-for-sale. Non-GAAP operating margin of 30.0% increased 170 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue and improved operating leverage compared to the prior year period. \n  * GAAP net income of $178.6 million increased 97.1% and Non-GAAP net income of $237.5 million increased 8.3%. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) was $323.7 million, an increase of 12.3%. \n  * COVID-19 revenues, which consist of COVID-19 assay revenue of $15.2 million, and other COVID-19 related revenue plus revenue from discontinued products of $24.8 million, decreased (12.4%), or (12.5%) in constant currency. \n  * The Company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.16 billion, and an adjusted net leverage ratio (net debt over adjusted EBITDA) of 0.3 times. \n  * Adjusted Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) was 14.1%, a decrease of (30) basis points compared to the prior year period. \n\n\n\n** Financial Guidance for the First Quarter and Full-Year Fiscal 2025 **\n\n“In our fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Hologic delivered strong financial performance, capping off another solid year of growth,” said Karleen Oberton, Hologic’s chief financial officer. “Looking ahead to fiscal 2025, our robust balance sheet and projected strong cash flows provide exceptional operational flexibility, positioning us well to achieve sustainable revenue growth and even faster EPS growth over the long term.” \n\nHologic’s financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2025 is shown in the table below. The guidance is based on a full year non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of approximately 235 million for the full year. Constant currency guidance assumes that foreign exchange rates are the same in fiscal 2025 as in fiscal 2024. Organic revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 is in constant currency and excludes the divested Blood Screening and SSI ultrasound imaging businesses. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue guidance starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 is in constant currency and is organic revenue excluding COVID-19 assay revenue, COVID-19 related revenue, and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. \n\nThe guidance below includes the financial results of the closed Endomagnetics acquisition for the full year, which will become organic in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, but does not include any contribution from the Gynesonics acquisition, which has not closed. There is no year over year net selling day impact comparing 2025 to 2024. First quarter and full year fiscal 2025 guidance incorporates the expected impact from the ongoing temporary stop-ship of Horizon DXA systems (Skeletal). \n\nCurrent Guidance   \n---  \nGuidance $  |  Reported % Increase (Decrease)  |  Constant Currency % Increase (Decrease)  |  Organic % Increase (Decrease)  |  Organic excluding COVID-19 % Increase (Decrease)   \nFiscal 2025  \nRevenue  |  $4,150 - $4,200  |  3.0% to 4.2%  |  2.3% to 3.5%  |  1.7% to 3.0%  |  3.4% to 4.7%   \nGAAP EPS  |  $3.53 - $3.63  |  6.3% to 9.3%   \nNon-GAAP EPS  |  $4.25 - $4.35  |  4.2% to 6.6%   \nQ1 2025  \nRevenue  |  $1,025 - $1,035  |  1.2% to 2.2%  |  0.4% to 1.4%  |  (0.2%) to 0.8%  |  1.8% to 2.8%   \nGAAP EPS  |  $0.81 - $0.84  |  (21.4%) to (18.4%)   \nNon-GAAP EPS  |  $1.00 - $1.03  |  2.0% to 5.1%   \n  \n** Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures **\n\nThe Company has presented the following non-GAAP financial measures in this press release: constant currency revenues; organic revenues; organic revenues excluding COVID-19; non-GAAP gross margin; non-GAAP operating expenses; non-GAAP operating margin; non-GAAP effective tax rate; non-GAAP net income; non-GAAP net income margin; non-GAAP EPS; adjusted EBITDA; adjusted net leverage ratio and adjusted ROIC. Organic revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 excludes the divested Blood Screening and SSI ultrasound imaging businesses and the acquired Endomagnetics business. Revenue from acquired businesses is generally included in organic revenue starting a year after the acquisition. Organic revenue excluding COVID-19 revenues is organic revenue less COVID-19 assay revenue, COVID-19 related sales of instruments, collection kits and ancillaries, COVID-19 related revenue from Diagenode and Mobidiag, as well as COVID-19 related license revenue, and revenues from discontinued products in Diagnostics. The Company defines its non-GAAP net income, EPS, and other non-GAAP financial measures to exclude, as applicable: (i) the amortization of intangible assets; (ii) the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and equipment and the loss to record assets held-for-sale to fair value less costs to sell; (iii) adjustments to record contingent consideration at fair value; (iv) charges to write-off inventory for a product line discontinuance; (v) the fair value write-up of acquired inventory sold during the period (vi) restructuring charges, facility closure and consolidation charges (including accelerated depreciation), and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services); (vii) transaction related expenses for acquisitions and dispositions; (viii) third-party expenses incurred related to the implementation of the European MDR/IVDR requirements and obtaining the appropriate approvals for its existing products; (ix) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (x) unrealized (gains) losses on the mark-to-market of foreign currency contracts to hedge operating results for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (xi) litigation settlement charges (benefits) and non-income tax related charges (benefits); (xii) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xiii) the impacts related to internal restructurings and non-operational items; (xiv) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xv) income taxes related to such adjustments. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as its non-GAAP net income plus net interest income/expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense included in its non-GAAP net income. The Company defines its adjusted net leverage ratio as the principal amount of its debt net of cash and cash equivalents, divided by its adjusted EBITDA for the last four quarters. The Company defines its adjusted ROIC as its non-GAAP operating income for a trailing twelve months tax effected by its non-GAAP effective tax rate divided by the sum of its average net debt and stockholders’ equity, which is adjusted to exclude the after-tax effects of goodwill and intangible assets and equipment impairment charges. \n\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. \n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items many of which can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business. \n\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release. \n\n** Conference Call and Webcast **\n\nHologic’s management will host a conference call at 4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
