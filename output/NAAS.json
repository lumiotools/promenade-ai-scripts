During this quarter,\ncharging services revenues reached RMB42.4 million (US$6.0 million) with a growth rate of 36% year over\nyear. Meanwhile, our strategy to move away from low margin energy solution projects resulted in a reduction\nof energy solutions revenues by 99% year over year to RMB0.6 million (US$0.1 million). Overall, the reduction\nof revenues from low margin energy solution projects contributed to the 55% reduction in total revenues year\nover year despite the robust growth in both our charging services revenues and new initiatives revenues.\nThe 36% growth in charging services revenues year over year was mainly attributable to steady growth in GTR3\nand NTR for NaaS’ charging services, as its market presence and network strengths began to deliver tangible\nbenefits. Charging volume and number of orders transacted through NaaS’ network reached 1,284 GWh and\n52.8 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024, while the proportion of orders with positive NTR\nincreased to 73%. These factors contributed to an increase in revenue generated from its charging services.\nNaaS offers platform-based incentives to end-users to boost the use of its network. Charging services revenues\nare recorded net of end-user incentives. Costs associated with end-user incentives and recorded as reductions to\ntotal revenues totaled RMB109.2 million (US$15.6 million) and RMB82.9 million for the third quarter of 2024\nand 2023, respectively.\nThe decrease in energy solutions revenues by 99% year over year was primarily attributable to our strategy to\nshift away from low margin and infrequent energy solutions projects.\nNew initiatives revenues were RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an\nincrease of 71% year over year. This growth was primarily driven by the Company’s efforts to derive new\nsources of income from promotion services over its charging services network.\nCost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin\nTotal cost of revenues decreased 73% year over year to RMB19.3 million (US$2.8 million) for the third quarter\nof 2024. We have reduced costs by a greater margin to revenue growth as less resources were deployed for\nenergy solution projects with lower margins.\nThe robust performance of our charging services business drove a record-high gross margin of 57%. Our gross\nprofit for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB25.2 million (US$3.6 million) as compared to RMB28.6 million in\nthe same period 2023.\nOperating expenses\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 70% year over year to RMB83.3 million (US$11.9 million) for the third\nquarter of 2024. Total non-IFRS operating expenses4 decreased by 67% year over year to RMB68.4 million\n(US$9.7 million) for the third quarter of 2024. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased year\nover year to 187% for the third quarter of 2024 from 279% for the third quarter of 2023, while non-IFRS\noperating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased year over year to 154% for the third quarter of 2024\nfrom 211% for the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to the optimization in operations.\n3 GTR means Gross Take Rate and is calculated as the percentage of NaaS’ commission income derived from the gross transaction\nvalue at charging stations, indicating the Company's share of charging stations’ gross income.\n4 Non-IFRS operating expenses were arrived at after excluding share-based compensation expenses from operating expenses.\nPlease refer to the section titled “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for details.\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased by 81% year over year to RMB29.7 million (US$4.2 million) for the\nthird quarter of 2024. The decrease was mainly attributable to reduction in incentives to end-users as ongoing\nenhancements in our service enable us to lessen the reliance on user subsidies to induce usage. Costs associated\nwith excess incentives to end-users recorded as selling and marketing expenses were RMB16.0 million (US$2.3\nmillion) for the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB78.0 million in the same period of 2023. The\nsignificant reduction in these costs was attributable to the realization of network benefits and continuous\nenhancement in our service which enabled the Company to manage platform-based incentives as a percentage\nof the commission fees it generated through its charging services more effectively.\nAdministrative expenses decreased by 52% year over year to RMB48.7 million (US$6.9 million) for the third\nquarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the optimization of the Company’s organizational and\noperational structure.\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 72% year over year to RMB4.9 million (US$0.7 million) for\nthe third quarter of 2024 as the Company refines the balance of resources dedicated to technical developments.\nFinance costs\nFinance costs were RMB5.5 million (US$0.8 million) for the third quarter of 2024.\nIncome tax\nIncome tax benefits were RMB59.5 million (US$8.5 million) for the third quarter of 2024, compared with\nincome tax expenses of RMB2.3 million for the same period of 2023 as we materialize tax benefits from certain\noperating entity that turned profitable.\nNet loss and non-IFRS net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders; net margin and non-IFRS net\nmargin\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB7.7 million (US$1.1 million) for the third quarter of\n2024, compared with a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB366.9 million for the same period\nin 2023. Non-IFRS net profit5 attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB21.2 million (US$3.0 million) for\nthe third quarter of 2024, compared with non-IFRS net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB175.7\nmillion for the same period in 2023. Net margin for the third quarter of 2024 was negative 17%, compared with\nnegative 371% for the same period of 2023. Non-IFRS net margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 48%,\ncompared with negative 178% for the same period of 2023.

Through strategic focus and resource optimization technology, we are well-positioned to capitalize on market developments and drive the Company's sustainable growth.\"\n\nMr. Steven Sim, Chief Financial Officer of NaaS, added, \"In the third quarter of 2024, we made significant strides in profitability, achieving four consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement, culminating in a record high of 57%. This progress was propelled by our strategic focus on core charging services business and disciplined approach to efficiency enhancement and cost reduction, which have led to substantial decreases in operating costs through refined management and resource optimization. Moreover, by proactively discontinuing lower-margin offline businesses, we have significantly bolstered our financial health. These results demonstrate our commitment to disciplined financial management and delivering sustained value for our stakeholders.\"\n\n**Business Updates****:**\n\n**_Strategy_**\n\n**1._Highlighting AI-Driven Evolution in EV Charging at CIFTIS 2024_**\n\nIn September 2024, Ms. Yang Wang, Chief Executive Officer of NaaS, delivered a keynote speech at the 2024 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS) during the UAE-Beijing Economic Forum.

This strategic move underscores NaaS' dedication to advancing sustainable practices and enhancing green, low-carbon initiatives across the industry. \"Joining the China ESG Alliance is a pivotal step for NaaS as we continue to drive sustainable practices across our entire operation,\" stated Ms. Yang Wang, Chief Executive Officer of NaaS.\n\n**2024 Third** **Quarter****Financial Results**\n\n**_Revenues_**\n\nTotal revenues reached RMB44.4 million (US$6.3 million) for the third quarter of 2024. During this quarter, charging services revenues reached RMB42.4 million (US$6.0 million) with a growth rate of 36% year over year. Meanwhile, our strategy to move away from low margin energy solution projects resulted in a reduction of energy solutions revenues by 99% year over year to RMB0.6 million (US$0.1 million). Overall, the reduction of revenues from low margin energy solution projects contributed to the 55% reduction in total revenues year over year despite the robust growth in both our charging services revenues and new initiatives revenues.\n\nThe 36% growth in charging services revenues year over year was mainly attributable to steady growth in GTR[3] and NTR for NaaS' charging services, as its market presence and network strengths began to deliver tangible benefits. Charging volume and number of orders transacted through NaaS' network reached 1,284 GWh and 52.8 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024, while the proportion of orders with positive NTR increased to 73%. These factors contributed to an increase in revenue generated from its charging services. NaaS offers platform-based incentives to end-users to boost the use of its network. Charging services revenues are recorded net of end-user incentives. Costs associated with end-user incentives and recorded as reductions to total revenues totaled RMB109.2 million (US$15.6 million) and RMB82.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in energy solutions revenues by 99% year over year was primarily attributable to our strategy to shift away from low margin and infrequent energy solutions projects.\n\nNew initiatives revenues were RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million) for the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 71% year over year. This growth was primarily driven by the Company's efforts to derive new sources of income from promotion services over its charging services network.\n\n**_Cost of revenues, gross profit and gross margin_**\n\nTotal cost of revenues decreased 73% year over year to RMB19.3 million (US$2.8 million) for the third quarter of 2024. We have reduced costs by a greater margin to revenue growth as less resources were deployed for energy solution projects with lower margins.\n\nThe robust performance of our charging services business drove a record-high gross margin of 57%. Our gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was RMB25.2 million (US$3.6 million) as compared to RMB28.6 million in the same period 2023.\n\n**_Operating expenses_**\n\nTotal operating expenses decreased by 70% year over year to RMB83.3 million (US$11.9 million) for the third quarter of 2024. Total non-IFRS operating expenses[4] decreased by 67% year over year to RMB68.4 million (US$9.7 million) for the third quarter of 2024. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased year over year to 187% for the third quarter of 2024 from 279% for the third quarter of 2023, while non-IFRS operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased year over year to 154% for the third quarter of 2024 from 211% for the third quarter of 2023, mainly due to the optimization in operations.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased by 81% year over year to RMB29.7 million (US$4.2 million) for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was mainly attributable to reduction in incentives to end-users as ongoing enhancements in our service enable us to lessen the reliance on user subsidies to induce usage. Costs associated with excess incentives to end-users recorded as selling and marketing expenses were RMB16.0 million (US$2.3 million) for the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB78.0 million in the same period of 2023. The significant reduction in these costs was attributable to the realization of network benefits and continuous enhancement in our service which enabled the Company to manage platform-based incentives as a percentage of the commission fees it generated through its charging services more effectively.\n\nAdministrative expenses decreased by 52% year over year to RMB48.7 million (US$6.9 million) for the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily due to the optimization of the Company's organizational and operational structure.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 72% year over year to RMB4.9 million (US$0.7 million) for the third quarter of 2024 as the Company refines the balance of resources dedicated to technical developments.\n\n**_Finance costs_**\n\nFinance costs were RMB5.5 million (US$0.8 million) for the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**_Income tax_**\n\nIncome tax benefits were RMB59.5 million (US$8.5 million) for the third quarter of 2024, compared with income tax expenses of RMB2.3 million for the same period of 2023 as we materialize tax benefits from certain operating entity that turned profitable.\n\n**_Net loss and non-IFRS net_**** _profit_**** _attributable to ordinary shareholders; net margin and non-IFRS net margin_**\n\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB7.7 million (US$1.1 million) for the third quarter of 2024, compared with a net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB366.9 million for the same period in 2023. Non-IFRS net profit[5] attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB21.2 million (US$3.0 million) for the third quarter of 2024, compared with non-IFRS net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB175.7 million for the same period in 2023. Net margin for the third quarter of 2024 was negative 17%, compared with negative 371% for the same period of 2023. Non-IFRS net margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 48%, compared with negative 178% for the same period of 2023. Please refer to the section titled \"Unaudited reconciliations of IFRS and non-IFRS measures\" for details.\n\n[1] Non-IFRS net profit was arrived at after excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of convertible instruments, and fair value changes of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss from net profit. Please refer to the section titled \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" for details.  \n---  \n[2] NTR means Net Take Rate and measures NaaS' return from transactions arising from its mobility connectivity services after adjusting for incentives which are paid to end-users through NaaS' partnered platform in the form of discounts and promotions to boost the use of its network. NTR is calculated by taking NaaS' gross receipts from transactions, deducting transaction outgoings and incentives, and adding income from membership programs. The result is then expressed as a percentage of the total transaction value.  \n[3] GTR means Gross Take Rate and is calculated as the percentage of NaaS' commission income derived from the gross transaction value at charging stations, indicating the Company's share of charging stations' gross income.  \n[4] Non-IFRS operating expenses were arrived at after excluding share-based compensation expenses from operating expenses. Please refer to the section titled \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" for details.  \n[5] Non-IFRS net profit was arrived at after excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of convertible instruments, and fair value changes of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss from net profit. Non-IFRS net margin was calculated by dividing non-IFRS net profit by total revenue. Please refer to the section titled \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\" for details.  \n  \n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company's management will host an earnings conference call at 8:00 AM U.S. Eastern time on November 20, 2024 (9:00 PM Beijing/Hong Kong time on November 20, 2024).\n\nFor participants who wish to join the conference using dial-in numbers, please complete online registration using the link provided below prior to the scheduled call start time.\n\nParticipant Online Registration:\n\n<https://dpregister.com/sreg/10194471/fdf6d1042c>\n\nUpon registration, each participant will receive details for the conference call, including dial-in numbers, passcode and a unique access PIN.
