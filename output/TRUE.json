          "content": "Q3 2024\nStockholder\nLetter\nTo Our Fellow Stockholders\nAs we continue to navigate the turnaround of TrueCar’s legacy business while simultaneously laying the\nfoundation for what TrueCar aims to become, we acknowledge that the TrueCar story is nuanced and requires\ninvestors to evaluate and underwrite the distinct opportunities that exist for both our legacy and future\nbusinesses. Driving strong near-term growth of the legacy business requires that we embrace and lean into the\nunique competitive advantages that, over nearly two decades, have helped TrueCar forge its identity as a\nleading vehicle listings and lead gen provider. However, for us to effectively innovate and carve out our role in\nthe future of automotive retail, we must be willing to evolve the identity we have long embraced. This year\nalone, we have launched a broad suite of digital marketing solutions for both dealers and original equipment\nmanufacturers (“OEMs”) and we became the first and only digital marketplace that enables consumers to buy a\nnew, certified pre-owned, or used vehicle entirely online. Furthermore, we have taken steps to begin\nmonetizing our rich proprietary datasets, recognizing the potential to unlock powerful insights for our partners\nand enable an increased level of personalization across the consumer buying journey. While these initiatives\nrepresent a natural extension of our unique competitive strengths, they also represent a departure from the\ntraditional role of a third-party listings and lead gen provider. As such, we want to take this opportunity to\nbetter define and articulate the diverse range of opportunities TrueCar envisions across these segments.\nTRUECAR REIMAGINED\n1 - Legacy Business: Core Lead Generation & OEM Incentives\nTrueCar has long been recognized for empowering its network of TrueCar Certified Dealers to connect with\nhigh-intent car shoppers that trust TrueCar for its delivery of transparent pricing on new, certified pre-owned,\nand used vehicles. Since 2005, TrueCar has scaled to play a critical role within the automotive retail ecosystem\nby leveraging several distinct competitive advantages that have earned us a reputation for providing\nhigh-quality new car leads and made TrueCar a trusted partner for nearly every major franchise dealer group\nin the United States. These unique competitive strengths include:\n1. New Vehicle Shopper UX: TrueCar is the preeminent listings site for new car buyers due to its\ndifferentiated consumer experience that leverages our integrated OEM vehicle build data to empower\nnew car shoppers visiting TrueCar to customize their new vehicle search in order to match the most\ndetailed trim-specific build criteria. Outside of TrueCar, shoppers can only find this new-vehicle build\nexperience on OEM or franchise dealer sites. These platforms are inherently challenging to navigate for\nconsumers who are interested in cross-shopping different brands. On TrueCar, however, consumers can\nshop across nearly 11,500 TrueCar Certified Dealers that collectively boast approximately 1.2 million new\nvehicle listings, representing over 40% of new vehicle inventory nationwide.\n2. Exclusive Affinity Network: One of TrueCar’s primary competitive advantages is its Affinity Network, which\ncomprises over 250 membership organizations such as Sam's Club, AAA and Navy Federal Credit Union.\nThese partnerships are uniquely tailored to reflect the distinct attributes and member bases of TrueCar’s\nAffinity Partners and are actively maintained to evolve and grow in the face of changing markets and\nconsumer habits. As the exclusive auto-buying partner to nearly all of these organizations, TrueCar powers\nwhite-labeled/co-branded car-buying sites for the benefit of their members who can gain access to private\ntargeted offers from Certified Dealers and OEMs alike. As the only third-party listings site with a powerful\n2\nnetwork of Affinity Partners, TrueCar is able to provide its dealer partners with access to a closed\necosystem of high-converting car shoppers that are already engaged with the TrueCar platform and\ncannot be replicated by competitors.\n3. OEM Incentive Programs: In addition to providing TrueCar Certified Dealers with access to unique\nhigh-quality leads, the Affinity Network enables TrueCar to power targeted incentive programs on behalf\nof OEMs. As the only third-party platform with the ability to offer targeted OEM incentives to a closed\necosystem of car shoppers, TrueCar uniquely addresses a common challenge faced by all OEMs: offering\ndiscounts and incentives to strategically increase market share without eroding residual values.\nTrueCar’s competitive strengths and differentiated position among competing third-party listings sites enabled\nthe Company to grow its penetration of U.S. franchise dealers to greater than 50% in 2020 before the global\nchip shortage drove new vehicle supply to unprecedented lows. Such macroeconomic challenges contributed\nto more than one-third of TrueCar’s franchise dealer base leaving the platform from 2020 to 2022. In an\nenvironment where demand for new vehicles far outstripped supply and the average new vehicle retailed well\nabove the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (“MSRP”), TrueCar’s competitive strengths and value\nproposition were diminished from the perspective of most franchise dealers. Similarly, OEMs that were unable\nto produce enough vehicles to meet demand ceased virtually all incentives. Over this period, our unique\npositioning and differentiated value proposition, which had enabled us to penetrate over half of all U.S.\nfranchise dealers, disproportionately impacted our business relative to our competitors over this period.\nHowever, over the last 18 months, these unprecedented conditions that presented profound headwinds have\nbegun to shift into tailwinds for growth. With new vehicle supply continuing its trajectory towards\npre-pandemic levels and franchise dealer lots beginning to bloat, we are gradually but consistently rebuilding\nour franchise dealer base. Meanwhile, OEMs have begun to re-enter the market with incentives to stimulate\nnew-vehicle demand in the face of high consumer financing costs and with that, our unique incentive program\ncapabilities are increasingly in demand. Therefore, while the post-pandemic market environment\ndisproportionately impacted TrueCar’s business, current conditions and the market’s projected trajectory over\nthe next several years appear to favor TrueCar and its unique competitive strengths, positioning the Company\nfor strong near-term growth and market share gains across its core franchise lead generation and OEM\nbusiness lines.\n3\n2 - TrueCar Marketing Solutions\nThe value of TrueCar also lies in the innovative offerings and new business lines it has recently launched as\nwell as the untapped monetization opportunities that exist within the Company’s rich proprietary data sets.\nFacing the recent headwinds discussed above, TrueCar has taken significant steps to evolve its product\nofferings to better meet the needs of today’s consumers, dealers and OEMs. These products include:\n1. TrueCar Marketing Solutions (“TCMS”): Launched in Q1 2024, TCMS is a suite of marketing products\ndesigned to leverage TrueCar's proprietary data sets to help dealers more effectively target and acquire\nconsumers. These products are tailored to address the significant decline in marketing efficiency that\nmany dealers have experienced over the last several years and represent a sizable expansion of TrueCar's\naddressable market given that franchise dealers in the U.S. spend roughly $9 billion annually on\nadvertising1, a large share of which is allocated to traditional search engine marketing and paid social\nchannels that have recently experienced sharp efficiency declines.\n2. OEM Ad Sales: While TrueCar’s legacy business model derives revenues from OEMs through its targeted\nincentive programs, the Company has never sold ad placements as a way to monetize its monthly\naudience of over 7 million unique shoppers. Seeing the opportunity to build ad placements into the site\nin a manner that actually enhances rather than detracts from the consumer experience, TrueCar recently\naugmented its website with an integrated ad server that enables OEMs to effectively advertise and drive\nconsumer awareness for their brands, marking the Company’s initial expansion into the large addressable\nmarket of OEM digital advertising, which totaled $19 billion in 20232. Most importantly, enabling OEMs\nto compete for impressions and capture share of new car buyers is a natural and complementary\nextension of TrueCar’s existing OEM incentive programs that is expected to deepen the Company’s\nexisting OEM partnerships.\n3 - The TRUE Online Transaction Marketplace: TC+ (with Wholesale)\nTrueCar+ (“TC+”): Arguably the most consequential new product that TrueCar has developed, TC+ enables\nconsumers to buy a new, certified pre-owned, or used vehicle entirely online from the comfort of their couch.\nWith the beta launch of TC+ within California on July 17, 2024, which followed several years of product\ndevelopment and millions of dollars of R&D, TrueCar became the first and only automotive marketplace to\nenable a fully-digital car buying experience. The significance of this milestone cannot be overstated because\ndespite the many companies that claim to sell cars online, few of them have solved the myriad complexities of\na fully-digital end-to-end transaction. TC+ establishes the first marketplace platform through which consumers\ncan complete the essential transaction steps for purchasing a new, certified pre-owned, or used vehicle in less\nthan 10 minutes from the comfort of their couch. Once scaled nationwide, TC+ has the potential to disrupt the\nautomotive retail ecosystem and break down the barriers that have limited e-commerce adoption by providing\nconsumers with the convenience and flexibility to buy a car online anywhere in the country while providing\ndealers with a retailing solution that expands their addressable market and grows their bottom line through\n1 National Automobile Dealers Association, 2023 Annual Financial Profile of America’s Franchised New-Car Dealership\n2 Statista, “Automotive Industry Digital Advertising Spending”\n4\nsales efficiencies and enhanced pricing power. Moreover, an analysis of consumer verticals that have\nexperienced a shift towards e-commerce over the last 20 years shows that the adoption of online buying within\neach vertical is quickly followed by the emergence of a digital marketplace that rapidly achieves scale by\nproviding buyers and sellers across fragmented markets with an easy way to transact. TC+ seeks to become the\nmodern marketplace for car buying and selling.\nAlso, an efficient and fully-deployed marketplace combined with all of the Company’s transaction data\npositions the Company to establish more accurate real-time trade-in values. As such, we believe that TC+ has\nthe potential to effectively replace the traditional wholesale market as it will allow dealers to have direct access\nto the most up-to-date and efficient end-consumer pricing, avoiding the need to go through wholesalers.\n4 - Data Monetization & AI/ML Platform Opportunities\nThe Company has a robust technology and data foundation utilizing key partnerships for data management\nand is implementing a development approach governed by artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning\n(“ML”). To enable future value creation, TrueCar is rapidly growing its marketing technology (“MarTech”) stack,\nleveraging industry leading technologies that will allow the Company to further enhance the consumer and\ndealer experience through AI/ML driven solutions as well as operationalize a full-fledged retail media network\nsupporting OEM marketing and rolling out advanced generative AI use cases. After a thorough evaluation of\nTrueCar’s extensive proprietary data sets in Q3, we identified several near- and medium-term use cases that\nhave the potential to drive outsized value across three themes:\n1. Optimized Consumer Shopping Experience - driving consumer traffic and loyalty by offering a\npersonalized car-buying experience that leverages rich clickstream data and TrueCar’s proprietary\nincentive, purchase, and lending configuration data. Specific use cases include ML-driven car\nrecommendations, personalized price ratings, real-time inventory badging, and a generative AI shopping\nassistant.\n2. Value Driven Dealer Experience - enhancing our value proposition for dealers by leveraging TrueCar’s\nclosed-loop attribution capabilities, first-party consumer data and integrations with third-party data vendors\nto provide dealers with actionable insights and analytics on every lead. TrueCar’s rich historical data can\nbe effectively utilized to develop high-accuracy lead classification and consumer-propensity models.\n3. Retail Media Network - utilizing TrueCar’s consumer intelligence, DMS sales integrations, and lookalike\nmodeling capabilities to provide OEMs and dealers with access to high-quality audiences through tailored\nmedia assets that can be published across a range of platforms and channels.\nWe are prioritizing key use cases across each of these themes and developing robust future state roadmaps\nagainst them. In addition, we have made significant enhancements to our data practices and architecture to\nstrengthen the capabilities of our MarTech stack as well as enable the development of specific modular AI/ML\nmodels that will unlock key improvements to the consumer and dealer experiences on TrueCar.\n5\nQ3 PERFORMANCE\nNow that we have defined TrueCar’s unique advantages, which we are leveraging to drive near-term growth\nand position TrueCar for a much larger role in the future of automotive retail, let us turn to highlights from the\nthird quarter which we believe demonstrate strong traction against these near-term and longer-term goals.\nThe launch of the TC+ pilot on July 17, 2024 was an incredible milestone for the Company. The excitement we\nfelt at launch was quickly eclipsed when we successfully fulfilled the first used vehicle order followed by our\nfirst new vehicle order. These orders were completed 100% online without any offline interactions between the\ndealer and consumer. The significance of this cannot be overstated, as it represents a new way of buying and\nselling a vehicle that, simply put, has not been done before. With these orders successfully fulfilled, the pilot’s\nprimary objective has been achieved and each subsequent order has provided new learnings and insights that\nare driving the refinement of both the consumer and dealer experiences. In total, approximately 30 consumers\nhave completed the entire process online, each culminating with the digital execution of a Retail Installment\nContract (“RIC”) and, more importantly, these orders came from consumers across 13 different states,\nproviding strong early evidence that TC+ has the power to significantly expand a dealer’s addressable market\nbeyond its backyard. And while the total number of transactions might not seem significant at first, thus far,\nTC+ has only been exposed to a subset of consumers within specific flows on TrueCar.com that collectively\naccount for a fraction of our total monthly unit sales. In fact, over the past 30 days, TC+ accounted for roughly\nhalf of the volume that the pilot dealer traditionally generates through those flows, suggesting that when fully\nenabled, TC+ can account for a significant share of a dealer’s total volume. This deliberate and controlled\napproach to opening up the consumer aperture and expanding the number of shoppers going through the\nTC+ flow has allowed the team to closely measure and monitor each step of the process for insights and\nopportunities that have already helped us refine and improve the product and remove friction from both the\nconsumer and dealer experience. Now in the next phase of the pilot, we are preparing to introduce TC+ on\ncertain Affinity Partner auto-buying sites which will significantly expand access to the TC+ flow and should\nallow TrueCar to observe key differences in consumer adoption across a diverse set of audiences. Beyond\nexpanding consumer access to TC+, our focus and objectives for the pilot in Q4 include integrating\nAI-powered tools that strengthen our ability to detect and mitigate the risk of consumer fraud and continuing to\nenhance our integration with our dealers’ backend systems to further streamline the TC+ buying process on\nthe dealer side. These first 90 days have been richly rewarding through the validation and learnings they have\noffered and as we look ahead, the team is incredibly excited and energized by the opportunity that TC+\nrepresents. Finally, we are extremely grateful for the partnership shown by the dealer group piloting our\nproduct and are looking forward to adding additional dealers throughout California and beyond over the next\nseveral months.\n6\nTurning now to a summary of Q3 financial and operational highlights. Total revenue in Q3 was $46.5 million,\nrepresenting a $5.4 million (or 13.1%) increase from the same period last year and a $4.7 million (or 11.4%)\nincrease from the prior quarter. Our Q3 net loss decreased to $5.8 million from $7.9 million in Q3 2023 and\nwe achieved adjusted EBITDA3 profitability of $0.2 million, down from $0.8 million in the same period last\nyear, primarily due to $0.8 million of non-recurring consulting expenses.\nOur core franchise dealer business continued to strengthen in Q3 with franchise dealer revenue growing\n12.7% YoY and 5.5% QoQ. Most importantly, despite the industry’s 1.3% YoY decline in industry new vehicle\nretail sales in Q3, TrueCar grew new vehicle sales by 16.3% YoY driven, in part, by the incremental marketing\ninvestments we have been making over the last six months. This equates to nearly seven new unit sales per\nfranchise dealer, which is the highest level since Q3 2021! As we have previously articulated, a key building\nblock for achieving our long-term growth objectives is to regain our share of franchise dealers through\nactivating new dealers and minimizing churn and in order to achieve that we must demonstrate TrueCar’s\nability to capture share of total new vehicle sales by delivering strong new unit growth in excess of the overall\nindustry growth.\nAnother sign of the strengthening of our core franchise dealer business is the adoption of TrueCar Marketing\nSolutions (“TCMS”) and in Q3, this relatively new product offering contributed $1.0 million of dealer revenue.\nEven more encouraging is the performance being achieved by this suite of marketing products. By leveraging\nour first-party data to help dealers reach highly targeted audiences across a variety of channels, TrueCar is\nhelping dealers achieve significant improvements in their marketing efficiency while growing their overall sales\nvolumes. Given that growing revenue per dealer is another core building block for achieving our 2026\nrevenue target, TCMS is allowing us to capture a greater share of wallet and drive real traction against this\nbuilding block.\nIn addition to the momentum of our franchise dealer business, our OEM business remains strong and\npositioned for near-term growth. Despite being down 11.5% YoY, a decline attributed to two heavily marketed\nincentive programs during the same period last year, Q3 OEM revenue increased by $1.4M (or 45%) from the\nsecond quarter driven by strong performance of an incentive program that reactivated in June. As we have\ndiscussed previously, factors that impact the performance of incentive programs include the incentive amounts\nbeing offered, the breadth of models eligible for incentives, and the number of affinity partners targeted\nthrough the program.\n3 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” below, for its definition and a reconciliation to\nnet loss, the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n7\nBeyond incentives, TrueCar signed up its first two OEM advertisers in Q3, marking the launch of a new\nadvertising service to complement our incentive program capabilities and deepen our OEM partnerships.\nThese deals were enabled by recent investments we have made to strengthen our MarTech stack through an\nintegrated ad server capable of running dynamic targeted advertisements across a variety of onsite\nplacements. Priced on a fee per impression basis, these placements offer OEMs an effective way to drive\nawareness and consideration among the 7 million in-market car shoppers that visit TrueCar each month and do\nit in a way that is effectively integrated into the superior shopping experience that TrueCar is known for.\nFurthermore, the launch of ad sales represents a high-margin opportunity for TrueCar to incrementally\nmonetize TrueCar’s millions of unique visitors and opens us up to capture a share of the estimated $19 billion\nspent annually on digital marketing by OEMs4.\nFinally, we remain committed to the three-year target that we set last year to grow revenue back to $300 million\nwith a 10% free cash flow margin by the end of 2026. Achieving that goal requires strong execution against\nthe four key building blocks we have discussed and for us to continue pushing to build a better version of\nTrueCar that deserves to play a key role in the automotive retail ecosystem. To that end, in Q4 we aim to\naccelerate YoY revenue growth beyond the 13.1% achieved in Q3 and we seek to deliver positive free cash\nflow in the quarter5.\nTo infinity and beyond!\nJantoon Reigersman Oliver Foley\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer\n4 Statista, “Automotive Industry Digital Advertising Spending”\n5 Free cash flow and free cash flow margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

However, demand seems to be lagging due to ongoing\naffordability concerns. While pricing trends such as lower transaction prices and reduced interest rates have\nmade new cars seem more accessible compared to recent years, average monthly payments remain near\nrecord highs and OEM incentives remain well below historical levels. Although monthly payments for used\ncars also remain near their historic highs, the spread between the average new and used monthly payments\ngrew in Q3, seemingly contributing to many buyers opting to purchase used cars, as evidenced by YoY and\nQoQ increases in used vehicle sales.\nVehicle Sales Volumes\nNew vehicle retail sales in Q3 2024 totaled 3.5 million units, representing a 1.3% decline YoY. Through the\nend of August, Q3 new vehicle retail sales were up 4.1% YoY but were offset by September sales volumes\ncoming in 11.9% lower than prior year. Despite significantly higher new vehicle supply and a modest decline\nin new vehicle list prices versus last year, new vehicle affordability continues to challenge many consumers.\nUsed vehicle retail sales in Q3 totaled 4.5 million units, representing 9.8% growth YoY as the affordability of\nused car purchases improved from last year driven by a 2.4% decrease in the average list price of used\nvehicles and a 3.2% decrease in the average monthly payment on a used car loan.\nMONTHLY NEW AND USED VEHICLE RETAIL SALES (Industry)\nNew Vehicle Sales Used Vehicle Sales\nSource: Motor Intelligence and Cox Automotive\n10\nInventory and Supply Trends\nIn September 2024, new vehicle inventory hit the highest level since April 2020 reaching 2.89 million units,\nan increase of 63 thousand units (or 2%) QoQ and 875 thousand units (or 43%) YoY. The QoQ growth was\ndriven primarily by Korean brands, which accounted for 51 thousand units (or 81%) of the overall increase.\nMeanwhile, inventory levels for domestic, Japanese, and European brands remained relatively flat. YoY, the\nindustry saw significant gains across the board, with domestic brands increasing by 353 thousand units\n(29%), Japanese brands increasing by 217 thousand units (43%), Korean brands by 169 thousand units\n(146%), and European brands by 126 thousand units (81%). Despite the sustained recovery in new inventory,\nit continues to remain well below 2019 levels, which ranged between 3.5 million and 4.1 million units.\nNEW VEHICLE INVENTORY (Industry)\n2.89M\nYoY +43%\nSource: Motor Intelligence\n11\nNew Vehicle Inventory Growth (Industry)\nYoY or Since September 2023\nQoQ or Since June 2024\nSource: Motor Intelligence\n12\nAs of the end of September, average days' supply for new vehicles stood at 56 days compared to 55 days\nand 39 days as of the end of June 2024 and September 2023, respectively. Notably, Mazda and Kia\nexperienced the largest 90-day increases in days’ supply with Mazda rising from 32 to 49 days and Kia\ngrowing from 36 to 47 days. In contrast, Mitsubishi and BMW saw significant declines since June dropping\nfrom 61 to 31 days and 48 to 36 days, respectively. On a YoY basis, domestic, Japanese, European, and\nKorean brands increased their days’ supply by 16 days (28%), 12 days (42%), 25 days (84%) and 30 days\n(144%), respectively.\nDAYS’ SUPPLY ACROSS BRANDS (Industry) - September 2024\nSource: Motor Intelligence\n13\nVehicle Pricing and Affordability\nIn September 2024, the Consumer Price Index (CPI, not seasonally adjusted) for new vehicles reached\n177.4, reflecting little change since Q1 2023. However, to provide context, pre-pandemic CPI levels for\nnew vehicles consistently ranged between 146 and 149 from 2014 to 2019, underscoring how elevated\nprices remain today. This substantial increase highlights the continued affordability challenges in the new\nvehicle market.\nFurther illustrating these challenges, approximately 17% of new vehicles were sold above MSRP in\nSeptember 2024. Although this represents a decline from 19% in June 2024 and 39% from September\n2023, it remains substantially higher than the pre-pandemic range of 3.9% to 6.1%.\nThe average new vehicle list price in September was $48.7 thousand, a 3.6% decline from $50.5 thousand\nin the prior year, and largely unchanged from June 2024. However, when compared to the\nSeptember 2020 average list price of $36.3 thousand, today’s new vehicles are priced 34% above where\nthey stood four years ago. This represents a four-year compounded annual growth rate of nearly 8%, which\nfar outstrips the rate of inflation and wage growth over that period and is a stark deviation from the\nhistorical rate of growth for new vehicle prices.\nESTIMATED MONTHLY TRANSACTION PRICES\nSource: Cox Automotive, Q3 2024 Industry Insights and Sales Forecast Call\n14\nAn analysis of new vehicle list prices on TrueCar highlights this pricing shift with nearly 59% of TrueCar\ninventory priced above $40.0 thousand as compared to 35% in 2019 and 2020. Moreover, the share of\nnew inventory listed below $30.0 thousand has declined from 40% in 2020 to approximately 16% in 2024,\nwhich is likely contributing to a large share of U.S. consumers being priced out of the new vehicle market.\nNEW VEHICLE INVENTORY SHARE BY LIST PRICE\nShare of\nInventory\n> $40K\n58.5%\nvs. 35.3% in 2019\nand 35.1% in 2020\n>$60K $50K - $60K $40K - $50K $30K - $40K $20K - $30K < $20K\nSource: TrueCar\n15\nOEM incentives on new vehicles continued to rise in Q3 2024, averaging $3.5 thousand per new vehicle\nsold, a 50% increase YoY and a 16% increase QoQ. Compared to 2019’s average incentive amount per new\nvehicle of $3.8 thousand, the incentive amount per new vehicle in September 2024 was only 7% lower,\nsuggesting that the industry has nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels; however, to appropriately compare\ntoday’s OEM incentives to those of the past, the average new vehicle list price must be accounted for. In 2019,\nthe average incentive amount per new vehicle was 10.3% of the new vehicle list price, whereas in Q3 2024 it\nrepresented 7.1%. As such, if OEMs were to provide new vehicle incentives comparable to 2019 and equal to\n10.3% of the new vehicle list price, the average incentive amount in Q3 2024 would need to be\n$5.0 thousand per vehicle - an additional $1.6 thousand per vehicle (or 45% increase) from current levels.\nThis discrepancy is very likely contributing to new vehicle sales growth not keeping pace with the growth of\nnew vehicle supply.\nOEM NEW VEHICLE INCENTIVES - Avg. $ per Vehicle vs. % of List Price\nIncentives per Vehicle Incentives as % of List Price\nSource: Motor Intelligence\n16\nIn addition, incentives offered over the past 18 months have primarily involved OEMs leveraging their\ncaptive financing arms to offer low APRs and attractive lease terms. As such, through the first half of 2024,\ncaptives accounted for 61% of new auto loans, up from 46% in 20226. Even more striking is the YTD growth\nin the share of new vehicle sales that are leased, which has increased from 19% in 2022 to over 25% in\n2024. The reason why one in four new vehicle sales are being leased is that the average monthly lease\npayment on a new vehicle is $148 (or 20%) lower than the monthly payment on a new vehicle loan,\nhighlighting the extent to which OEMs have been leaning into attractive lease terms to incentivize demand.\nFinally, looking at auto loan financing trends more broadly, the average APR on a new vehicle loan\ndecreased during Q3 to 6.9% in September 2024, down from 7.6% in September 2023 and 7.2% in June\n2024. Despite the more favorable financing terms, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle loan\nincreased during the quarter to $778, up from $768 in both June 2024 and September 2023, driven by an\nincrease in the average amount financed.\nFor used vehicles, CPI showed a YoY decline of 5.1%. In the market, the average list price fell by 2.4% YoY\nto $30.1 thousand, with the average monthly payment decreasing by 3.2% to $569. Interest rates for used\ncar loans also declined from 11.3% in Q3 2023 to 11.1% in Q3 2024.\nNEW AND USED VEHICLE FINANCING TRENDS\nAverage Loan Term in Months Average APR Average Amount Financed\nNew Used\nSource: Motor Intelligence\nFinally, a noteworthy trend in automotive finance is the continued shift towards prime and super-prime\nbuyers. Subprime and deep subprime buyers accounted for only 14.9% of vehicle loan and lease\ntransactions in Q2 2024, down from 20.7% in 2019. Conversely, prime and super-prime buyers now\nmake up 69.4% of transactions, reflecting a shift in the lending landscape that may influence future\nsales trends.7\n6 & 7 Experian, State of the Automotive Finance Market Q2 2024.

OEM revenue decreased by $0.6M\n(or 11.5%) YoY attributed to two heavily marketed incentive\nprograms during Q3 2023. Sequentially, OEM revenue was up\n$1.4 million (or 45%) from the second quarter of 2024, primarily\ndriven by strong performance of a reactivated incentive program\nthat was only live for one month during the second quarter and\npartially driven by the $0.4 million estimated impact of the CDK\noutage on our second quarter OEM revenue. We maintain our\nbelief that OEM incentives will be pivotal to driving new vehicle\nsales across the industry over the near term and are actively\npartnering with several brands to reintroduce and broaden their\nincentive programs on the TrueCar platform.\n19\nQuarterly Metrics\nDealer count at the end of the third quarter was 11,409,\ncomprising 8,303 franchise dealers and 3,106 independent\ndealers. Independent dealer count declined by 8.8% YoY and\n2.9% sequentially, partly attributed to the sustained trend of\ndealer consolidations and shutdowns. Meanwhile, franchise\ndealer count increased by 2.5% YoY and 0.4% sequentially,\ndriven by the onboarding of new franchise dealers and\nreactivation of dealers that left our network when the supply of\nnew vehicle inventory was constrained.\nConsumer traffic averaged 6.9 million monthly unique visitors\nin the third quarter of 2024, down from 8.1 million in Q3 2023\nand from 7.7 million in Q2 2024. The YoY and sequential\ndecline in monthly unique visitors is attributed to a more\nefficient allocation of customer acquisition spend to channels\nwith high-converting audiences.\n20\nTotal third quarter units were 95 thousand as compared to\n83 thousand during the same quarter last year and 89 thousand\nin the second quarter of 2024. Total units grew by 14.2% YoY\nand 6.4% sequentially with new units increasing 16.3% YoY and\n7.3% sequentially. The mix of new vehicles as a percentage of\ntotal units was 57.0% in the third quarter of 2024 as compared\nto 56.0% of total units in the third quarter of 2023 and 56.5% in\nthe second quarter of 2024.\nMonetization per unit decreased to $490 from $495 during the\nthird quarter of 2023 and was up from $468 in the second\nquarter of 2024. The YoY decrease in monetization is attributed\nto unit growth exceeding revenue growth on a YoY basis, while\nthe sequential increase in monetization was primarily driven by\nthe strong QoQ growth in OEM incentives revenue.\n21\nExpenses and Margin\n(Reconciliations of non-GAAP metrics used in this letter to their nearest GAAP\nequivalents are provided at the end of this letter under “Financial Statements\nand Non-GAAP Financial Measures”).\n(Millions)\nThird quarter gross profit, defined as revenues less cost of\nrevenue, was $38.8 million which is an increase of $1.5 million\n(or 4.0%) YoY and $2.5 million (or 6.9%) QoQ. This represents\na gross margin of 83.4% on a GAAP basis, which was down\nfrom 90.7% in the same period last year and 86.9% in the\nsecond quarter. The YoY and sequential decrease in gross\nmargin is primarily attributed to the growth of TCMS and\nwholesale revenue which have a lower gross margin than core\ndealer revenue.\nTechnology and development expenses were $7.2 million on a\nGAAP basis and $6.7 million on a non-GAAP basis in the third\nquarter of 2024, down 23.1% and 10.6%, respectively, versus\nthe same period last year. The YoY decreases primarily resulted\nfrom reduced recurring headcount, software, and hosting costs\nand one time severance costs during the prior year.\nSequentially, technology and development expenses decreased\n3.4% on a GAAP basis and increased 2.2% on a non-GAAP\nbasis. The sequential decline on a GAAP basis primarily\n(Millions)\nstemmed from severance costs during the prior quarter while\nthe sequential increase on a non-GAAP basis is driven by\nincreased headcount expenses in the third quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $9.6 million on a\nGAAP basis and $7.4 million on a non-GAAP basis in the third\nquarter of 2024, up 0.4% and up 7.9% YoY, respectively. On a\nGAAP basis, the YoY increases were largely driven by an\nincrease in non-recurring third-party consulting expenses\npartially offset by lower severance and lease exit costs. On a\nnon-GAAP basis, the YoY increase in non-recurring third-party\nconsulting was not offset by the severance and lease exit costs.\nSequentially, general and administrative expenses decreased\n38.1% on a GAAP basis and increased 16.9% on a non-GAAP\nbasis. The sequential GAAP decrease was mainly the result of a\n$6.9 million impairment of our right-of-use asset associated with\nterminating an office lease in the second quarter of 2024 while\non a non-GAAP basis, the sequential increase in general and\nadministrative expenses was largely driven by an increase in\nnon-recurring third-party consulting fees.\n22\nSales and marketing, our largest expense category, was $25.0 million on a GAAP basis and $24.6 million\non a non-GAAP basis in the third quarter of 2024, up 8.2% and 10.7%, respectively, versus the third\nquarter of 2023. Sequentially, sales and marketing expenses were up 4.6% on a GAAP basis and 5.1% on\na non-GAAP basis.\nWithin sales and marketing expense, TrueCar.com acquisition expense was $5.7 million, up 7.5% YoY and\ndown 14.9% sequentially. Cost per sale for TrueCar.com units was $197, up 7.2% YoY and down 17.7%\nsequentially. Partner marketing spend was $10.1 million in the third quarter, up 20.2% YoY and 11.3%\nsequentially driven by the strong growth in units attributed to the partner network. Cost per sale for partner\nmarketing was $154, down 1.2% YoY and up 3.2% sequentially. Finally, headcount-related and other sales\nand marketing expenses were $9.2 million on a GAAP basis and $8.8 million on a non-GAAP basis in the\nthird quarter of 2024, down 2.2% and up 3.3% YoY, respectively. The YoY increase on a non-GAAP basis\nwas primarily driven by higher recurring headcount expenses. However, on a GAAP basis this increase\nwas offset by a decrease in severance costs compared to the prior year. Sequentially, headcount and other\nsales and marketing expenses increased 13.2% on a GAAP basis and 15.1% on a non-GAAP basis. The\nsequential increases were primarily due to increased sales commission costs associated with the increased\nrevenue in the third quarter of 2024.\nIn summary, we maintained our focus on managing expenses while making key investments in growing\nunit sales for our dealer partners and initiatives aligned with our key building blocks to achieve our\nlong-term growth targets.\nBalance sheet and cash usage\nWe ended the third quarter of 2024 with approximately $114.5 million in cash and equivalents, as\ncompared to $145.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023 and $128.0 million at the end of the\nsecond quarter of 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, $12.7 million in cash was used to repurchase\nand retire shares of common stock. We continue to have no debt.\n23\nLive Call and Webcast Details Investor relations:\ninvestors@truecar.com\nTrueCar’s management will host a call to discuss third quarter financial\nresults on Thursday, November 7, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.\nMedia:\nA live webcast of the call can be accessed from the Investor Relations\nTrueCar media line:\nsection of our website and by using this link.

All statements contained herein other than statements of\nhistorical fact are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our revenue growth, including\nour ability to surpass year-over-year revenue growth of 13.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024 while achieving\npositive free cash flow, as well as aspirational goals regarding 2026 revenue and free cash flow margin, the\nnear and long-term growth and revenue opportunities of our core, OEM and marketing business lines, our\nability to monetize our proprietary data for the benefit of dealers and our affinity partners and generate\nvalue through an improved marketing technology stack, including through the implementation of artificial\nintelligence and machine learning capabilities, our ability to regain or activate new dealers and limit dealer\nchurn, grow our TrueCar Marketing Solutions product offering, and our ability to scale our TrueCar+\noffering in California and nationwide and its potential to disrupt the automotive retail ecosystem, including\nwholesale markets, and benefit dealers once scaled as well as our expectations about the macroeconomic\nenvironment, including possible developments that may benefit our business, such as increases in inventory\nlevels and in OEM incentive offers, the likelihood of consumers being priced out of new vehicles, the\nimpact of the shift in automotive lending to prime and super-prime borrowers and the importance of OEM\nincentive in driving near-term growth. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks,\nuncertainties and assumptions that may prove incorrect, any of which could cause our results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, and include, among others,\nthose risks and uncertainties described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, our\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 filed with the SEC, our Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC and our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to be filed with the SEC. These risks include, but are\nnot limited to, the following:\n● Our business is subject to risks related to the larger automotive ecosystem, including recent low\nautomobile inventory supply levels, which adversely impacted our business, results of operations and\nprospects.\n● If our lead quality or quantity declines, our unit volume could as well, and dealers could leave our\nnetwork or insist on lower subscription rates, which could reduce our revenue and harm our business.\n● If we are not successful in rolling out new offerings, including our TC+ offering, providing a compelling\nvalue proposition to consumers using these offerings, integrating our current and future offerings into\nsuch experiences or monetizing them, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.\n● Actions that we have taken in the past and may take in the future to restructure our business in alignment\nwith our strategic priorities may not be as effective as anticipated.\n25\n● The growth of our business relies significantly on our ability to maintain and increase the revenues that\nwe derive from dealers in our network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. Failure to do so would harm our\nfinancial performance.\n● We may not be able to provide a compelling car-buying experience to our users, which could cause the\nnumber of transactions between our users and dealers, and therefore our revenues, to decline.\n● Economic and other conditions that impact consumer demand for automobiles, including interest rates,\ninflation, fuel prices and the impacts of public health events, may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n● We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business and\nfuture operating results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nMoreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time\nto time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can management assess the impact of\nall factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual\nresults to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. All\nforward-looking statements in this document are based on information available to our management as of the\ndate of this press release and, except as required by law, management assumes no obligation to update\nthose forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their respective dates.\n26\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document includes non-GAAP financial measures we refer to as Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and\nfree cash flow margin.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss adjusted to exclude interest income, depreciation and amortization,\nstock-based compensation, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liability, impairment of\nright-of-use (“ROU”) assets, interest accretion for terminated leases, restructuring charges, and income taxes.\nThe expense categories utilized to derive Adjusted EBITDA are also utilized to derive Non-GAAP expenses\nby financial statement line item (“FSLI”). We have provided below a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net\nloss as well as the GAAP expenses by FSLI to the non-GAAP expense by FSLI, the most directly comparable\nGAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any\nother measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, and non-GAAP\nexpenses should not be considered as an alternative to expenses presented in accordance with GAAP. In\naddition, our Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP expense measures may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures of other organizations as they may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP expenses in the\nsame manner as we calculate this measure.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure because it is (i) an integral part of our\nreporting and planning processes; (ii) used by our management and board of directors to assess our\noperational performance, and together with operational objectives, as a measure in evaluating employee\ncompensation and bonuses; and (iii) used by our management to make financial and strategic planning\ndecisions regarding future operating investments. We believe that using Adjusted EBITDA facilitates\noperating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis because it excludes variations primarily\ncaused by changes in the excluded items noted above. In addition, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and\nsimilar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, rating agencies and other parties in\nevaluating companies as measures of financial performance and debt service capabilities.\nOur use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation\nor as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the receipt of interest or the payment of income taxes;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n● although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and\namortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital\nexpenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditures or any other contractual\ncommitments;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment charges on our ROU assets associated with subleasing;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest accretion for the terminated office lease at 1401 Ocean\nAvenue, Santa Monica, California;\n27\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the charges associated with the Restructuring Plan initiated and\ncompleted in the second quarter of 2023 to improve efficiency and reduce expenses or a realignment of\nthe Company’s leadership structure initiated in the third quarter of 2023;\n● Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of shares issued or to be issued in\nconnection with stock-based compensation; and\n● other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently\nthan we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nWe define free cash flow as net cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, and free cash\nflow margin as free cash flow divided by revenue. Free cash flow and free cash flow margin should not be\nconsidered as alternatives to net cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of liquidity\ncalculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our free cash flow and free cash flow\nmargin measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations as they may not\ncalculate them in the same manner as we calculate these measures.\nWe use free cash flow and free cash flow margin as liquidity measures because they are used by\nmanagement to make financial and strategic planning decisions based on cash availability after maintaining\nthe needs of our primary business activities. We believe that using free cash flow and free cash flow margin\nfacilitates comparison of cash available for potential future investment opportunities because it excludes cash\nflows that are not in support of the core business operations or are from external financing.\nOur use of free cash flow and free cash flow margin has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not\nconsider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these\nlimitations are:\n● free cash flow and free cash flow margin may not reflect future contractual commitments;\n● free cash flow does not reflect cash flow provided by or used in financing activities, including payments\nmade for contingent consideration, taxes on net share settlement of equity awards, proceeds from\nexercise of common stock options, or repurchase of common stock;\n● free cash flow does not reflect cash sources or uses from investing activities that are not directly\nassociated with capital expenditures; and\n● other companies, including companies in our own industry, may calculate free cash flow and free cash\nflow margin differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and free cash flow\nmargin alongside other financial performance and liquidity measures, including our net loss, our other\nGAAP results and various cash flow metrics. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be\naware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments in deriving\nAdjusted EBITDA and you should not infer from our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA that our future results\nwill not be affected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items.\n28\nFinancial Statements And Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n29\nFinancial Statements And Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n30\nFinancial Statements And Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n31\nFinancial Statements And Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n32\nThank You"
