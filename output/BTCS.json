          "content": "# BTCS Issues Shareholder Letter Reflecting on 2023 and Outlook for 2024\n\n###### Fair Value of Crypto and Cash $26.7 Million as of December 31, 2023 Over $6m in Net Income expected for 2023 through early adoption of new accounting rules\n\n#### Dear Shareholders,\n\nAs we look back on the past year and anticipate the opportunities of 2024, I am pleased to share this annual letter with all of you, our valued shareholders who have steadfastly supported BTCS Inc.\n\n#### Ending the Year on a High Note\n\nOur strategic decisions paid off as we ended the year with considerable momentum. As of December 31, 2023, the Fair Market Value (“FMV”) of our cryptocurrency and cash rose 82% year over year to an impressive $26.7 million ($25.2 million crypto and $1.5 million cash). This significant increase is not just a number – it symbolizes the trust you place in us to navigate volatile markets and protect our assets. Additionally, the recent rise in the FMV of our crypto assets, positions us to enhance revenue in 2024, reinforcing our financial health and growth trajectory.\n\n#### Embracing New Accounting Rules for Enhanced Financial Transparency\n\nA significant development this year was the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) new accounting rules allowing cryptocurrencies to be carried at their fair market value. We plan to early adopt these rules, a decision we believe will significantly enhance the transparency and accuracy of our financial statements. This change aligns our financial reporting more closely with the economic realities of our business model. Consequently, we anticipate that if we elect to early adopt for the recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, our net income may exceed $6 million, with earnings per share estimated to be above $0.40 per share, with our current assets increasing by $23 million to approximately $27 million. This shift is expected to provide a clearer, more accurate reflection of our financial health and performance.\n\n#### Optimistic Outlook for 2024\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the landscape of cryptocurrency continues to evolve rapidly. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs marked a significant milestone and we anticipate the launch of an Ethereum ETF, although the timing is uncertain, which we believe will further catalyze market acceptance and growth. This development aligns perfectly with our strategic focus on Ethereum-based solutions and infrastructure.\n\n#### Innovations and Future Plans\n\nIn our product development, which has been a core focus of our efforts over the last year, we are excited about the future launch of the following products:\n\n![](https://www.btcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/builder-300x69.png)Builder+, a significant enhancement to our Ethereum blockchain infrastructure, is our newly developed Ethereum block builder, which utilizes advanced algorithms to meticulously construct optimized blocks for on-chain validation designed to maximize validator earnings. We believe Builder+ should provide a path to scalable revenue on Ethereum’s blockchain with limited additional costs.\n\n![](https://www.btcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/chainq-300x53.png)ChainQ, is an under-development AI-powered blockchain data and analytics platform, designed to allow users to query real-time and historical on-chain blockchain data. Through comprehensive indexing of public blockchain data from our Blockchain Infrastructure operations, ChainQ is intended to provide an intuitive and straightforward platform for users to access on-chain data.\n\n![](https://www.btcs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/facebc58-4799-4fd1-8a2e-a366dd268af4-300x67.jpg)StakeSeeker, we are exploring the feasibility of adding Ethereum non-custodial staking to our StakeSeeker platform in 2024, with the goal of further diversifying our revenue streams and focusing on expanded and scalable offerings in the cryptocurrency space.\n\n#### Enhancing Online Presence and Communication\n\nIn line with our commitment to transparency and shareholder engagement, we plan to update our corporate website. This revamp aims to better reflect our initiatives, strategies, and the evolving nature of our business. Additionally, we plan to release a new corporate presentation designed to provide deeper insights into our operations and the exciting opportunities we foresee. These enhancements to our digital presence are part of our broader strategy to ensure open, clear, and continuous communication with you, our shareholders.\n\n#### Strategic Cost-Cutting Initiatives Amidst Market Challenges\n\nIn most of 2023, we faced significant challenges as the industry emerged from crypto winter. In stark contrast to many of our public peers who resorted to toxic funding methods, thereby destabilizing their capital structures, we adopted a more sustainable approach. Our strategic cost-cutting initiatives, focused on operational efficiency, allowed us to weather this period without compromising our product development or our market position. This prudent approach was pivotal in maintaining our financial stability and protecting shareholder value in a volatile market.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nAs your CEO, I am proud of what we have accomplished in the face of adversity, and enthusiastic about the opportunities that lie ahead. Your trust and support are the backbone of our success, and we remain dedicated to delivering on our promise of innovation, growth, and sustainability in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.\n\nThank you for your continued support and trust.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nCharles Allen CEO, BTCS Inc.\n\n**About BTCS:** BTCS Inc. is a Nasdaq listed company operating in the blockchain technology sector since 2014 and is one of the only U.S. publicly traded companies with a primary focus on proof-of-stake blockchain infrastructure.

It is a distribution in excess of an entity’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Different from dividend income and capital gains distributions, return of capital distributions are currently non-taxable to shareholders, unless the distribution exceeds the shareholder’s basis in the stock prior to the distribution. Instead, a shareholder’s tax cost basis of the stock is reduced by the amount of the distribution, which increases the amount of capital gains (or decreases the capital loss) to be recognized when a shareholder sells his or her shares. The portion of distribution payments that are considered return of capital rather than taxable income will be reported in Box 3 of the Form 1099-DIV that BTCS shareholders receive at the end of each tax year for a BTCS stock investment. It is possible that a portion of a distribution is classified as return of capital whereas the remaining portion of the distribution is considered taxable income.\n\n#### What are earnings and profits?\n\n“Earnings and profits” is a tax accounting term that is applicable in the context of distributions made by a corporation. Earnings and profits represent a form of economic income based upon taxable income with certain adjustments. Earnings and profits are increased through earnings and decreased through losses and dividends to shareholders. If the current year’s or accumulated earnings and profits are greater than all distributions made during the year, the distributions are taxable dividends. But, if the payout is greater than the company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits, the portion of the distribution in excess of the current and accumulated earnings and profits is a currently non-taxable return of capital that reduces a shareholder’s cost basis, unless, as noted above, the distribution exceeds the shareholder’s stock basis just prior to the distribution. If there is such an excess, that amount must be treated by the shareholder as capital gain.\n\n#### Where do shareholders receive information about return of capital distribution allocation each year?\n\nBTCS is required to complete and post on its website IRS Form 8937 which will provide details on the expected changes to tax basis on BTCS shares due to a portion of BTCS distribution being classified as return of capital vs. dividend income for tax purposes. This form will be posted to the BTCS Investor Relations website within 45 days after a dividend payment if the distribution is expected to impact shareholder basis. Final estimation of return of capital vs. taxable dividend treatment is reported to shareholders on the Form 1099-DIV at the end of each tax year. The amount of the return of capital distribution will be reported in Box 3 of Form 1099-DIV.\n\n#### Who maintains a shareholder's cost basis information?\n\nIt is the responsibility of each BTCS shareholder to maintain the cost basis of their BTCS investment. Shareholders should consult their own tax advisors as to their specific tax consequences. BTCS is not staffed with tax personnel and does not provide tax advice.\n\n## Give us a call or send us an email anytime.
