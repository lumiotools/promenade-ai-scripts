Forward-looking statements are those that are not historical facts. The words “may,” “will,” “anticipate,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “believe,” “contemplate,” “expect,” “aim,” “plan,” “estimate,” “continue,” and “intend,”, the negative of these terms, as well as other similar words and expressions of the future, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements related to our projected growth, anticipated future financial performance, and management’s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on our results of operations and financial condition from expected or potential developments or events, or business and growth strategies, including anticipated internal growth and balance sheet restructuring.\n\nThese forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\n  * the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations;\n  * our ability to successfully manage interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and other risks inherent to our industry;\n  * the accuracy of our financial statement estimates and assumptions, including the estimates used for our credit loss reserve and deferred tax asset valuation allowance;\n  * the efficiency and effectiveness of our internal control procedures and processes;\n  * our ability to comply with the extensive laws and regulations to which we are subject, including the laws for each jurisdiction where we operate;\n  * adverse changes or conditions in capital and financial markets, including actual or potential stresses in the banking industry;\n  * deposit attrition and the level of our uninsured deposits;\n  * legislative or regulatory changes and changes in accounting principles, policies, practices or guidelines, including the on-going effects of the implementation of the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) standard;\n  * the lack of a significantly diversified loan portfolio and the concentration in the South Florida market, including the risks of geographic, depositor, and industry concentrations, including our concentration in loans secured by real estate, in particular, commercial real estate;\n  * the effects of climate change;\n  * the concentration of ownership of our common stock;\n  * fluctuations in the price of our common stock;\n  * our ability to fund or access the capital markets at attractive rates and terms and manage our growth, both organic growth as well as growth through other means, such as future acquisitions;\n  * inflation, interest rate, unemployment rate, and market and monetary fluctuations;\n  * impacts of international hostilities and geopolitical events;\n  * increased competition and its effect on the pricing of our products and services as well as our interest rate spread and net interest margin;\n  * the loss of key employees;\n  * the effectiveness of our risk management strategies, including operational risks, including, but not limited to, client, employee, or third-party fraud and security breaches; and\n  * other risks described in this earnings release and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\n\n\n\nAll forward-looking statements are necessarily only estimates of future results, and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ materially from expectations. Therefore, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements included in this earnings release are made only as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. You should also review the risk factors described in the reports the Company filed or will file with the SEC.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis earnings release includes financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This financial information includes certain operating performance measures. Management has included these non-GAAP measures because it believes these measures may provide useful supplemental information for evaluating the Company’s operations and underlying performance trends. Further, management uses these measures in managing and evaluating the Company’s business and intends to refer to them in discussions about our operations and performance. Operating performance measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to or substitute for, measures determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in the ‘Non-GAAP Reconciliation Tables’ included in the exhibits to this earnings release.\n\nAll numbers included in this press release are unaudited unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Contacts:**\n\n**Investor Relations**[InvestorRelations@uscentury.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=i5RpG3DEJYYOdCP1jf3c4a50dP6-golP2mL08nItI_5TUVRM3WZgEoJkVBPLD-n97SP-jQnD4mmMwXm6HaMvYrWE8yDvfF5MpIVN7tweIb-635kRXkl0--IGGctn3X_c)\n\n**Media Relations** Martha Guerra-Kattou [MGuerra@uscentury.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=NsMeIip98cYbfngGyxatn77fmsOZRPMNCuE9WtjPjnQddNYC9kwu1BCmBgN3Bzi_zZb6Xl8RZp7G58nFVGFOnJ3KflxpUrghFesaauXlj9E=)\n\n**USCB FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (UNAUDITED)**  \n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)  \n**Three Months EndedSeptember 30,**| **Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n**Interest income:**  \nLoans, including fees| $| 29,819| $| 22,523| $| 84,479| $| 63,081  \nInvestment securities| 2,754| 2,833| 8,634| 7,501  \nInterest-bearing deposits in financial institutions| 989| 1,026| 3,953| 2,459  \nTotal interest income| 33,562| 26,382| 97,066| 73,041  \n**Interest expense:**  \nInterest-bearing checking deposits| 411| 331| 1,171| 574  \nSavings and money market accounts| 10,064| 8,779| 30,529| 20,532  \nTime deposits| 3,391| 2,565| 9,907| 5,767  \nFHLB advances and other borrowings| 1,587| 685| 4,881| 1,976  \nTotal interest expense| 15,453| 12,360| 46,488| 28,849  \nNet interest income before provision for credit losses| 18,109| 14,022| 50,578| 44,192  \nProvision for credit losses| 931| 653| 2,127| 892  \nNet interest income after provision for credit losses| 17,178| 13,369| 48,451| 43,300  \n**Non-interest income:**  \nService fees| 2,544| 1,329| 6,172| 3,707  \nGain (loss) on sale of securities available for sale, net| -| (955| )| 14| (976| )  \nGain on sale of loans held for sale, net| 109| 255| 593| 696  \nOther non-interest income| 785| 1,532| 2,334| 2,650  \nTotal non-interest income| 3,438| 2,161| 9,113| 6,077  \n**Non-interest expense:**  \nSalaries and employee benefits| 7,200| 6,066| 20,863| 18,325  \nOccupancy| 1,341| 1,350| 3,921| 3,968  \nRegulatory assessments and fees| 452| 365| 1,361| 1,041  \nConsulting and legal fees| 161| 513| 1,016| 1,257  \nNetwork and information technology services| 513| 481| 1,499| 1,464  \nOther operating expense| 1,787| 1,686| 5,528| 5,034  \nTotal non-interest expense| 11,454| 10,461| 34,188| 31,089  \nNet income before income tax expense| 9,162| 5,069| 23,376| 18,288  \nIncome tax expense| 2,213| 1,250| 5,606| 4,464  \nNet income| $| 6,949| $| 3,819| $| 17,770| $| 13,824  \n**Per share information:**  \nNet income per common share, basic| $| 0.35| $| 0.20| $| 0.90| $| 0.70  \nNet income per common share, diluted| $| 0.35| $| 0.19| $| 0.90| $| 0.70  \nCash dividends declared| $| 0.05| $| -| $| 0.15| $| -
