Revenue was $906.5 million, net income attributable to ChampionX was $72.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $197.5 million. Income before income taxes margin was 11.2% and adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.8%. Cash from operating activities was $141.3 million and free cash flow was $108.1 million.\n\n**_CEO Commentary_**\n\n“The third quarter demonstrated the resiliency of our ChampionX portfolio as we delivered strong adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, and generated robust free cash flow. These results were the direct result of our employees around the world remaining laser-focused on serving our customers well, and I am grateful to them for their dedication to our corporate purpose of improving lives,” ChampionX’s President and Chief Executive Officer Sivasankaran “Soma” Somasundaram said.\n\n“During the third quarter of 2024, we generated revenue of $907 million, which decreased 4% year-over-year, as growth in North America, Middle East & Africa, Europe, and Asia Pacific was offset by Latin America, which was impacted by lower sales in Mexico. Revenue from all areas other than Mexico increased 6% year-over-year. Our revenue increased 1% sequentially, with both North America and international revenues increasing slightly versus the second quarter. North America revenues were up 2% sequentially, driven primarily by higher sales volumes in our artificial lift business. International revenues were up 1% sequentially, driven, in part, by the contribution of RMSpumptools, which was acquired during the quarter. We generated net income attributable to ChampionX of $72 million, income before income taxes margin of 11.2%, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $198 million, representing a 21.8% adjusted EBITDA margin, our highest level as ChampionX, which speaks to the productivity and profitability focus of our team.\n\n“Cash flow from operating activities was $141 million during the third quarter, which represented 196% of net income attributable to ChampionX, and we generated strong free cash flow of $108 million, which represented 55% of our adjusted EBITDA for the period. We remain confident in achieving at least 50% adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow conversion for 2024. Our balance sheet and financial position remain strong, ending the third quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity, including $389 million of cash and $671 million of available capacity on our revolving credit facility.”\n\n**_Agreement to be Acquired by SLB_**\n\nOn April 2, 2024, SLB (NYSE: SLB) and ChampionX jointly announced a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) for SLB to purchase ChampionX in an all-stock transaction. The transaction was unanimously approved by the ChampionX board of directors and the transaction received the approval of the ChampionX stockholders at a special meeting held on June 18, 2024. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. It is currently anticipated that the closing of the transaction will occur in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nChampionX may continue to pay its regular quarterly cash dividends with customary record and payment dates, subject to certain limitations under the Merger Agreement. Given the pending acquisition of ChampionX by SLB, ChampionX has discontinued providing quarterly guidance and will not host a conference call or webcast to discuss its third quarter 2024 results.\n\n**_Production Chemical Technologies_**\n\nProduction Chemical Technologies revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $559.5 million, a decrease of $10.0 million, or 2%, sequentially, due primarily to lower international sales volumes.\n\nSegment operating profit was $87.3 million and adjusted segment EBITDA was $120.6 million. Segment operating profit margin was 15.6%, an increase of 60 basis points, sequentially, and adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 21.6%, an increase of 94 basis points, sequentially. The sequential increase in segment operating profit margin and adjusted segment EBITDA margin was driven by strong cost management, productivity improvements, and favorable product mix.\n\n**_Production & Automation Technologies_**\n\nProduction & Automation Technologies revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $275.7 million, an increase of $31.2 million, or 13%, sequentially, due primarily to higher artificial lift systems demand in North America, and the acquisition of RMSpumptools, which was completed during the quarter. Revenue from digital products was $57.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 7% sequentially, driven by increased customer activity in North America.\n\nSegment operating profit was $34.1 million and adjusted segment EBITDA was $69.6 million. Segment operating profit margin was 12.4%, an increase of 330 basis points, sequentially, and adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 25.2%, an increase of 118 basis points, sequentially. The increase in segment operating profit margin and adjusted segment EBITDA margin was driven by higher sales volumes, productivity improvements, and favorable product mix.\n\n**_Drilling Technologies_**\n\nDrilling Technologies revenue in the third quarter of 2024 was $51.8 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 2%, sequentially, driven by lower sales volumes in the bearings product line associated with customers managing inventory levels.\n\nSegment operating profit was $11.5 million and adjusted segment EBITDA was $12.9 million. Segment operating profit margin was 22.2%, compared to 22.4% in the prior quarter, and adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 24.8%, a decrease of 2 basis points, sequentially, due primarily to lower volumes.\n\n**_Reservoir Chemical Technologies_**\n\nReservoir Chemical Technologies revenue in the third quarter 2024 was $20.5 million, a decrease of $6.6 million, or 24%, sequentially, driven by lower sales volumes in the U.S. and internationally.\n\nSegment operating profit was $1.7 million and adjusted segment EBITDA was $3.3 million. Segment operating profit margin was 8.2%, a decrease of 793 basis points, sequentially, and adjusted segment EBITDA margin was 16.0%, a decrease of 592 basis points, sequentially.

The company was a finalist in four additional categories: SMARTEN™ XE ESP control system in the best controls, instrumentation, automation technology category; Pump Checker™ gas lift analysis module in the best digital transformation – upstream category; Chemical Technologies Decarbonization Program in the best HSE contribution category; and the ChampionX Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion programs in the DE&I in energy category.\n\n\n\n**_Other Business Highlights: Production Chemical Technologies and Reservoir Chemical Technologies_**\n\n  * In the Asia Pacific region, ChampionX secured a significant new contract to provide both engineering services and the initial chemical supply for a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) unit, set to be deployed at a large gas condensate field in Australasia. Operations are scheduled to begin in the first half of 2025 and contribute significantly to regional Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity. This strategic win further strengthens our presence in the region and reinforces our commitment to delivering innovative, high-quality solutions to our upstream customers.\n  * ChampionX was awarded a large first-fill contract to supply multiple production chemicals for corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors, and biocides for a major onshore oil and gas incremental project in Saudi Arabia.\n  * ChampionX has secured a first-fill contract to supply production chemicals for a significant gas development program in Qatar.\n  * ChampionX secured a multi-million-dollar order for a novel application of UltraFab in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) for delivery in 2025.\n  * ChampionX recently completed the pre-commission cleaning, chemical treatment, and readiness work for the 303-mile natural gas Mountain Valley Pipeline connecting Marcellus and Utica shale production to markets in the Mid- and South-Atlantic regions.\n  * In the Canadian oil sands, ChampionX completed a steam additive first-fill program for a major technology development trial, leading to additional market interest.\n  * ChampionX was awarded a three-year contract extension from a major producer in the San Juan Basin in California, recognizing our service, people, and commitment to helping the producer achieve their strategic goals as reasons for the extension.\n  * As part of an initiative to expand our technology into adjacent markets, ChampionX Reservoir Chemical Technologies was awarded business with a premier supplier of local sand used for hydraulic fracturing in the Permian Basin. Our solution affords the supplier a significant savings on sand drying costs and is designed to increase operational throughput.\n\n\n\n**_Other Business Highlights: Production & Automation Technologies_**\n\n  * In the third quarter, ChampionX completed the acquisition of RMSpumptools, a provider of advanced mechanical and electrical solutions for complex ESP systems. The acquisition expands ChampionX’s international footprint while providing greater opportunities for RMSpumptools in North America. Soon after the acquisition close, our Permian ESP team collaborated with RMSpumptools to deliver a sand control solution to a major oil company operating in the Permian basin.\n  * ChampionX Artificial Lift expanded its Latin America footprint into Ecuador with a contract award for two 400HP multiplex surface pump systems for jet lift applications. This accomplishment is the result of a strengthening partnership with a Latin America independent operator that is expanding its operations from Colombia to Ecuador. Unlike typical systems, the surface pump and oil vessel required for jet lifted wells will be built on one skid with all the necessary piping, which reduces assembly time at the wellsite.\n  * Building on the combined strengths of our XSPOC artificial lift software and the acquisition of Artificial Lift Performance Limited Pump Checker software, ChampionX introduced ALLY™ production optimization digital solutions, debuting a modern interface with user-friendly dashboards and intuitive workflows, paired with powerful performance—ingesting, processing, and displaying more data than ever before. It is a one-stop-shop for production teams to manage and optimize their producing assets, regardless of lift type or equipment provider. Building on the launch of this new digital solution, in the third quarter ChampionX secured seven new clients for our production optimization software solution.\n  * ChampionX launched the PCS Ferguson new generation SMARTEN™ Unify control system, which is engineered to deliver sophisticated digital automation and optimization capabilities at a cost of ownership that fits within the narrow economic profile of plunger lifted wells. SMARTEN Unify provides enhanced visibility to what is happening “live” at any second in a plunger lift system, eliminating the need for operating based on calculated guesses.\n\n\n\n**_Other Business Highlights: Drilling Technologies_**\n\n  * Drilling Technologies’ diamond bearings products continue to see positive test results in additional downhole drilling and completion tools applications.\n  * Drilling Technologies’ diamond inserts business had significant new products launches with four major customers.\n\n\n\n**_About Non-GAAP Measures_**\n\nIn addition to financial results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), this news release presents non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net income attributable to ChampionX and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ChampionX, provide useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because they reflect the core operating results of our businesses and help facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods. In addition, free cash flow, free cash flow to adjusted EBITDA ratio, and free cash flow to revenue ratio are used by management to measure our ability to generate positive cash flow for debt reduction and to support our strategic objectives. Although management believes the aforementioned non-GAAP financial measures are good tools for internal use and the investment community in evaluating ChampionX’s overall financial performance, the foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is included in the accompanying financial tables.\n\n**_About ChampionX_**\n\nChampionX is a global leader in chemistry solutions, artificial lift systems, and highly engineered equipment and technologies that help companies drill for and produce oil and gas safely, efficiently, and sustainably around the world.
