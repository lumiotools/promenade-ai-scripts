If these results continue, we believe we will have a clear path forward for clinical development of IMM-1-104 in combination with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel for pancreatic cancer. Importantly, our recent Fast Track and Orphan Drug designations from the FDA may help advance development of this potentially important new therapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. With enrollment progressing well in our Phase 2a arms, we expect to share further data by year end and we look forward to providing updates on our progress at that time.”\n\n**Corporate Highlights**\n\n  * **FDA Orphan Drug Designation for IMM-1-104 in the Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer** : In October 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug designation to IMM-1-104 in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\n  * **Positive Initial Phase 2a Data Including Complete and Partial Responses with IMM-1-104 in Combination with Chemotherapy in First-Line Pancreatic Cancer Patients** : In September 2024, Immuneering announced positive initial response data from the first five patients treated with IMM-1-104 in combination with modified gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in first line pancreatic cancer as part of its ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial. If the early trends with IMM-1-104 in combination with modified gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel continue, management believes there is a clear path forward for clinical development of IMM-1-104 in pancreatic cancer, which has the potential to improve the prognosis for a drastically underserved patient population.\n\n\n  * **FDA Fast Track Designation for IMM-1-104 in First-line Pancreatic Cancer:** In July 2024, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for IMM-1-104, as a first-line treatment for patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).\n\n\n\n**Near-Term Milestone Expectations**\n\nIMM-1-104\n\n  * Initial data from at least one additional arm of the Phase 2a portion of the Company’s Phase 1/2a trial is expected by year end.\n\n\n\nIMM-6-415\n\n  * Initial PK, PD and safety data from the Phase 1 portion of the Company’s Phase 1/2a trial is expected by year end.\n\n\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Highlights**\n\n**Cash Position:** Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 were $50.7 million, compared with $85.7 million as of December 31, 2023. The September 30, 2024 figure includes $4.2 million of net proceeds from the Company’s ATM facility.\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) Expenses:** R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $11.3 million, compared with $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to higher clinical costs related to the Company’s lead program and increased personnel to support ongoing research and development activities.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses: **G&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $4.0 million, compared with $3.9 million for the **t** hird quarter of 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily attributable to an increase in the Company’s stock-based compensation costs and employee-related costs in connection with general and administrative functions.\n\n**Net Loss:** Net loss attributable to common stockholders was $14.6 million, or $0.49 per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $12.6 million, or $0.43 per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**2024 Financial Guidance**\n\nBased on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and current operating plans, the Company expects its cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\n**About Immuneering Corporation**\n\nImmuneering is a clinical-stage oncology company seeking to develop and commercialize universal-RAS/RAF medicines for broad populations of cancer patients with an initial aim to develop a universal-RAS therapy.

IMM-1-104 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer, in which positive initial response data was [recently reported](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=SF9ySpn0Oq3jbg3IWUGDXTo87EBjURW7cXnrQjdGoAgNPvn5zToq9-V3pvYDJq2Bazs6hpj0us3G3-ITpmbDQyDk7YHyM8redVPkFiHpp-iZ98rMJYPs8YSva_rafc-pnNcILEg3sQdlyWtqK9N0vTe7m0oMEApnngdqadL4bBvjm13whSyYKwpz8QBX3HD6bNJUPelkC62JxCzBYqmtggW_S1syxvnaBMWgKF1SffA=) for first line pancreatic cancer patients treated in combination with modified gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.\n\n“The FDA’s granting of orphan drug designation for IMM-1-104 underscores the urgent need for new therapies that meaningfully improve outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients and represents an important milestone in the development of our lead asset,” said Ben Zeskind, Ph.D., Co-Founder and CEO of Immuneering. “I believe our recently announced positive initial Phase 2a data, from our arm investigating IMM-1-104 in combination with modified gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in pancreatic cancer, speaks to IMM-1-104's potential to improve upon the current standard of care in this indication. Importantly, in the same trial we are also studying IMM-1-104 in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX, as well as in monotherapy for pancreatic cancer. We look forward to providing initial data from at least one additional arm of the Phase 2a portion of our Phase 1/2a trial before the end of the year.”\n\nFDA orphan drug designation is granted to investigational therapies addressing rare medical diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation may qualify sponsors for incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical trials, exemptions from certain FDA fees and additional time for post-approval marketing exclusivity. Earlier this year, Immuneering was granted [FDA Fast Track designation for IMM-1-104](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3R1z_KmoP4MmxfBGZ6ouvC8SgAW5fftIG3GTnqpGGLRrnA8i2jQALM-uUyApENB-8qtROBru6JBg1nBBas91SlRhnAFAj_OVjqFI3gZwBGBnJJ-LcZ4FT6KiwRPPaX5FwEDt7ZwyZhHYNohouSxgD0GJzyV9zdjPMO4bRIFB9oq5EFBOq248QG5BTx3C4PDdLlObi4jgwR5UhcXSEf5gfH2n48L5xT23L8li3WO_Mv-ww8Eni0lbhMtuGxiTfXuY) for the treatment of both first and second-line pancreatic cancer.\n\n**About IMM-1-104**\n\nIMM-1-104 aims to achieve universal-RAS activity that selectively impacts cancer cells to a greater extent than healthy cells, through Deep Cyclic Inhibition of the MAPK pathway with once-daily dosing. IMM-1-104 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2a study in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RAS mutations (NCT05585320).\n\n**About Immuneering Corporation**\n\nImmuneering is a clinical-stage oncology company seeking to develop and commercialize universal-RAS/RAF medicines for broad populations of cancer patients with an initial aim to develop a universal-RAS therapy. The Company aims to achieve universal activity through Deep Cyclic Inhibition of the MAPK pathway, impacting cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Immuneering’s lead product candidate, IMM-1-104, is an oral, once-daily Deep Cyclic Inhibitor currently in a Phase 2a trial in patients with advanced solid tumors including those harboring RAS mutations. IMM-6-415 is an oral, twice-daily Deep Cyclic Inhibitor currently in a Phase 1/2a trial in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring RAS or RAF mutations.
