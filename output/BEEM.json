On Thursday, November 9, 2023, CEO Desmond Wheatley live-streamed a tour of Beam Global’s newly acquired European operations. This exclusive exploration showcased the state-of-the-art Beam Europe office, cutting-edge engineering facilities, and high-capacity manufacturing plants. For those fascinated by Beam Global’s expansion, this is a fantastic opportunity to witness firsthand the extensive and well-equipped facilities that now belong to the company in the largest market for their products globally.\n\nHighlights of the tour include:\n\n  * **Introduction to Beam Europe Team:** Meet the skilled engineers and manufacturing experts from the newly formed European team, who are collaborating with their U.S. counterparts to introduce Beam Global’s patented products to a rapidly growing market.\n  * **Market Expansion:** With 210 employees, Beam Europe significantly broadens market reach, product development, and manufacturing capacity. The facilities, previously owned by Amiga, one of Europe’s leading manufacturers of streetlights, are poised to bring Beam Global’s innovative EV Standard™ to market in both Europe and the U.S.\n  * **Strategic Acquisition:** On October 24, 2023, Beam Global completed the acquisition of Amiga DOO Kraljevo, enhancing its position as a leader in the green economy. This strategic move is expected to increase barriers to entry for future competitors, fortifying Beam Global’s foothold in the European market.\n\n\n\nThank you for joining us today.\n\n[ ](# \"Scroll To Top\")\n"
