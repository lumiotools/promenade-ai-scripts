late clinical-stage medical device company focused on the advancement of innovative bioprosthetic (tissue-based) solutions to improve the standard of care for the treatment of venous disease. The Company’s lead product, the VenoValve®, is a first-in-class surgical replacement venous valve being developed for the treatment of deep venous Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI). The Company is also developing a non-surgical, transcatheter based replacement venous valve for the treatment of deep venous CVI called enVVe™. CVI occurs when valves inside of the veins of the leg become damaged, resulting in the backwards flow of blood (reflux), blood pooling in the lower leg, increased pressure in the veins of the leg (venous hypertension) and in severe cases, venous ulcers that are difficult to heal and become chronic. Both the VenoValve® and enVVe™ are designed to act as one-way valves, to help assist in propelling blood up the leg, and back to the heart and lungs. The VenoValve® is currently being evaluated in the SAVVE U.S. pivotal study and the company is currently waiting for regulatory approval to begin the TAVVE first-in-human trial for enVVe™. \n\nThe VenoValve® and enVVe® are investigational medical devices currently in development. Neither device is approved or cleared for any indication in any market. The VenoValve® is only available for use in the United States in pre-market clinical studies.\n\nWe use cookies on our website to give you the most relevant experience by remembering your preferences and repeat visits.
