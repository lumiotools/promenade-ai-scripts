Reports Better-Than-Expected Third Quarter Results And Adjusts Full Year 2024 Outlook\n\nOctober 29, 2024\n\nDownload this Press Release PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n  * **Third Quarter Diluted EPS Up 17% to $3.36 and Adjusted Diluted EPS Up 11% to $3.60**\n  * **Third Quarter Revenues Increase 2% to $1.06 Billion**\n  * **Third Quarter Crocs Brand Grows****8% Constant Currency Fueled By Balanced Channel Growth**\n\n\n\nBROOMFIELD, Colo., Oct. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX), a world leader in innovative casual footwear for all, today announced its third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n\"We reported third quarter results which exceeded our Enterprise guidance on sales and profitability,\" said Andrew Rees, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our overall performance including strong gross margin gains allowed us to accelerate our strategic investments in the quarter while continuing to deliver earnings per share growth through the deployment of our strong cash flow. Strength was led by our Crocs Brand fueled by 17% international and 8% direct-to-consumer growth.\"\n\nMr. Rees continued, \"We have sharpened our strategy around HEYDUDE as we work to create higher brand relevance through our product and marketing initiatives. While we are seeing early green shoots from these actions, HEYDUDE's recent performance and the current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we had initially planned for the brand to turn a corner. While we are resetting our full-year outlook for HEYDUDE, I remain confident in the long-term trajectory of the brand.\"\n\nAmounts referred to as \"Adjusted\" or \"Non-GAAP\" are Non-GAAP measures and include adjustments that are described under the heading \"Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.\" A reconciliation of these amounts to their GAAP counterparts are contained in the schedules below.\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Operating Results (Compared to the Same Period Last Year)**\n\n  * **Consolidated revenues** were $1,062 million, an increase of 1.6%, or 2.0% on a constant currency basis.

Adjusted income from operations of $270 million decreased 8.8% from $296 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 25.4% compared to 28.3%.\n  * **Diluted earnings per share** of $3.36 increased 17.1% from $2.87.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance does not assume any impact from potential future share repurchases.\n  * Capital expenditures of $90 million to $100 million compared to prior guidance of $100 million to $110 million.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nA conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results is scheduled for today, Tuesday, October 29, 2024, at 8:30 am ET.

AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we present \"Non-GAAP gross profit,\" \"Non-GAAP gross margin,\" \"Non-GAAP gross margin by brand,\" \"Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses,\" \"Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues,\" \"Non-GAAP income from operations,\" \"Non-GAAP operating margin,\" \"Non-GAAP income before income taxes,\" \"Non-GAAP income tax expense,\" \"Non-GAAP effective tax rate,\" \"Non-GAAP net income,\" and \"Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share,\" which are non-GAAP financial measures. We also present future period guidance for \"Non-GAAP operating margin,\" \"Non-GAAP effective tax rate,\" and \"Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\" Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented.\n\nWe also present certain information related to our current period results of operations through \"constant currency,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, in addition to corresponding GAAP measures, are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance and trends by providing meaningful information about operations compared to our peers by excluding the impacts of various differences.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, and Non-GAAP gross margin by brand are useful performance measures for investors because they provide investors with a means of comparing these measures between periods without the impact of certain expenses that we believe are not indicative of our routine cost of sales. Our routine cost of sales includes core product costs and distribution expenses primarily related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, and packaging product and transportation costs associated with delivering products from distribution centers. Costs not indicative of our routine cost of sales may or may not be recurring in nature and include costs to expand and transition to new distribution centers.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a more meaningful comparison to prior periods and may be indicative of the level of such expenses to be incurred in future periods. These measures exclude the impact of certain expenses not related to our normal operations, such as costs related to the integration of HEYDUDE and other costs that are expected to be non-recurring in nature.\n\nNon-GAAP income from operations and Non-GAAP operating margin reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, as discussed above. We believe these are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\n\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes reflects the impact of Non-GAAP income from operations, as discussed above. We believe this is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP income tax expense is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a basis to compare our tax rates to historical tax rates, and because the adjustment is necessary in order to calculate Non-GAAP net income.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP effective tax rate is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides an ongoing effective tax rate that they can use for historical comparisons and forecasting.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP net income is a useful performance measure for investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends and improves the comparability of our results to prior periods. This measure reflects the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share are useful performance measures for investors because they focus on underlying operating results and trends and improve the comparability of our results to prior periods. These measures reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management believes it is helpful to evaluate our results excluding the impacts of various adjustments relating to special or non-recurring items. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**CROCS, INC.

This adjustment represents the current period impact of these transfers.  \n  \n**_Non-GAAP Financial Guidance_**\n\nOur forward-looking guidance for consolidated \"adjusted operating margin,\" and \"adjusted diluted earnings per share\" represents non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.\n\nWhile we are able to estimate full year non-GAAP adjustments, we are unable to reconcile forward-looking adjusted measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure quarter-by-quarter because we are unable to predict the timing of these adjustments with a reasonable degree of certainty. By their very nature, special and other non-core items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures for the guidance related to the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**CROCS, INC.

Fans can even take personalization one step further and showcase their love for their four-legged companions by adorning their Classic Lined Clogs with exclusive dog Jibbitz™ charms.\n\nIn the spirit of unparalleled creativity, the fan-inspired festivities don't stop there. This year, the global footwear brand is expanding the possibilities of self-expression with the release of a new Crocs Costume, which takes form as a life-sized iconic Classic Clog. Fully loaded with Jibbitz™ charms, the costume doubles as a personal vehicle for expression, with the ventilation holes transformed into arm openings and fan's faces acting as Jibbitz™ charms. Just like your favorite pair of Crocs which come in left and right versions, the costume is also available in left and right, making it perfect for pairing up this spooky season to create the ultimate couples' moment.\n\n\"We take pride in connecting with our fans and celebrating their boundless creativity, which makes our brand truly unique,\" said Anne Mehlman, Brand President, Crocs. \"This Croctober embodies the innovative spirit of Crocs and honors our diverse fan base by demonstrating how our collective imagination can turn the ordinary into something extraordinary.\"\n\nThe Pet Crocs and their matching Classic Lined Clogs will be available globally on [Crocs.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4273895-1&h=725719558&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crocs.com%2Fc%2Fseasonal-holiday%2Fcroctober&a=Crocs.com) and in select Crocs retail stores beginning October 23 for a limited time.

(NASDAQ: CROX), a world leader in innovative casual footwear for all, today announced its third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n\"We reported third quarter results which exceeded our Enterprise guidance on sales and profitability,\" said Andrew Rees, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our overall performance including strong gross margin gains allowed us to accelerate our strategic investments in the quarter while continuing to deliver earnings per share growth through the deployment of our strong cash flow. Strength was led by our Crocs Brand fueled by 17% international and 8% direct-to-consumer growth.\"\n\nMr. Rees continued, \"We have sharpened our strategy around HEYDUDE as we work to create higher brand relevance through our product and marketing initiatives. While we are seeing early green shoots from these actions, HEYDUDE's recent performance and the current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we had initially planned for the brand to turn a corner. While we are resetting our full-year outlook for HEYDUDE, I remain confident in the long-term trajectory of the brand.\"\n\nAmounts referred to as \"Adjusted\" or \"Non-GAAP\" are Non-GAAP measures and include adjustments that are described under the heading \"Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.\" A reconciliation of these amounts to their GAAP counterparts are contained in the schedules below.\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Operating Results (Compared to the Same Period Last Year)**\n\n  * **Consolidated revenues** were $1,062 million, an increase of 1.6%, or 2.0% on a constant currency basis.

Wholesale revenues contracted 1.4%, or 0.9% on a constant currency basis.\n  * **Gross margin** was 59.6% compared to 55.6%. Adjusted gross margin improved 220 basis points to 59.6% compared to 57.4%.\n  * **Selling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG &A\")** of $364 million increased 18.1% from $308 million, and represented 34.2% of revenues compared to 29.4%.

AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we present \"Non-GAAP gross profit,\" \"Non-GAAP gross margin,\" \"Non-GAAP gross margin by brand,\" \"Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses,\" \"Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues,\" \"Non-GAAP income from operations,\" \"Non-GAAP operating margin,\" \"Non-GAAP income before income taxes,\" \"Non-GAAP income tax expense,\" \"Non-GAAP effective tax rate,\" \"Non-GAAP net income,\" and \"Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share,\" which are non-GAAP financial measures. We also present future period guidance for \"Non-GAAP operating margin,\" \"Non-GAAP effective tax rate,\" and \"Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\" Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented.\n\nWe also present certain information related to our current period results of operations through \"constant currency,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, in addition to corresponding GAAP measures, are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance and trends by providing meaningful information about operations compared to our peers by excluding the impacts of various differences.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, and Non-GAAP gross margin by brand are useful performance measures for investors because they provide investors with a means of comparing these measures between periods without the impact of certain expenses that we believe are not indicative of our routine cost of sales. Our routine cost of sales includes core product costs and distribution expenses primarily related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, and packaging product and transportation costs associated with delivering products from distribution centers. Costs not indicative of our routine cost of sales may or may not be recurring in nature and include costs to expand and transition to new distribution centers.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a more meaningful comparison to prior periods and may be indicative of the level of such expenses to be incurred in future periods. These measures exclude the impact of certain expenses not related to our normal operations, such as costs related to the integration of HEYDUDE and other costs that are expected to be non-recurring in nature.\n\nNon-GAAP income from operations and Non-GAAP operating margin reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, as discussed above. We believe these are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\n\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes reflects the impact of Non-GAAP income from operations, as discussed above. We believe this is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP income tax expense is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a basis to compare our tax rates to historical tax rates, and because the adjustment is necessary in order to calculate Non-GAAP net income.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP effective tax rate is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides an ongoing effective tax rate that they can use for historical comparisons and forecasting.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP net income is a useful performance measure for investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends and improves the comparability of our results to prior periods. This measure reflects the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share are useful performance measures for investors because they focus on underlying operating results and trends and improve the comparability of our results to prior periods. These measures reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management believes it is helpful to evaluate our results excluding the impacts of various adjustments relating to special or non-recurring items. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**CROCS, INC.

This adjustment represents the current period impact of these transfers.  \n  \n**_Non-GAAP Financial Guidance_**\n\nOur forward-looking guidance for consolidated \"adjusted operating margin,\" and \"adjusted diluted earnings per share\" represents non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.\n\nWhile we are able to estimate full year non-GAAP adjustments, we are unable to reconcile forward-looking adjusted measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure quarter-by-quarter because we are unable to predict the timing of these adjustments with a reasonable degree of certainty. By their very nature, special and other non-core items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures for the guidance related to the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**CROCS, INC.

Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure and in the same month in the following year. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce comparable revenues are based on same site sales period over period. E-commerce sites that are temporarily offline or unable to transact or fulfill orders (\"site disruption\") are excluded from the comparable sales calculation during the month of site disruption and in the same month in the following year. E-commerce site disruptions in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month after the site has re-opened.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, and previously in 2021 and 2020, we made changes to our international legal structure, including an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights, primarily to align with current and 21\nfuture international operations. The transfers resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights and correlated increases in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual\nproperty rights. This adjustment represents the current period impact of these transfers.\n3. See reconciliation to GAAP equivalents in Appendix.\nAppendix\n22\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), we present \"Non-GAAP gross profit,\" “Non-GAAP gross margin,” “Non-GAAP gross margin by brand,” \"Non-GAAP selling, general,\nand administrative expenses,” “Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues,” “Non-GAAP income from operations,” “Non-GAAP operating margin,” “Non-GAAP income before income taxes,” “Non-GAAP income tax expense,” “Non-\nGAAP effective tax rate,” “Non-GAAP net income,” and “Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share,\" which are non-GAAP financial measures. We also present future period guidance for “Non-GAAP operating margin,” “Non-GAAP effective tax rate,” and\n“Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.” Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented.\nWe also present certain information related to our current period results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under\nGAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations.\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP\nmeasures, in addition to corresponding GAAP measures, are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance and trends by providing meaningful information about operations\ncompared to our peers by excluding the impacts of various differences.\nManagement believes Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, and Non-GAAP gross margin by brand are useful performance measures for investors because they provide investors with a means of comparing these measures between periods without the impact of\ncertain expenses that we believe are not indicative of our routine cost of sales. Our routine cost of sales includes core product costs and distribution expenses primarily related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, and packaging product and transportation costs associated\nwith delivering products from distribution centers. Costs not indicative of our routine cost of sales may or may not be recurring in nature and include costs to expand and transition to new distribution centers.\nManagement believes Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a more meaningful comparison to\nprior periods and may be indicative of the level of such expenses to be incurred in future periods. These measures exclude the impact of certain expenses not related to our normal operations, such as costs related to the integration of HEYDUDE and other costs that are\nexpected to be non-recurring in nature.\nNon-GAAP income from operations and Non-GAAP operating margin reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, as discussed above. We believe these are useful performance measures for investors because\nthey provide a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes reflects the impact of Non-GAAP income from operations, as discussed above. We believe this is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\nManagement believes Non-GAAP income tax expense is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a basis to compare our tax rates to historical tax rates, and because the adjustment is necessary in order to calculate Non-GAAP net income.\nManagement believes Non-GAAP effective tax rate is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides an ongoing effective tax rate that they can use for historical comparisons and forecasting.\nManagement believes Non-GAAP net income is a useful performance measure for investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends and improves the comparability of our results to prior periods. This measure reflects the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit,\nNon-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\nManagement believes Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share are useful performance measures for investors because they focus on underlying operating results and trends and improve the comparability of our results to prior periods. These measures\nreflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management believes it is helpful to evaluate our results excluding the impacts of various adjustments relating to special or non-recurring items. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation\nfrom, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n23\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nNon-GAAP Gross Profit and Gross Margin Reconciliation:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGAAP revenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717\nGAAP gross profit $ 633,339 $ 581,636\nDistribution centers (1) — 18,797\nNon-GAAP gross profit 633,339 600,433\nGAAP gross margin 59.6 % 55.6 %\nNon-GAAP gross margin 59.6 % 57.4 %\n(1) During the three months ended September 30, 2023, adjustments represent expenses, including expansion costs and duplicate rent costs, related to our distribution centers\n24\nin Dayton, Ohio and Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Cont'd)\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin Reconciliation by Brand:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nGAAP Crocs Brand gross margin 62.5 % 61.9 %\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nDistribution centers (1) — % 0.2 %\nNon-GAAP Crocs Brand gross margin 62.5 % 62.1 %\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\nGAAP HEYDUDE Brand gross margin 47.9 % 35.6 %\nNon-GAAP adjustments:\nDistribution centers(2) — % 7.2 %\nNon-GAAP HEYDUDE Brand gross margin 47.9 % 42.8 %\n(1) Represents prior year expenses, including expansion costs and duplicate rent costs, primarily related to our distribution centers in Dayton, Ohio.\n25\n(2) Represents prior year expenses, including expansion costs, duplicate rent costs, and transitional storage costs, related to our distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Cont'd)\nNon-GAAP selling, general and administrative reconciliation:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGAAP revenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717\nGAAP selling, general and administrative expenses $ 363,510 $ 307,784\nImpairment related to information technology systems — —\nImpairment related to distribution centers — —\nInformation technology project discontinuation — —\nHEYDUDE integration costs — (545)\nDuplicate headquarters rent (1) — (976)\nOther (2) — (1,749)\nTotal adjustments — (3,270)\nNon-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses (3) $ 363,510 $ 304,514\nGAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues 34.2 % 29.4 %\nNon-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues 34.2 % 29.1 %\n(1) Represents duplicate rent costs associated with our move to a new headquarters.\n(2) Includes various restructuring costs, as well as costs associated with the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. 26\n(3) Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses are presented gross of tax.\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Cont'd)\nNon-GAAP Income from Operations and Operating Margin Reconciliation:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGAAP revenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717\nGAAP income from operations $ 269,829 $ 273,852\nNon-GAAP gross profit adjustments (1) — 18,797\nNon-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses adjustments (2) — 3,270\nNon-GAAP income from operations $ 269,829 $ 295,919\nGAAP operating margin 25.4 % 26.2 %\nNon-GAAP operating margin 25.4 % 28.3 %\n(1) See 'Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin reconciliation' above for more details.\n(2) See 'Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues reconciliation' above for more details. 27\nAPPENDIX\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation (Cont'd)\nNon-GAAP Income Tax Expense (Benefit) and Effective Tax Rate Reconciliation:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nGAAP income from operations $ 269,829 $ 273,852\nGAAP income before income taxes 244,897 233,405\nNon-GAAP income from operations (1) $ 269,829 $ 295,919\nGAAP non-operating income (expenses):\nForeign currency losses, net (332) (1,770)\nInterest income 1,366 506\nInterest expense (26,203) (39,207)\nOther income, net 237 24\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes $ 244,897 $ 255,472\nGAAP income tax expense $ 45,096 $ 56,380\nTax effect of non-GAAP operating\nadjustments — 5,462\nImpact of intra-entity IP transfers (2) (14,165) (6,717)\nNon-GAAP income tax expense $ 30,931 $ 55,125\nGAAP effective income tax rate 18.4 % 24.2 %\nNon-GAAP effective income tax rate 12.6 % 21.6 %\n(1) See ‘Non-GAAP income from operations and operating margin reconciliation’ above for more details.\n(2) In the fourth quarter of 2023, and previously in 2021 and 2020, we made changes to our international legal structure, including an intra-entity transfer of certain intellectual property rights, primarily to align with current and 28\nfuture international operations.

The transfers resulted in a step-up in the tax basis of intellectual property rights and correlated increases in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the transferred intellectual property rights. This\nadjustment represents the current period impact of these transfers.\nOur forward-looking guidance for consolidated \"adjusted gross margin,\" “adjusted operating margin,” and “adjusted diluted earnings per share” represents non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been\nadjusted for special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such\nadjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.\nWhile we are able to estimate full year non-GAAP adjustments, we are unable to reconcile forward-looking adjusted measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure quarter-by-quarter because we are unable to predict the timing of\nthese adjustments with a reasonable degree of certainty. By their very nature, special and other non-core items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned\nevents that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures for the guidance related to the fourth quarter of 2024.\n30"

Please note this event\nis being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Erinn Murphy, Senior Vice President of Investor\nRelations and Corporate Strategy. Please go ahead.\nErinn Murphy\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to discuss Crocs, Inc. third quarter results. With me\ntoday are Andrew Rees, Chief Executive Officer, and Susan Healy, Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing their prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions, which we ask that\nyou limit to one per caller.\nBefore I begin, I would like to remind you that some of the information provided on this call is\nforward-looking, and accordingly is subject to the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities\nlaws. These statements include but are not limited to statements regarding our strategy, plans,\nobjectives, expectations and intentions, including our financial outlook.\nThese statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors which may\ncause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be differ materially. Please refer to\nour quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other reports filed with the SEC for more information on\nthese risks and uncertainties.\nCertain financial matters that we refer to as adjusted, or non-GAAP, are non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation of these amounts to their GAAP counterparts is contained in the press release\nwe issued earlier this morning. All revenue growth rates will be cited on a constant currency\nbasis unless otherwise stated.\nAt this time, I'll turn the call over to Andrew Rees, Crocs, Inc. Chief Executive Officer.\nAndrew Rees\nThank you, Erinn, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We reported\nthird quarter results that exceeded our guidance in terms of sales and profitability on an\nenterprise basis. Consolidated enterprise revenues of $1.1 billion grew 2% to prior year, led by\n5% growth in DTC.\nBy brand, Crocs brand grew 8%, with international up 17% and North America up 2%.\nHEYDUDE revenues contracted 17%, slightly below our expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS of\n$3.60 a share increased 11%.\nToday I will be covering the following topics. I will first share deeper insights into our third\nquarter results, along with what we're seeing from a broader consumer perspective. I will then\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n3\nelaborate on HEYDUDE's strategic priorities and what gives me confidence around the brand's\nlonger term growth prospects, touching on some of the early wins we're seeing in the business\ntoday. Finally, Susan will review our financial performance, our updated 2024 outlook, and our\npreliminary thoughts on 2025.\nNow turning to third quarter insights starting with the Crocs' brand, the investments we are\nmaking in product and marketing enable us to win with consumers around the world. All three of\nour product pillars, clogs, sandals, and personalization, grew during the third quarter, led by our\nicon, the classic clog. In August, Footwear News named our classic clog one of the greatest\nshoes of all time.\nEmbracing the personalization platform that our clog provides, we launched our Live Life Fully\nLoaded campaign during the back-to-school season. This campaign created high consumer\nengagement in our stores and online, both for our classic clog as well is our Jibbitz business, as\nconsumers were able to fuel their love for self-expression.\nWe're continuing to iterate on our clog by introducing new silhouettes and building durable\nfranchises. The Echo franchise, which has developed a breadth of products across clogs,\nsandals, boots, and sneakers, continues to bring in new, largely male explorer consumer to our\nbrand. As we look into spring, we're excited to bring the Echo Wave, a molded mule, and the\nEcho Surge to market. Both new innovations are priced under $100.00.\nAnother example of how we've iterated on the clog is our InMotion franchise. We have seen\nsuccessful results in our tests of this franchise on our DTC channels ahead of its scaled rollout\nin 2025. This new innovation features our proprietary LiteRide foam footbed along with our Free\nFeel technology.\nBy applying the learnings from our quick to market DTC Cozzzy Slipper launch last year, we're\nable to scale the offering this fall across expanded colorways and with our wholesale partners at\nan incredible value of $49.99. Sellout has been strong out of the gate, and we're chasing\nreplenishment.\nIn addition to our mainline product, we brought many exciting partnerships to life during the\nquarter. These included a Bath & Body Works collection featuring a classic clog and a Cozzzy\nsandal pre-Jibbited with four mystery scents Jibbitz charms. We also introduced Batman and\nSquishmallow, and of course our Crocs x McDonald's Happy Meal.\nAs a natural extension of our first collaboration with McDonald's, we designed and introduced\nthe McDonald's x Crocs Happy Meal with a curated assortment of 17 limited-edition classic clog\nkeychains and a sticker pack for personalization. We launched the Happy Meal first in China\nand saw fantastic results. Within the first 48 hours, over 400,000 Crocs Happy Meals were sold,\ngenerating over 10 billion brand impressions. Since then, we have launched a Happy Meal in\nover 40 countries, driving significant brand momentum and heat.\nLast week we celebrated the seventh annual Croc Day on October 23rd, our very own fan\ninspired holiday within the month of Croctober. With a much awaited debut, we celebrated the\nrelease of Pet Crocs available alongside matching classic line clogs, allowing dogs and dog\nparents to coordinate their looks in lockstep. Our Pet Crocs, designed in partnership with BARK,\nwere available globally on our own dot-com and in select retail stores. The release was a huge\nsuccess.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n4\nFun inspired festivities did not stop there. This year we released a Crocs costume which is in\nthe form of a life-size iconic classic clog fully loaded with Jibbitz charms. And just like your\nfavorite pair of Crocs clogs, this costume is available in both left and right versions, making a\nperfect pairing opportunity with friends.\nIn September, we achieved another step forward towards our circularity goals with the launch of\na limited edition Keep It Going classic clog. The new clogs feature 25% postconsumer recycled\ncontent from the shoes collected through our Old Crocs, New Life consumer take-back program,\nwith the remaining construction of the shoe containing up to 25% bio-based Croslite material.\nNow for a review of the Crocs brand business by geography, the North American market\nperformed well, with revenue growth of 2% versus prior year, led by DTC. In North America, the\nconsumer has reverted to pre-pandemic shopping patterns, shopping closer to need and\nconcentrating spend around key shopping events and holidays. We saw solid back-to-school\nseason, but since Labor Day we have seen the consumer pull back. We anticipate the\nconsumer environment being relatively muted in the US until Black Friday/Cyber Monday\nholiday period.\nOur overall international revenues grew 17% versus prior year, supported by notable growth in\nAustralia, China, France, and Germany. Our China business grew over 20% on top of more\nthan 90% growth last year in the third quarter, with approximately two-thirds of the growth driven\nby mono brand partner stores.\nAs we shared during our second quarter call, the industry was more promotional during the\nmidseason festival. It is clear that the Chinese consumer is being far more conservative in their\npurchase behavior, and we have seen an even more pronounced pullback within key Tier 1\ncities like Shanghai and Beijing.\nIn light of the broader macroenvironment in China, we're taking a more cautious view for the rest\nof the year. Despite this backdrop, our brand continues to gain share in China, which we believe\nis a direct result of our accessible, authentic, and personalizable brand positioning serving as a\nmeaningful competitive advantage.\nTurning to HEYDUDE, our third quarter results came in slightly below our guidance, with\nrevenues declining 17%. Before I provide further detail on the quarter, I want to start by sharing\nthe progress we've made towards building HEYDUDE into a consistent and profitable growth\nbrand.\nIn September of last year, we made a pivot to prioritize brand health, clean up channel inventory\nwhile rightsizing our account base, and began building a fleet of premium outlet stores to\nshowcase the best expression of our brand. Since then, we've elevated ASPs, shuttered more\nthan 50% of our accounts, improved inventory turns to four times a year, and opened 29\npremium outlet stores. In addition, we've invested in talent across the brand while accelerating\nour market investment as we work towards driving higher awareness and relevance to generate\nbrand heat.\nWe strongly believe these are the right decisions to build a solid foundation for profitable growth\nat HEYDUDE. While we recognize HEYDUDE's performance this year has not yet reflected\nthese investments and actions, let me share a little bit more about what has given me\nconfidence.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n5\nAs we spoke about last quarter, we've sharpened our strategy to focus on three strategic\nimperatives: driving youth female culture and creating a HEYDUDE brand community; building\nthe core, our Wally and Wendy, and adding more; then stabilize and accelerate North America.\nAgainst these imperatives, we're seeing the following green shoots.\nFirst, we believe the female youth culture is a key driver of influence, brand connectivity, and a\ncatalyst to build community. In August, we were thrilled to announce Sydney Sweeney as our\nglobal brand ambassador and our Director of Dudes. This partnership has generated the best-\nperforming content HEYDUDE has seen to date, and we have plans to ignite further content\nwith Sydney Sweeney.\nDuring the quarter, we launched TikTok Shop. And we've seen an excellent response, bringing\na new, younger consumer. In fact, on select launch days, our brand emerged as the number\none global key account on TikTok Shop. HEYDUDE's number of TikTok followers surpassed\nInstagram in the quarter, further underscoring our opportunity to reach a younger audience. We\nwere also named the official comfort shoe of Barstool Sports in time for our refreshed collegiate\ncollection.\nSecond, we are focused on our icons, the Wendy and Wally. Our three core offerings include\nStretch Sox, Stretch Canvas, Funk Mono. During the quarter, we iterated on these core\nofferings through our collaboration engine, successfully introducing Beetlejuice and SpongeBob,\nto name a few.\nIn October, we announced a long-term partnership with country music singer Jelly Roll. Our\ninitial colab with this famed artist featured our Wally Slip, which sold out in minutes. Since the\nlaunch, we've seen the product show up on the secondary platforms for up to $6,000.\nAs we discussed on our Q2 call, the COMF is a new product innovation that is an extension of\nour Wendy and Wally DNA with added cushioning and height. In the third quarter, we began\nscaling this across select global accounts. As we look beyond our core, we're seeing very\nhealthy demand signs in our women's Austin Lift and our men's pool silhouette, with plans to\nscale them in 2025.\nThird, we're hyper focused on stabilizing the North American market to drive a sustainable\nfoundation from which to grow. We've streamlined our account base and are focused on\nbuilding new relationships across our strategic retailers similar to that of Crocs. We have worked\nto improve our inventory position in-channel and improve ASPs across digital. In the third\nquarter, our digital ASPs were up 10% to last year, and we saw improving weeks of supply\nacross our key strategic accounts. Our premium outlet stores are performing in line with our\nexpectations.\nWhile we're encouraged by these early positive indicators, HEYDUDE's recent performance and\nthe current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we initially planned for\nthe business to turn the corner. We continue to have confidence about the long-term potential of\nthe brand, and the green shoots we are seeing give us positive reinforcement around our\nopportunity. I'm incredibly proud of the HEYDUDE team and the urgency with which they've\nexecuted against our sharpened strategy.\nI will now turn the call over to Susan to walk through our financials for the quarter.\nSusan Healy\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n6\nThank you, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results exceeded the high\nend of our enterprise guidance on the top and bottom line, supported by a combination of better\nunderlying operating performance, a lower than expected tax rate, and lower share count.\nFor the Crocs brand, revenues were $858 million, growing 8% to prior year, and channel growth\nwas balanced, with DTC and wholesale each growing 8%. The growth was volume driven, with\nunits increasing 11% versus last year to a total of 32.1 million pairs of shoes sold, while brand\nASPs decreased 3% to $26.48. ASPs were below last year, tied largely to product mix and\nslight price erosion.\nNorth America revenues grew 2% versus the prior year to $491 million. Growth was led by DTC,\nwhich was up 4%, while wholesale was down 2%. Underlying North American brick and mortar\ngrowth was up mid-single digits.\nInternational revenues of $367 million grew 17% versus prior year, led by DTC growth of 18%\nand wholesale growth of 15%. In China, we saw growth in excess of 20% on top of last year's\n90% plus growth rate, while our direct European markets continued to show healthy growth in\nthe quarter, led by Germany and France.\nTurning to HEYDUDE, revenues were $204 million, down 17% from last year. Wholesale\nrevenues were down 23% and DTC revenues were down 9%. While we did plan for wholesale\ndeclines in the third quarter, our guidance anticipated stabilization of DTC.\nTo support the strategies Andrew outlined earlier, we changed our investment strategy around\nperformance marketing, shifting investments towards brand marketing, which impacted our\ndigital performance negatively. We believe we are making the right decisions for the long-term\nhealth of the brand, highlighted by the continued strengthening of our ASPs, up 4% to $30.94 in\nthe quarter. Concurrently, volumes were lower, with 7 million pairs of shoes sold, 21% below\nlast year.\nConsolidated adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 59.6%, up to 220 basis points from\nlast year. Crocs brand adjusted gross margin was 62.5%, or 40 basis points higher than prior\nyear. The primary drivers of margin expansion were favorable product cost and select\ninternational price increases, offset in part by channel mix.\nHEYDUDE brand adjusted gross margin was 47.9%, or 510 basis points higher than prior year,\ndriven primarily by freight, favorable channel mix, and pricing. Overall, adjusted gross margin\nwas below expectations as the channel mix benefit was not as favorable as expected, given\nsofter than anticipated digital trends in the quarter.\nOur third quarter adjusted SG&A dollars increased 19% to prior year. Our adjusted SG&A rate\nwas 34.2%, up 510 basis points compared to prior year, driven by continued investment in\ntalent, marketing, digital and retail to support long-term market share gains.\nOur third quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.4%, down 290 basis points from 28.3% in\nthe prior year, driven by planned investments in SG&A.\nThird quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $3.60. Our non-GAAP\neffective tax rate was 12.6%. Our lower than expected tax rate was largely tied to cash tax\nsavings from the refinancing of our intercompany debt that occurred in the quarter.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n7\nOur inventory balance as of June 30th was $367 million, a decline of 6% versus this time last\nyear. Both of our brands achieved inventory turns above our goal of 4 times on an annualized\nbasis.\nOur liquidity position remains strong, comprised of $186 million of cash and cash equivalents\nand $559 million of borrowing capacity on our revolver. During the quarter, we repaid\napproximately $110 million of debt, reducing borrowings to approximately $1.4 billion. Year to\ndate, we have repaid $248 million of debt, and we ended the quarter at the lower end of our\nlong-term net leverage target range of 1 to 1.5 times.\nEnabled by our best in class free cash flow generation, we also completed $151 million of share\nbuybacks during the quarter, repurchasing 1.1 million shares at an average price of\napproximately $135.00 per share. Year to date, we have completed $326 million of share\nbuybacks, repurchasing 2.3 million shares. We currently have $549 million remaining on our\nshare repurchase authorization.\nNow turning to 2024 guidance, based on our third quarter results and the visibility we have\nheading into the fourth quarter, we are adjusting our full-year outlook. Our full-year enterprise\nrevenue growth is now approximately 3% versus 3% to 5% prior, assuming currency rates as of\nSeptember 30th.\nFor the Crocs brand, we are narrowing our revenue range from 7% to 9% growth to\napproximately 8%. For HEYDUDE, we are lowering our revenue range from down 8% to 10% to\ndown approximately 14.5% based on lower than previously assumed sellouts in both wholesale\nand digital.\nWe are maintaining our guidance for consolidated adjusted operating margins of more than 25%\nfor the year powered by our strong adjusted gross margins, which we continue to plan up to\nprior year across the enterprise.\nResulting in part from our lower than expected annual tax rate and incremental share\nrepurchase in the quarter, we are raising our 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share from\n$12.45 to $12.90 to the high-end of our prior range at $12.82 to $12.90. Consistent with our\nprevious guidance policy, this range reflects future debt repayment and does not assume any\nimpact from future share repurchases.\nWe are now expecting an underlying non-GAAP effective tax rate, which approximates cash\ntaxes paid, to be approximately 16%, and the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21%.\nWe are lowering our annual capital expenditures guidance from $100 million to $110 million to\n$90 million to $100 million tied to the cash timing of select operational projects.\nTurning to our guidance for Q4, we expect consolidated revenues to be in the range of flat to\nslightly at currency rates as of September 30th. We expect the Crocs brand to grow\napproximately 2%, led by double-digit international growth. Our fourth quarter international\ngrowth rate is below our year to date growth rate based on, one, a more cautious consumer in\nChina, and two, ongoing regulatory pressure in India which is impacting our ability to meet\ndemand.\nTurning to North America, we expect a slightly negative fourth quarter, which includes our\nexpectations of a more choiceful consumer as well is the timing of wholesale shipments\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n8\nbetween quarters. For the second half, North America is expected to be flat to prior year, in line\nwith our previous expectations. We expect Q4 DTC to remain positive.\nFor HEYDUDE, we expect revenue to be down between 4% and 6% in the quarter, below the\nformer implied range of up low to mid teens. The largest driver of our lower revenue outlook is\ntied to lower than expected sellouts on both digital and wholesale. Our assumptions around our\nnon-comp drivers, including our retail stores and our international distributor sell-ins, are in line\nwith our former forecast.\nAdjusted gross margins are expected to be up for the enterprise, with Crocs brand up slightly\nand HEYDUDE slightly down versus prior year. We expect adjusted SG&A spend to be in the\nhigh teen range in Q4, and adjusted operating margin to be approximately 19.5%. Adjusted\ndiluted earnings per share is expected to be between $2.20 to $2.28.\nWhile we are not guiding to 2025 yet, I want to provide some preliminary shaping for your\nmodels based on the visibility we have thus far. For Crocs, we expect revenue growth in 2025 to\nbe led by international. As a reminder, we will be negatively impacted by the timing of Easter\nmoving back into Q2. This will have an outsized impact to our North America region in the first\nquarter, in addition to lapping Leap Year.\nFor HEYDUDE, next year is about brand stabilization. As Andrew shared, we are seeing green\nshoots around the brand receptivity from a broadening group of consumers, but note that\nfinancial results will lag the marketing momentum we are currently seeing. With the visibility we\nhave into 2025, we expect the first quarter to be sequentially down from the fourth quarter, tied\nto wholesale.\nIn 2025, we plan to continue to invest behind talent, marketing, digital and retail in order to\ncreate sustainable long-term growth, which will put incremental pressure on our EBIT margin\nrate versus 2024.\nIn closing, we are making near-term decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest\nof the company and our shareholders, and we will continue to focus on what our company does\nbest, delivering growth with industry-leading margins that generate significant free cash flow.\nI will now turn the call back over to Andrew for his final thoughts.\nAndrew Rees\nThank you, Susan. Our company's initiatives remain consistent, and we're focused on three\nprimary levers to fuel durable long-term growth. One, ignite our icons across both brands to\ndrive awareness and global relevance for new and existing consumers; two, drive market share\ngains across our Tier 1 markets through strategic investment behind talent, marketing, digital\nand retail; and three, attract new consumers to our brands through methodically diversifying our\nproduct range and usage occasions.\nAt this time, we'll open the call for questions.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then\none on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n9\nbefore pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to\nwithdraw your question, please press star then two. We ask that you please limit yourself to one\nquestion. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nThe first question today comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Komp\nYeah, hi. Good morning. Thank you. I'll stick with one topic here. I want to ask about Crocs\nNorth America. Could you just give a little more detail? Susan, I know you mentioned a shift in\nQ4 on wholesale but expectations for D to C to remain positive. Could you just remind us of\nsome of the moving parts for D to C and what's driving the forecast?\nAnd then maybe a bigger picture question as we look forward into 2025. What role will North\nAmerica play in the total Crocs outlook for 2025, and what are some of the drivers that you see,\nAndrew?\nAndrew Rees\nGreat. So, let's do it in that order, Jonathan. Susan will kind of give you the mechanics around\nthe remainder of this year and I'll touch on the bigger picture.\nSusan Healy\nGreat. Thanks, Jon. When we think about North America, we are unchanged in our expectation\nthat North America will be flat for the second half. And we were really pleased with the\nunderlying performance in the third quarter of the Crocs brand in North America. But for the full\nback half, our expectations are unchanged.\nSo, by channel, fourth quarter DTC is expected to be positive, offset by wholesale, which is\nplanned down as retailers took product earlier in Q3 than we planned. And overall, we're mindful\nof current consumer shopping patterns as well as macro headwinds in the fourth quarter, and\nwe're taking a prudent approach.\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. So, if we step back to the big picture, so North America this year, based on all the\nguidance we provided for the fourth quarter, will grow about 2.5% for the year. And so, what role\ndoes this play within our overall business?\nSo, the North American business, as we look at it, is a well-managed, stable business. It's highly\nprofitable. It's cash generative, and it really is obviously a large business. You know the\nabsolute size of it. And so, it generates the income, the cash flow that we can use to fund--one\nis the international growth for Crocs, but also some of the investments we're making in\nHEYDUDE.\nIt's balanced across channels. So, we have a wholesale business. We have a retail business.\nWe have a digital business. We've made some strategic shifts over the past year within digital,\ngoing more to 3P on our Amazon platform. We think that's been highly productive, and we think\nthat'll be attractive in the future.\nAnd we kind of think about the business as really being very well positioned to continue the role\nthat it's playing today. We're confident that there will be--short to longer term, we'll be able to\ngrow the business modestly. And it plays a very important role in our overall portfolio.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n10\nJonathan Komp\nGreat. That's helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Rees\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJim Duffy\nThank you. Good morning. Multipart question on HEYDUDE. First, you mentioned streamlining\nthe account base for HEYDUDE. Can you elaborate on those distribution actions? And then I'm\nhoping you can speak to HEYDUDE brand operating profitability and your willingness to\ncontinue to invest against profitability to strive for brand inflection.\nAndrew Rees\nOkay. Great. So, from an account-based perspective, we really talked about this almost a year\nago now, where we cut off some of the smaller customers to really focus back on the large\nnational strategic accounts, or alliance partners as we call them, where we want to make sure\nthat we have adequate segmentation and differentiation and we can grow with a broad base of\naccounts.\nWe do keep a lot of what we--kind of smaller, more strategic, well-positioned or regional\ncustomers we think are important in terms of reaching select consumers and also giving a\nbroader consumer base some attractive points of distribution. So, that has happened probably\nalmost a year ago at this point. So, we feel really good with where we are from an account-\nbased perspective.\nIn terms of profitability, there's a couple of key drivers there as we think about the future. One is\ngross margin. You've seen us start to elevate gross margins from a low in '23 to some\nsubstantial improvements in '24. Based on some of the infrastructure investments we've made,\nbased on some pricing decisions we've made that have impacted gross margin in the past, we\nthink long-term gross margin is around 50%. We're not going to get there in the next couple of\nquarters, but that's in the midterm. We think that's a very strong place for a brand to be.\nAnd then obviously we're investing substantially in SG&A. So, we're investing at an elevated\nrate in terms of marketing. You saw a lot of the activities. We talked about them on our prepared\nremarks. I think you've seen them in the--on social media and in the press, especially in this\nquarter. We're investing in marketing to engage a younger consumer, to pivot to a more female-\norientated consumer, and also to create broader awareness for the brand.\nWe're also making SG&A investments to fuel growth both in our outlet stores that we've opened\nthis year in North America and also preparing for our international growth. So, I think what this\ntells you is that we're supremely confident in the long-term growth potential of HEYDUDE. We're\nprepared to make these investments. We're confident they will pay off. And frankly, the broader\nfinancial profile of the Crocs, Inc. business allows us to do this, and we think they're prudent\ninvestments that will pay off for shareholders in the medium to long term.\nJim Duffy\nOkay. Just to follow up on that, Andrew, in the context of valuing Crocs, Inc., many people are\nlooking at the contribution of the Crocs brand profitability and trying to isolate that for valuation\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n11\npurposes. And so, additional perspective on the HEYDUDE brand profitability would I think help\npeople get to that assessment of the size of the different profit pools.\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. I mean, I guess I would encourage our investors to look at the totality, right? So, our total\ncompany is highly profitable. It's highly cash generative. And as you kind of think about\ninvesting in the company, I would encourage people to look at the totality and look at the future\npotential of those cash flow streams and the optionality that provides us to continue to\ndeleverage and reduce risk within the company but also return cash to shareholders in a\nsustainable basis. I think that's a pretty good investment profile.\nJim Duffy\nAnd then with the outlook for HEYDUDE, have you at all tempered the SG&A investment plans?\nAndrew Rees\nI would say, no, we haven't. I'd go back to what I said sort of in my first answer. We're extremely\nconfident around the mid to long-term potential of the HEYDUDE brand. And as we analyze\neach of the investments we're making, we feel that they will provide a very strong return.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAdrienne Yih\nYes, great. Thank you very much. Andrew, you had talked about sort of the back-to-school\nseason being kind of back to the highs are high and the lows are--kind of, I guess, a choppy\nbackground. I'm wondering if you can sort of talk about how you operate in that environment,\nhow you think the retail channel partners are kind of managing through that, and if you think that\nwe're pulling up some sales for holiday.\nAnd then my last question is how long does it take for the sell-through to work through itself? Do\nyou think that you're having--well, you have the spring order book, some futures. Can you give\nus some color on that? Thank you very much.\nAndrew Rees\nYes. Yeah, I suspect you've heard others talk about this. And you're probably--as our retail\npartners report in a week or so, a month or so, you'll hear a lot more about this. But look, I do\nthink the consumer's returned to a more traditional shopping pattern. We would kind of say it's\nkind of pre-pandemic. They're going to shop when they need it. They're going to shop at key\nevents, whether they be holidays or promotional. And in some cases, they need a little extra\nincentive to transact.\nSo, I think that's what we were familiar with before we got into the sort of lack of\nsupply/oversupply components of the pandemic. I think they're back there. I think they've been\ngetting back there over the last kind of year or so. We're anticipating that into the fourth quarter.\nAnd I think our retail partners, certainly in this country, are pretty adept. I mean, they're highly\nsophisticated. They're seeing this happen. They have probably more data than we do to really\nunderstand this. So, I think they're pretty adept and they're transitioning pretty quickly, and I\nthink they'll do a good job.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n12\nAnd in terms of order books, we're pretty prudent. We try and make sure our order books are\nvery much lined up with expected sellout. We think the timing of that sellout is a little bit shifted,\nbut we kind of try to calculate the aggregate sellout. We don't want excess inventories in the\nmarket, and I think we're on top of that for Crocs.\nAs we've talked about from a HEYDUDE perspective, we have had excess inventories in the\nmarket, and we've been aggressively trying to work those down this year. And we've made good\nprogress, but frankly not quite all the progress we want to make.\nAdrienne Yih\nGreat. Thank you very much, and best of luck.\nAndrew Rees\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Chris Nardone with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChris Nardone\nThank you, guys. Good morning. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on your confidence in\ngrowing your Crocs North America direct-to-consumer business in the fourth quarter maybe\nbased on what you're seeing quarter to date?\nThen switching your Amazon business to a 3P model, I think you've fully lapped that now. Can\nyou just elaborate on the rationale around doing that and just how you view your Amazon\nbusiness relative to, like, your crocs.com business? Thank you.\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. I would say that's a hard question to answer, Chris. So, look, I think all the plans that\nwe've put in place for our Crocs North America DTC business, we feel great about, right? We\nfeel great about the product lineup. We feel great about our holiday planning. We feel great\nabout our backend logistics, etc. But growing that business and comping is based on all those\nthings going well, and so--and our product lineup on marketing. So, we feel really good about it.\nI would say that's a combination of obviously our stores, which are predominantly premium\noutlet stores. It's a combination of our dot-com business and also our Marketplace business.\nAnd so, we feel really good about it. And fingers crossed, everything will play out how we think\nit's going to play out, but there is obviously some uncertainty there. And I would also say we\nkind of try to plan it prudently as well. We've got backup plans for if things don't go 100% to our\nexpectations.\nBig picture on Amazon, I would say, look, Amazon's a super important customer. We're a broad\ndemocratic brand. We want to reach our consumers where they are. They're clearly on Amazon.\nThey start a lot of their shopping on Amazon, their initial searches on Amazon when they're\nlooking for a pair of Crocs, but also many other things.\nAnd from participating on that very important marketplace, both here in North America and other\nparts around the world, we think this is an opportunity for us to have more emphasis on our\nbrand, a little bit better control of the products that we bring to market, etc. And so, we're liking\nthe transition. We think it's productive, and I think the consumer is enjoying it, too.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n13\nChris Nardone\nThank, Andrew. And just one quick follow-up on the operating margin outlook. I think you\nmentioned it should be a little bit lower next year. Just wanted to hear your rationale about\nbalancing investment spend to grow both of these brands for the long term, but also trying to\nmaintain an operating margin around the mid 20% range and close to your longer term 26%\nplus target.\nSusan Healy\nYeah. So, I can take that one. This is--we're really planning on continuing to invest. We see\nrevenue generating opportunities for both brands. And we look, as Andrew said, very disciplined\nabout what we see the return on investment. And when we see these opportunities, we're\ninvesting.\n2024 has been an investment year. We're very early in the planning process for next year, but\nwe're going to continue to invest behind talent, marketing, digital and retail. And as we said,\nthat's going to put incremental pressure on our EBIT margin rate versus 2024. And we'll give\nyou more guidance about 2025 on our fourth quarter call.\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. And I would say big picture, Chris, look, I would say mid 20s. I think we'll be above 25%\naccording to our guidance for this year. We've been significantly above that in recent years.\nThese are extraordinary levels of profitability. If you look at our competitive base, there are very\nfew players that come close. Nobody is above. So, we've got to balance maintaining high levels\nof profitability and cash flow generation, which obviously underpin our overall valuation, with\nactually investing in attractive mid to long-term growth opportunities. And we'll toggle backwards\nand forwards between those.\nChris Nardone\nThank you. Good luck.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\nBob Drbul\nHi. Good morning. Two questions, actually. The first one is can you talk about the change in the\ninvestment marketing strategy for HEYDUDE in the quarter and what KPIs you are seeing? And\nthe second question is can you just clarify, for Crocs for North America, do you expect growth in\nNorth America market for 2025?\nAndrew Rees\nOkay, two different questions. So, the first one actually is a super important question, Bob. Glad\nyou asked it. So, one of the key decisions that we made in the third quarter is we pulled back on\nperformance marketing for the HEYDUDE brand.\nAs we've looked at the sort of multiyear trajectory, our level of performance marketing had been\ncreeping up. I would say the marginal ROI was still positive, but they were not where we wanted\nthem to be, and we wanted to push more of a marketing investment into the brand and into the\nlong-term future of the brand. So, we made a pretty distinct pullback in performance marketing.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n14\nSo, that's ad dollars, Google Search, or all of those kind of things that you can spend money on\na short-term basis. You can measure the returns, but if your marginal return dips to a level that\nyou don't really feel comfortable with--so we pulled back on that and then we used that money\nto fund Sydney Sweeny, Jelly Roll, Barstool Sports, some of the TikTok activations that we've\nbeen doing, starting up the TikTok Shop. And we think that will be much more attractive from a\nbrand return and investment perspective over the long term.\nThat has had a short-term impact, and it's probably the biggest explanator for our miss in Q3\nfrom a HEYDUDE revenue perspective, and also the biggest explanator for the reduction in the\nQ4 guide for HEYDUDE. That's the biggest dollar change, and we think it's the right thing to do\nin the long term.\nAnd then your question on Crocs I think was a clarification on North American--yeah, we think\nwe will grow modestly slightly for North America Crocs in 2025. That is our current plan. But I\nwould say the real value creator and the value driver for Crocs is the international growth.\nYou've seen that come through for the last two years, and we are very confident that will\ncontinue into 2025.\nBob Drbul\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Rick Patel with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Rick, your\nline is now open. You may ask your question.\nRick Patel\nHi. Sorry about that. Thank you. Good morning. I was hoping you can expand upon what you\njust ended with in terms of Crocs' international growth potential in 2025. So, given the slowdown\nthat you're seeing in China that you expect to continue, how should we think about the building\nblocks of growth next year, and which market you have the most confidence in to do the heavy\nlifting?\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. So, thank you, Rick. So, what I would say is we've definitely seen a slowdown in China.\nBut I would point out we are still growing in China, and we still intend to grow in China next year,\nright? So, it's not the 80%, 90% growth that we saw in '23. We grew 20 plus percent growth in\nQ2--sorry, Q3 that we just reported. But we do intend to continue to grow in China really\nunderpinned by a lot of the mono brand store openings that we've done in China.\nSo, we've grown our digital business successfully. We've opened some select retail stores we\noperate ourselves, and we also work with a range of brand partners who opened mono brand\nstores. I think we've opened--by the end of the year, we'll have close to 400 mono-brand stores,\nand we've opened in excess of 150 stores year to date. Obviously, as those have grown--\nopened through the year, that will provide growth for next year, as well as, we think, our\npositioning in the marketplace, our accessible price points, personalization, comfort, etc., is\ngoing to be a competitive positioning. So, we will grow in China.\nIn addition to China, I think we're confident around India. We have, I think, a very attractive\nbusiness model in India that has been impeded recently with the BIS, if everybody knows what\nthat is. That's the Indian government's been imposing some restrictions associated with you\nneed to make your product in India. We will have production up and running for both Crocs and\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n15\nHEYDUDE in India next year. It started this year, but it will reach its--reach enough supply to\nfund market next year. So, we're confident about India.\nWe've talked quite a bit about how our key direct markets in Western Europe continue to be\nsuccessful, Germany and France. We anticipate that continuing. So, those are some of the key\ndrivers. We've had great success in Australia for the last couple of years. We see that as\nprobably a little bit more stable for the next couple of years. But that's, obviously, attractive\nbusiness, as is South Korea.\nI would say, to be frank, Japan remains a work in progress. We're focused on kind of resetting\nthe business and focusing on the classic clog and personalization in that market. We've\nevidence that is starting to get traction. But that obviously is a very big market with big long-term\npotential. So, I think there are plenty of growth engines to support our international aspirations\nfrom a Crocs perspective.\nRick Patel\nThank you very much.\nAndrew Rees\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Sam Poser with Williams Trading. Please go ahead.\nSam Poser\nGood morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, can we talk about HEYDUDE? And, I\nmean, Andrew, you reiterate your confidence in it. I guess my question is what--how did this all\nevolve, and what happened different than what you thought was going to happen that was\nunder your control that you have to fix? And how long--and what are--what specifically, other\nthan switching marketing and cleaning up, are you doing to sort of start driving sales again?\nIt looks to me like you have some good stuff going on as far as partners and so on, but the\nconsumer is not responding. And that's not--let's take macro out of the picture. Let's say what's\nunder your control.\nAndrew Rees\nOkay. So, let me start with the last part of your question. Then we can go back to the first part\nand you can kind of just clarify it. So, the last part, I think, is you're kind of getting at what are we\ndoing, why do we think that will help the situation, if you like. So, the things that we're doing are\nmultipronged, right?\nSo, one is marketing, which you highlighted. So, I think a pretty significant pivot in the marketing\nagenda to engage a broader set of consumers, drive brand awareness, drive brand relevance,\npivot towards a younger female consumer, which drives culture in this country, certainly. And we\nthink culture in this country drives culture and resonance in other countries around the world.\nThat's very, very important. And I think you talked about that, or you mentioned that.\nSecond is, I would say, wholesale management. So, that is reducing in-market inventories,\nworking proactively with all of our alliance partners to make sure they have the right product at\nthe right time. They have adequate differentiation. And I think we're making some good strides\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n16\nthere, but there is still work to be done. So, I think there's more work to be done, but we're doing\nthe right things, and they will pay off in the longer term.\nNumber three is building, I would say, complementary channels of distribution. Premium outlet\nstores, we've opened chain of premium outlet stores, I think about 29 year to date for the end of\nSeptember. We'll open another 11 in the fourth quarter. They are performing well. That is a very\nattractive investment from our perspective, and it allows the consumers that are in those centers\nto see the breadth of the brand. We see a much better balance in those environments between\nWally and Wendy, between male and female. We also have a kids business in those\nenvironments. So, we think that's a very valuable consumer exposure mechanism.\nThird thing is laying the groundwork for international growth. We opened up four direct markets,\ntwo in the quarter. So, as you might remember, we're now present in the U.K., in Germany,\nIndia, and Australia as direct markets. They are all small. And when I say present in direct\nmarket, that means we have wholesale distribution. We have a digital presence. We don't have\nany retail presence in those markets, just too small at this stage.\nBut I would say what we're seeing, while the numbers are small and we expected them to be\nsmall, is a relatively positive reception from those consumers. And that's a pretty diverse set of\nconsumers, from the U.K. to Germany to India to Australia. In addition, the international\nbusiness in Spain and Italy continues to perform well through a distributor. And we have a range\nof incremental distributors that we will ship, in Q4 and Q1, essentially their opening orders, so\nthey'll be starting up the business. So, I would say it's the marketing, but it's building all the\nplatforms that will enable future growth in the future--well, growth in the future.\nAll right. And then let's come back to what were you getting at the beginning of your question.\nSam Poser\nWell, I mean, I wrote about this a long time ago. At the end of fiscal '20--end of calendar '22, in\nthe beginning of '23, you shifted a ton of product into the marketplace. So, I guess the question\nis, is how overstated were the sales last year and what's the right starting point to think about,\nand how much of just filling shelf space, doing the things you did back then sort of caused what\nhappened now? And should you have taken sort of a more measured growth approach and\nmaybe you would be ahead of where you are today?\nAnd what decisions were made that your--what decisions were made that caused this? And\nthen I know you're confident, but you just lowered numbers. And I don't know what next--we'll\nsee what happens next year. But I just want to get a little more meat on the bone as to what\nhappened that was in your control versus not.\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. I think you kind of said some of it. We definitely grew too fast, right? So, out of the gate\nwhen we bought the brand, nobody knew how high was up. We didn't know how high was up\nand our customers didn't either, right? So, they were constantly out of stocking. They wanted\nmore product. We shipped more product. And I think if you think about this sort of '22 into '23\ntime frame, in retrospect we absolutely shipped too much product. So, if you're kind of asking\nwhat decisions we made that were wrong, that was wrong, that was wrong, right?\nAnd then the other thing I think that we did not do well is the initial marketing activities were\nineffective. We spent money, but they were ineffective. They were not sufficiently effective. They\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n17\nweren't focused at the right consumer, and they weren't creating the kind of resonance and\nimpact that we wanted.\nI think the third thing is the process of integrating the brand and putting in place all of the\ninfrastructure, whether that be DCs, whether that be systems and capabilities, because it came\nwith very little of that. We knew that, but that took us time. Probably took us a little bit longer\nthan we'd hoped. And that delayed some of the, I would say, offensive investments that we're\nnow making around stores and international. So, that's taken longer than we thought.\nNow, that being said, we bought a business that was approximately $600 million in revenue,\nand it is now high $800s, almost $900 million--sorry, $800-ish million in revenue. So, it's\nsubstantially bigger. It is less profitable on an EBIT percentage perspective because we've\ninvested for what we think is the longer-term growth potential. But it has been profitable all\nalong. It's been accretive along and has generated cash, and we've paid down the debt\nassociated with the investment, or paid down a lot of the debt associated with the investment.\nSo, it has not gone. if that's what you're kind of trying to get at, as we would have hoped and\nexpected, but that doesn't change our confidence around the future. The team that we have in\nplace, the strategies and activities that we have deployed, and our willingness to support those,\nthat team, those strategies and activities. So, I just want to make sure we're super clear about\nthat. That is what we're going to do, and we're very confident that will be a positive outcome for\ninvestors.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jay Sole with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJay Sole\nGreat. Thank you so much. Andrew, if we could just talk about the Crocs brand sort of big\npicture, obviously talking about a little bit of growth in North America next year. But beyond that,\nwhat's the plan to drive growth? I mean, do you see an opportunity to raise brand awareness?\nAre there new wholesale doors you get into? I mean, can you open up more maybe of your own\nstores and your direct-to-consumer channel, new categories you can get into or market share\ngains in existing categories? Just tell us how growth should trend big picture, and why maybe\nwe'll see growth accelerate beyond sort of--in North America beyond whatever rate you expect\nto get in 2025.\nAndrew Rees\nYeah. That's a great question, Jay. I would say, look, in the very short term, sort of the one to\ntwo year time frame, the primary growth driver for Crocs will be the international business, right?\nI just want to make sure I reiterate that. And that's a big and attractive business, right? And the\nunderlying strategic issue there is that our penetration in those large international markets is a\nfraction what it is here in the US, okay?\nBut that's not your question. Your question is what drives growth in North America. I don't think\nthere is a huge amount of distribution growth. I think we are the places we want to be. There are\nother places we could go. There are mass resellers that we're not represented in. I just don't\nthink that's the right place for our brand, as we want to continue to maintain a democratic but\nelevated positioning for our brand. So, I don't think we're going to go there.\nWe do think there is continued digital growth and development as the consumer goes more and\nmore digital. We do think there is growth in personalization. We think there's growth in sandals.\nCrocs, Inc. Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\nOctober 29, 2024, 8:30 A.M. Eastern\n18\nWe had a nice sandal growth here in North America in '24. We think that continues into '25 and\nhas long-range potential.\nAnd we do think there's an opportunity for us to play in a broader set of, I would say, silhouette,\nso wearing occasions. You have seen us experiment there. We will continue to experiment\nthere. But I wouldn't say we today have a slam-dunk winner in that arena, but we think we can\nget there over time.\nSo, for the sort of 12 to 24-month time frame, we're really thinking about North America as that\ncash cow funding that international growth while we can continue to experiment and engage our\nconsumers in incremental growth opportunities from a silhouette and product perspective.\nJay Sole\nGot it. That's very helpful. Andrew, thank you.\nAndrew Rees\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Anna Andreeva with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAnna Andreeva\nGreat. Thank so much and good morning. We wanted to follow up just on the overall profitability\nof the business given investments at HEYDUDE. Can you guys talk about what guardrails do\nyou have in place at the consolidated level to offset some of these investments? Andrew, I think\nyou mentioned 25% is the right level for the business. Are there additional opportunities at the\nCrocs side of things either with pricing or maybe OpEx management as we think about next\nyear? Thanks so much.\nSusan Healy\nThanks for the question, Anna. This is Susan. One thing I think it's really important to\nemphasize here is how disciplined we are about our investments. We've mentioned increasing\nour SG&A, which we continue to plan to do into next year. But there's a lot--you mentioned\nguardrails and KPIs. There's a lot of scrutiny around making sure we're making the right\ninvestments.\nAnd as Andrew indicated in talking about HEYDUDE, when we find that we need to pivot, we do\nthat pretty readily and pretty nimbly, as we did with the marketing investment on HEYDUDE,\npivoting from performance to brand when we saw a better opportunity there. So, we're super\ndisciplined about it.\nBut when we said we're--2024 is an investment year and 2025 will continue to be an investment\nyear, that will create incremental EBIT margin pressure. So, the 25% guidance that Andrew\nreiterated was for this year, and next year's we would expect to be below that.\nAnna Andreeva\nOkay. Appreciate it. Best of luck.\nOperator\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over\nto Andrew Rees, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks.\nCrocs, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nUnless otherwise noted in this report, any description of the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” includes Crocs, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries within\nour reportable operating segments and corporate operations. We are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of\ncasual lifestyle footwear and accessories for all. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of casual footwear characterized by functionality, comfort,\ncolor, and lightweight design.\nOur reportable operating segments include: (i) the Crocs Brand and (ii) the HEYDUDE Brand. See Note 13 — Operating Segments and Geographic\nInformation for additional information.\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and\nreflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Such unaudited condensed consolidated interim\nfinancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP\nhave been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial\nstatements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023 (“Annual Report”) and have been prepared on a consistent basis with the accounting policies described in Note 1 of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report. Our accounting policies did not change during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024, other than with respect to the new accounting pronouncements adopted, as applicable, as described in Note 2 — Recent Accounting\nPronouncements.\nReclassifications\nWe have reclassified certain amounts in Note 3 — Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, Note 9 — Revenues, and Note 13 — Operating Segments and\nGeographic Information to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nU.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used to\ndetermine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. Management\nbelieves that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful\naccounts, customer rebates, sales returns and allowances, impairment assessments and charges, recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets,\nvaluation allowances, uncertain tax positions, income tax expense, share-based compensation expense, the assessment of lower of cost or net realizable\nvalue on inventory, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reasonable based on information available\nat the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our condensed consolidated financial statements\nmay be materially affected.\n7\nTable of Contents\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows - Supplemental Disclosures\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash paid for interest $ 86,042 $ 125,130\nCash paid for income taxes 95,185 141,393\nCash paid for operating leases 65,754 53,679\nNon-Cash Investing and Financing Activities:\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities, net of terminations $ 75,843 $ 122,534\nAccrued purchases of property, equipment, and software 5,693 9,445\n2. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNew Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet Adopted\nPillar Two Global Minimum Tax\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has released Pillar Two model rules introducing a 15% global minimum tax\nrate for large multinational corporations to be effective starting with tax periods ending in 2024. Various jurisdictions we operate in have enacted or plan to\nenact legislation beginning in 2024 or in subsequent years. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two rules as the OECD continues to release\nguidance and modifications to the rules. We do not anticipate the Pillar Two rules will have a material impact on our 2024 consolidated financial\nstatements.\nIncome Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance related to the disclosure of rate reconciliation and\nincome taxes paid. This guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted and should be\napplied on a prospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but it will require\nincreased disclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the segment disclosures. This guidance becomes effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied on a\nretrospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but it will require increased\ndisclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after September 30, 2024 are not expected to have a material impact on our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements.\n8\nTable of Contents\n3.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nAll of our derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are reported in the condensed consolidated balance sheets within\neither ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The fair values of our\nderivative instruments were an insignificant asset and insignificant liability at September 30, 2024 and an insignificant asset and insignificant liability at\nDecember 31, 2023. See Note 6 — Derivative Financial Instruments for more information.\nThe carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, current accrued expenses and other\nliabilities, and our Citibank Facility (as defined below) approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nOur borrowing instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair\nvalues. The Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) and the Notes (as defined below) are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and are reported\nin our condensed consolidated balance sheet at face value, less unamortized issuance costs. The fair value of our Revolving Facility (as defined below)\napproximates its carrying value at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 based on interest rates currently available to us for similar borrowings. The\ncarrying value and fair value of our borrowing instruments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nTerm Loan B Facility $ 575,000 $ 578,234 $ 820,000 $ 824,100\n2029 Notes 350,000 330,538 350,000 313,987\n2031 Notes 350,000 318,343 350,000 296,742\nRevolving Facility 190,000 190,000 190,000 190,000\nNon-Financial Assets and Liabilities\nOur non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to\nbe carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe fair values of these assets are determined, as required, based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash\nflows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management’s plans. We recorded impairments within ‘Selling, general and\nadministrative expenses’ in our condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nInformation technology systems impairment\n(1) $ — $ — $ 18,172 $ —\nRight-of-use assets impairment (2) — — 5,909 —\nTotal asset impairments $ — $ — $ 24,081 $ —\n(1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an impairment charge for information technology systems related to the HEYDUDE integration of\n$17.4 million to prepaid assets and $0.8 million to intangible assets.\n(2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an impairment of $5.5 million for our former HEYDUDE Brand warehouses in Las Vegas, Nevada\nand $0.4 million for our former Crocs Brand warehouse in Oudenbosch, the Netherlands.\n6. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe transact business in various foreign entities and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that impacts the reported U.S. Dollar\n(“USD”) amounts of revenues, expenses, and certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in\nforeign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may enter into forward contracts to buy and\nsell foreign currency. By policy, we do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation.\nCounterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts we enter into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated\nfinancial institutions. We were not required to and did not post collateral as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nOur derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheets within either ‘Prepaid\nexpenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The accounting for changes in the\nfair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and\napply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and\nqualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow\nhedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of\nthe changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged\ntransactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain components of its risk, even\nthough hedge accounting does not apply, or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nWe report derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. For the condensed consolidated\nstatements of cash flows, we classify cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged\nitems within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.’\nAs of September 30, 2024, we have derivatives not designated as hedging instruments (“non-hedged derivatives”), which consist of foreign currency\nforward contracts primarily used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. For our non-hedged derivatives,\nchanges in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency losses, net’ in the condensed consolidated statements of income.\nWe also have cash flow hedges (“hedged derivatives”) as of September 30, 2024. We are exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against our\nfunctional currency, the U.S. Dollar. Specifically, we have subsidiaries that transact in currencies other than their functional currency. We use cash flow\nhedges to minimize the variability in cash flows caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our external sales and external\npurchases of inventory. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the exchange rates for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a\nspecified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in USD for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. We may also use\ncurrency option contracts under which we will pay a premium for the right to sell a specified amount of a foreign currency prior to the maturity date of the\noption.\n11\nTable of Contents\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in ‘Accumulated\nother comprehensive loss’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings, the related\ngain or loss is subsequently reclassified to ‘Revenues’ or ‘Cost of sales’ in the condensed consolidated statements of income, which is consistent with the\nnature of the hedged transaction.

Since\nthat time, we have amended the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility of $750.0 million, which can be\nincreased by an additional $250.0 million subject to certain conditions (the “Revolving Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at\na variable interest rate based on (A) a Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus\n0.25%, (ii) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) the Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 1.00%), plus\nan applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.875% based on our leverage ratio or 1.35% to 1.975% for the Daily Simple SOFR based on the leverage\nratio, or (B) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.35% to 1.975% based on our leverage\nratio for one-month interest periods and 1.40% to 2.025% based on our leverage ratio for three month interest periods. Borrowings under the Credit\nAgreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers.\nThe Credit Agreement requires or required, as applicable, us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio\nof (i) 4.00 to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2022 through, and including, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (ii) 3.75 to 1.00 for the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, (iii) 3.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and (iv) 3.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter\n(subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits, among other things, (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions,\nincluding after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii) certain acquisitions so long as\nthere is borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial\ncovenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Revolving Facility were $750.0 million. At September 30, 2024, we\nhad $190.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $0.8 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility, which reduces amounts\navailable for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $559.2 million and $558.7 million,\nrespectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, which matures in November 2027.\n14\nTable of Contents\nTerm Loan B Facility\nOn February 17, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A., as\nadministrative agent and lender, to among other things, finance a portion of the cash consideration for the HEYDUDE acquisition, which was amended on\nAugust 8, 2023 (the “August 2023 Amendment”) and on February 13, 2024 (the “February 2024 Amendment”). The Original Term Loan B Credit\nAgreement, as amended by the August 2023 Amendment and the February 2024 Amendment is referred to herein as the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement.”\nThe Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement provided for an aggregate term loan B facility in the principal amount of $2.0 billion. Prior to the February\n2024 Amendment, the outstanding balance was $820.0 million. Among other things, the February 2024 Amendment provided for a new $820.0 million\ntranche of term loans (the “2024 Refinancing Term Loans” and, such facility, the \"Term Loan B Facility\"), to refinance the then-outstanding principal\nbalance. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each subsidiary guarantor’s assets on a pari passu basis\nwith their obligations arising from the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and is scheduled to mature on February 17, 2029, subject to certain exceptions set\nforth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, satisfying certain leverage ratios, the\nCompany may, at any time, on one or more occasions, add one or more new classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the loans of\nany existing class by requesting one or more incremental term facilities.\nPursuant to the reduced interest rate margins applicable to the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans, each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate\nborrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement), plus 1.25%. Each term\nloan borrowing which is a term SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B\nCredit Agreement) plus 2.25%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility was fully drawn with no remaining borrowing capacity, and we had $575.0 million in outstanding\nprincipal on the Term Loan B Facility, which matures on February 17, 2029.\nThe Term Loan B Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, incurrence financial covenants, representations and\nwarranties, events of default and other provisions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan B\nCredit Agreement.\nAsia Revolving Credit Facility\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had one revolving credit facility in Asia with Citibank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch\n(the “Citibank Facility”), which, as amended, provides up to an equivalent of $15.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the Citibank Facility.

Interest on each of the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (collectively, the “Notes”) is\npayable semi-annually.\nThe Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after March\n15, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and\nunpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company also had the option to redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time\nbefore March 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid\ninterest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before March 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to 40% of\nthe aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes at a redemption price of 104.250% of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity\nissuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\n15\nTable of Contents\nThe Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2031 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after\nAugust 15, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

The Notes are\nunconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company’s restricted subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement and by each of the\nCompany’s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantees any debt of the Company or any guarantor under any syndicated credit facility or capital\nmarkets debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25.0 million.\nThe Indentures contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue\ncertain preferred stock; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments; declare or pay dividends or other\npayments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with the Company’s affiliates; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Notes.\n8.

The effective tax\nrate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.4% compared to an effective tax rate of 24.2% for the same period in 2023, a 5.8% decrease.\nThis decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of the Company's domestic and foreign earnings. Our effective income tax\nrate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. We had unrecognized tax benefits of $560.6 million and $556.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and we\ndo not expect any significant changes in tax benefits in the next twelve months.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense decreased $9.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.0% compared to an effective tax rate of 23.3% for the same period in 2023, a 2.3% decrease. This\ndecrease in the effective rate was primarily driven by a shift in the\n17\nTable of Contents\nmix of the Company’s domestic and foreign earnings. Our effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory\nrate due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\n11.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had purchase commitments to third-party manufacturers, primarily for materials and supplies used in the manufacture of our\nproducts, for an aggregate of $254.5 million. We expect to fulfill our commitments under these agreements in the normal course of business, and as such,\nno liability has been recorded.\nOther\nWe are regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by various tax authorities in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions, including\ncustoms duties, import, and other taxes for prior tax years.\nDuring our normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which we may be required to make\npayments. We cannot determine a range of estimated future payments and have not recorded any liability for indemnities, commitments, and guarantees in\nthe accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nWe are also subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property, and product liability\nclaims. We are not party to any significant pending legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably have a material adverse impact on our business,\nfinancial results, and cash flows. For all legal claims and disputes, we have accrued estimated losses of $2.6 million within ‘Accrued expenses and other\nliabilities’ in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. As we are able, we estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of\nreasonably possible losses. As of September 30, 2024, we estimated that reasonably possible losses associated with these legal claims and other disputes\ncould potentially exceed amounts accrued by an insignificant amount.\n18\nTable of Contents\n13. OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nWe have two reportable operating segments: the Crocs Brand and the HEYDUDE Brand. Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues\nfrom the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers.\nAdditionally, ‘Enterprise corporate’ costs include global corporate costs associated with both brands, including legal, information technology, human\nresources, and finance.\nEach segment’s performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating Enterprise corporate expenses. Segment profits or losses include\nadjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of\nunallocated enterprise corporate expenses.\nWe do not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate performance or allocate resources between segments.\nThe following tables set forth information related to reportable operating segments:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenues:\nCrocs Brand (1) $ 858,098 $ 798,769 $ 2,515,903 $ 2,280,497\nHEYDUDE Brand 204,102 246,948 596,432 721,753\nTotal consolidated revenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717 $ 3,112,335 $ 3,002,250\nIncome from operations:\nCrocs Brand (1)(2) $ 313,264 $ 297,456 $ 932,921 $ 833,145\nHEYDUDE Brand (2) 26,191 31,776 108,704 173,905\nTotal segment income from operations $ 339,455 $ 329,232 $ 1,041,625 $ 1,007,050\nReconciliation of total segment income from\noperations to income before income taxes:\nEnterprise corporate (2) (69,626) (55,380) (219,629) (179,781)\nIncome from operations 269,829 273,852 821,996 827,269\nForeign currency losses, net (332) (1,770) (3,928) (1,622)\nInterest income 1,366 506 2,908 1,225\nInterest expense (26,203) (39,207) (85,927) (124,907)\nOther income, net 237 24 302 448\nIncome before income taxes $ 244,897 $ 233,405 $ 735,351 $ 702,413\nDepreciation and amortization:\nCrocs Brand (1) $ 9,066 $ 8,692 $ 26,463 $ 23,228\nHEYDUDE Brand 5,032 3,919 13,790 10,987\nEnterprise corporate 4,087 2,140 11,637 6,316\nTotal consolidated depreciation and\namortization $ 18,185 $ 14,751 $ 51,890 $ 40,531\n(1) Our business has continued to evolve in the period following the consummation of the HEYDUDE acquisition, as we have grown the brand and staffed and developed\nour leadership team at HEYDUDE. In the fourth quarter of 2023, to reflect changes in the way management evaluates performance, makes operating decisions, and\nallocates resources, we updated our reportable operating segments to be (i) Crocs Brand and (ii) HEYDUDE Brand. Our ‘North America,’ ‘Asia Pacific,’ and\n‘EMEALA’ segments as well as revenues and expenses related to Crocs ‘Brand corporate’ have been consolidated to the ‘Crocs Brand.’ As a result of these changes,\nthe previously reported amounts for revenues, income from operations, and depreciation and amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023\nhave been recast to conform to current period presentation.\n19\nTable of Contents\n(2) In the first quarter of 2024, to reflect a change in the way management evaluates segment performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we made\nchanges to segment profitability related to certain foreign currency amounts impacting cost of sales. These amounts have shifted costs or benefits that were previously\npresented in each of our reportable segments to ‘Enterprise corporate.’ We believe that the impact of these changes on prior periods is insignificant to each segment and\nthus have not recast prior periods.\n20\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Overview\nCrocs, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide\nmarketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for all. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear for\nwomen, men, and children, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want.\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends will continue to impact our\noperating results:\n• We continue to operate in an environment where consumers are feeling the effects of elevated interest rates and inflation, and as a result, they are\nspending more cautiously. In addition, geopolitical tensions have increased across the globe. We remain focused on making the right decisions for\nthe health of our brands, maintaining tight inventory control, and investing in strategic initiatives to support durable long-term growth.\n• We continue to invest in our strategic pillars, including marketing globally for both brands, China and sandal market penetration for the Crocs\nBrand, product innovation, and various initiatives supporting our global digital business. Specific to the HEYDUDE Brand, we are focused on\nbuilding a consistent and profitable growth brand. We continue to invest in marketing and talent in order to increase awareness and relevance.\n• Our liquidity position remains strong with approximately $186.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $574.2 million in available borrowing\ncapacity as of September 30, 2024. Our total borrowings were $1.42 billion as of September 30, 2024. We repurchased $151.2 million of our\ncommon stock during the quarter.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we\npresent certain information related to our results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed\nas a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results\nthat have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business\ntrends, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on reported amounts.\nManagement uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board,\nstockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our\ncondensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance and trends. Investors should not consider constant\ncurrency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Highlights\nRevenues were $1,062.2 million for the third quarter of 2024, a 1.6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increase was due to the net\neffects of: (i) higher unit sales volume in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by lower unit sales volume in the HEYDUDE Brand, which resulted in a net\nincrease in revenues of $33.1 million, or 3.2%; (ii) lower average selling price on a constant currency basis (“ASP”) in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by\nhigher ASP in the HEYDUDE Brand, which decreased revenues by $12.9 million, or 1.2%; and (iii) net unfavorable changes in exchange rates, which\ndecreased revenues by $3.7 million, or 0.4%.\nThe following were significant developments affecting our businesses and capital structure during the three months ended September 30, 2024:\n• We grew revenues in the Crocs Brand by 7.4% compared to the same period in 2023.\n• Gross margin was 59.6%, an increase of 400 basis points from last year’s third quarter. This was primarily due to prior year distribution costs\nassociated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, lower product costs,\nfavorable brand mix, and lower freight costs.\n21\nTable of Contents\n• Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $363.5 million compared to $307.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, as a result of\ncontinued increased investment in talent and marketing. As a percent of revenues, SG&A increased to 34.2% of revenues compared to 29.4% of\nrevenues in the third quarter of 2023.\n• Income from operations decreased to $269.8 million from $273.9 million in last year’s third quarter. Net income was $199.8 million, or $3.36 per\ndiluted share, compared to $177.0 million, or $2.87 per diluted share, in last year’s third quarter.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September Nine Months Ended September % Change\n30, 30, Favorable (Unfavorable)\nYTD 2024-\n2024 2023 2024 2023 Q3 2024-2023 2023\n(in thousands, except per share, margin, and average selling price data)\nRevenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717 $ 3,112,335 $ 3,002,250 1.6 % 3.7 %\nCost of sales 428,861 464,081 1,275,003 1,322,937 7.6 % 3.6 %\nGross profit 633,339 581,636 1,837,332 1,679,313 8.9 % 9.4 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 363,510 307,784 1,015,336 852,044 (18.1)% (19.2)%\nIncome from operations 269,829 273,852 821,996 827,269 (1.5)% (0.6)%\nForeign currency losses, net (332) (1,770) (3,928) (1,622) 81.2 % (142.2)%\nInterest income 1,366 506 2,908 0 1,225 170.0 % 137.4 %\nInterest expense (26,203) (39,207) (85,927) (124,907) 33.2 % 31.2 %\nOther income, net 237 24 302 448 887.5 % (32.6)%\nIncome before income taxes 244,897 233,405 735,351 702,413 4.9 % 4.7 %\nIncome tax expense 45,096 56,380 154,189 163,433 20.0 % 5.7 %\nNet income $ 199,801 $ 177,025 $ 581,162 $ 538,980 12.9 % 7.8 %\nNet income per common share:\nBasic $ 3.38 $ 2.90 $ 9.69 $ 8.74 16.6 % 10.9 %\nDiluted $ 3.36 $ 2.87 $ 9.62 $ 8.65 17.1 % 11.2 %\nGross margin (1) 59.6 % 55.6 % 59.0 % 55.9 % 400 bp 310 bp\nOperating margin (1) 25.4 % 26.2 % 26.4 % 27.6 % (80)bp (120)bp\nFootwear unit sales:\nCrocs Brand 32,072 29,001 98,491 92,628 10.6 % 6.3 %\nHEYDUDE Brand 6,585 8,321 20,019 25,541 (20.9)% (21.6)%\nAverage footwear selling price - nominal basis (2):\nCrocs Brand $ 26.48 $ 27.25 $ 25.30 $ 24.38 (2.8)% 3.8 %\nHEYDUDE Brand $ 30.94 $ 29.68 $ 29.77 $ 28.26 4.2 % 5.3 %\n(1) Changes for gross margin and operating margin are shown in basis points (“bp”).\n(2) Average footwear selling price is calculated as footwear and charms revenues divided by footwear units, as applicable.\n22\nTable of Contents\nRevenues By Channel\nConstant Currency %\n% Change Change (1)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, Favorable (Unfavorable)\nYTD 2024- YTD 2024-\n2024 2023 2024 2023 Q3 2024-2023 2023 Q3 2024-2023 2023\n(in thousands)\nCrocs Brand:\nWholesale $ 395,564 $ 369,177 $ 1,292,847 $ 1,187,081 7.1 % 8.9 % 7.8 % 10.1 %\nDirect-to-consumer 462,534 429,592 1,223,056 1,093,416 7.7 % 11.9 % 8.0 % 12.7 %\nTotal Crocs Brand 858,098 798,769 2,515,903 2,280,497 7.4 % 10.3 % 7.9 % 11.3 %\nHEYDUDE Brand:\nWholesale 113,018 146,501 361,600 463,189 (22.9)% (21.9)% (22.9)% (21.9)%\nDirect-to-consumer 91,084 100,447 234,832 258,564 (9.3)% (9.2)% (9.3)% (9.2)%\nTotal HEYDUDE Brand 204,102 246,948 596,432 721,753 (17.4)% (17.4)% (17.4)% (17.4)%\nTotal consolidated revenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717 $ 3,112,335 $ 3,002,250 1.6 % 3.7 % 2.0 % 4.5 %\n(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues increased compared to the same period in 2023, driven by higher Crocs Brand\nrevenues, partially offset by lower HEYDUDE Brand revenues. Revenues increased $16.5 million, or 1.6%, from higher volume of $33.1 million, or 3.2%,\ndue to higher volume in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by lower volume in the HEYDUDE Brand. The overall increase was offset in part by lower ASP\nof $12.9 million, or 1.2%, driven by lower ASP in the Crocs Brand as a result of unfavorable product mix as well as slight net price decreases. This\ndecrease in ASP was partially offset by higher ASP in the HEYDUDE Brand from less discounting and increased pricing as well as favorable channel mix\nas we grow our retail business. Net unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of $3.7 million, or 0.4%, primarily in the Brazilian Real and Korean Won,\nalso decreased revenues.\nRevenues also increased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher ASP of $144.9 million, or 4.8%, driven by increased\npricing and favorable channel mix in both brands, favorable product mix in the Crocs Brand, and less discounting in the HEYDUDE Brand. This was\noffset in part by net unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of $23.1 million, or 0.8%, primarily in the Korean Won, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen.\nLower volume of $11.7 million, or 0.4%, as a result of lower HEYDUDE Brand volumes, partially offset by higher Crocs Brand volumes, also decreased\nthe overall increase in revenues.\nGross margin. Gross margin increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 59.6% compared to 55.6% in the same period in 2023. This was\nprimarily driven by prior year distribution costs of approximately 180 basis points associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in\nLas Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, lower product costs of 70 basis points, favorable brand mix of 70 basis points, and lower freight\ncosts of 40 basis points.\nGross margin in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 59.0% compared to 55.9% in 2023. This was primarily driven by lower freight costs in\nboth brands of approximately 100 basis points, prior year distribution costs of approximately 80 basis points associated with the move to our new\nHEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, favorable brand mix of 70 basis points, and lower product costs\nof 50 basis points.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A increased $55.7 million, or 18.1%, in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nsame period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by increased investments in talent and marketing of $17.9 million and $14.4 million, respectively.\nAdditionally, there were various other net cost increases, including incremental costs in our DTC channel, of $23.4 million.\nSG&A expenses increased $163.3 million, or 19.2%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by\nincreased investments in talent and marketing of $55.1 million and $40.9 million, respectively, as well as incremental costs in our DTC channel of $27.2\nmillion. The increase in SG&A expenses was also due to an $18.2\n23\nTable of Contents\nmillion impairment charge for information technology systems related to the HEYDUDE integration and impairment charges of $5.9 million related to our\nformer warehouses in Las Vegas, Nevada and the Netherlands. Other net costs increased SG&A by $16.0 million.\nForeign currency losses, net. Foreign currency losses, net, consist of realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement\nand settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign\ncurrency derivative instruments. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of\n$0.3 million compared to losses of $1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $3.9 million compared to losses\nof $1.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest expense. Interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $13.0 million, or 33.2%, compared to the three months\nended September 30, 2023. Interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased $39.0 million, or 31.2%, compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to lower\noutstanding borrowings and lower weighted average interest rates on the Term Loan B Facility (as defined herein) in the current year.\nIncome tax expense. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense decreased $11.3 million compared to the same period in\n2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 18.4% compared to an effective tax rate of 24.2% for the same period in\n2023, a 5.8% decrease. This decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of the Company's domestic and foreign earnings.\nOur effective income tax rate, for each period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate due to differences in income tax rates between\nU.S. and foreign jurisdictions.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income tax expense decreased $9.2 million compared to the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.0% compared to an effective tax rate of 23.3% for the same period in 2023, a 2.3% decrease. This\ndecrease in the effective rate was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of the Company’s domestic and foreign earnings. Our effective income tax rate, for\neach period presented, also differs from the federal U.S. statutory rate primarily due to differences in income tax rates between U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions.\n24\nTable of Contents\nReportable Operating Segments\nThe following table sets forth information related to our reportable operating segments, including a comparison of revenues and operating income by\nsegment:\nConstant Currency\n% Change % Change (1)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, Favorable (Unfavorable)\nYTD 2024- YTD 2024-\n2024 2023 2024 2023 Q3 2024-2023 2023 Q3 2024-2023 2023\n(in thousands)\nRevenues:\nCrocs Brand revenues (2) $ 858,098 $ 798,769 $ 2,515,903 $ 2,280,497 7.4 % 10.3 % 7.9 % 11.3 %\nHEYDUDE Brand revenues 204,102 246,948 596,432 721,753 (17.4)% (17.4)% (17.4)% (17.4)%\nTotal consolidated revenues $ 1,062,200 $ 1,045,717 $ 3,112,335 $ 3,002,250 1.6 % 3.7 % 2.0 % 4.5 %\nIncome from operations:\nCrocs Brand income from\noperations (2)(3) $ 313,264 $ 297,456 $ 932,921 $ 833,145 5.3 % 12.0 % 7.2 % 15.0 %\nHEYDUDE Brand income from\noperations (3) 26,191 31,776 108,704 173,905 (17.6)% (37.5)% (17.2)% (37.4)%\nEnterprise corporate (3) (69,626) (55,380) (219,629) (179,781) (25.7)% (22.2)% (25.7)% (22.2)%\nTotal consolidated income\nfrom operations $ 269,829 $ 273,852 $ 821,996 $ 827,269 (1.5)% (0.6)% 0.6 % 2.5 %\n(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, to reflect changes in the way management evaluates performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we updated our reportable\noperating segments to be (i) Crocs Brand and (ii) HEYDUDE Brand. Our ‘North America,’ ‘Asia Pacific,’ and ‘EMEALA’ segments as well as revenues and expenses related to Crocs\n‘Brand corporate’ have been consolidated to the ‘Crocs Brand.’ As a result of these changes, the previously reported amounts for revenues and income from operations for the three and\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 have been recast to conform to current period presentation.\n(3) In the first quarter of 2024, to reflect a change in the way management evaluates segment performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we made changes to segment\nprofitability related to certain foreign currency amounts impacting cost of sales. These amounts have shifted costs or benefits that were previously presented in each of our reportable\nsegments to ‘Enterprise corporate.’ We believe that the impact of these changes on prior periods is insignificant to each segment and thus have not recast prior periods.\nCrocs Brand\nRevenues. Crocs Brand revenues increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher\nvolume. The overall increase was partially offset by lower ASP, driven by unfavorable product mix and slight net price decreases.\nThe increase in Crocs Brand revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to higher\nvolume and higher ASP, due to favorable product mix, price increases in international markets, and favorable channel mix.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations for our Crocs Brand segment was $313.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an\nincrease of $15.8 million, or 5.3%, compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 62.5%, an increase of 60 basis points compared to prior year,\ndriven primarily by lower product costs and lower freight and fulfillment costs. The overall increase was partially offset by unfavorable channel mix.\nSG&A for our Crocs Brand segment increased $25.7 million, or 13.0%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in\n2023. This increase was primarily due to increased investments in talent and marketing.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, income from operations for our Crocs Brand was $932.9 million, an increase of $99.8 million, or\n12.0%, compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 61.8%, an increase of 160 basis\n25\nTable of Contents\npoints, primarily due to lower product costs, lower freight costs, and price increases in international markets. The overall increase was partially offset by\nunfavorable channel mix.\nSG&A for our Crocs Brand increased $83.0 million, or 15.4%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023,\nprimarily due to increased investments in marketing and talent, increased facilities costs as we expand our retail footprint, increased depreciation and\namortization expense, and higher variable expenses related to higher revenues in the DTC channel.\nHEYDUDE Brand\nRevenues. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues decreased compared to 2023, primarily due to lower volume. Higher ASP, primarily\ndue to less discounting and increased pricing as well as favorable channel mix as we grow our retail business, partially offset the overall decrease to\nrevenues.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, revenues decreased compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower volume. Higher\nASPs, driven by less discounting and increased pricing, favorable channel mix, and product mix, partially offset this decrease.\nIncome from Operations. Income from operations for the HEYDUDE segment was $26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a\ndecrease of $5.6 million, or 17.6%, compared to 2023. Gross margin was 47.9%, an increase of 1,230 basis points, primarily due to lower freight costs,\nfavorable channel mix, and higher ASP, as described above. Additionally, there were prior year distribution costs associated with the move to our new\nHEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, offset in part by infrastructure investments incurred in the\ncurrent year associated with the move.\nSG&A for the HEYDUDE Brand segment increased $15.4 million, or 27.5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. This increase was primarily due to an increased investment in marketing and talent.\nIncome from operations for the HEYDUDE segment was $108.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of $65.2 million, or\n37.5%, compared to the same period in 2023. Gross margin was 47.7%, an increase of 380 basis points, driven in part by higher ASP, as discussed above,\nlower freight costs, and favorable channel mix. Additionally, there were prior year distribution costs associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE\ndistribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, offset in part by transition costs and infrastructure investments incurred in\nthe current year associated with the move.\nSG&A for the HEYDUDE Brand segment increased $32.6 million, or 22.8%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. This is primarily due to an increase in investment talent and marketing, impairment costs of the right-of-use assets for our former\nHEYDUDE Brand warehouses in Las Vegas, Nevada in the current year, and increased facilities costs as we grow our retail business. The overall increase\nwas partially offset by lower variable expenses related to lower revenues in the DTC channel.\nEnterprise Corporate\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, total net costs within ‘Enterprise corporate’ increased $14.2 million, or 25.7%, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. This increase was in part due to an increased investment in talent.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total net costs within ‘Enterprise corporate’ increased $39.8 million, or 22.2%, compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. This was primarily due to an increased investment in talent, an impairment charge for information technology systems related to the\nHEYDUDE integration, higher depreciation and amortization expense, and higher information technology costs.\n26\nTable of Contents\nStore Locations and Direct-to-Consumer Comparable Sales\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had 372 company-operated retail locations for the Crocs Brand, inclusive of 173 retail locations in North America and 199\nretail locations internationally. The Crocs Brand store count includes 9 temporary clearance stores. As of September 30, 2024, we had 43 company-\noperated retail locations for the HEYDUDE Brand, inclusive of 9 temporary clearance stores. As of September 30, 2023, we had 347 company-operated\nretail locations for the Crocs Brand, inclusive of 173 retail locations in North America and 174 retail locations internationally. As of September 30, 2023,\nwe had 11 company-operated retail locations for the HEYDUDE Brand, all of which were temporary clearance stores.\nDirect-to-consumer (“DTC”) comparable sales were as follows:\nConstant Currency (1)\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDirect-to-consumer comparable sales: (2)\nCrocs Brand 4.8 % 15.3 % 9.8 % 18.4 %\nHEYDUDE Brand (22.2)% 8.1 % (19.4)% 16.5 %\n(1) Reflects period over period change on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Comparable store sales include the revenues of stores that have been in\noperation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth\nmonth in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure and in the same\nmonth in the following year. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce comparable revenues are based on same site\nsales period over period. E-commerce sites that are temporarily offline or unable to transact or fulfill orders (“site disruption”) are excluded from the comparable sales calculation during\nthe month of site disruption and in the same month in the following year. E-commerce site disruptions in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month after the site has re-\nopened. Additionally, comparable sales do not include leap days in leap years.\nFinancial Condition, Capital Resources, and Liquidity\nLiquidity\nOur liquidity position as of September 30, 2024 was:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(in thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 186,122\nAvailable borrowings 574,182\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had $186.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $574.2 million of available borrowings, including $559.2 million\nof remaining borrowing availability under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) and $15.0 million of remaining borrowing availability under the\nCitibank Facility (as defined below). As of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) was fully drawn and there was no available\nborrowing capacity. We believe that cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our Revolving\nFacility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months.\nAdditional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt\nor equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, the success of our\noperations, global economic conditions, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets, among other things, could each impact our business and\nliquidity.\n27\nTable of Contents\nRepatriation of Cash\nAs a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows\nand capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely\nimpact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.\nAll of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. as of September 30, 2024 without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In\nsome countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash\nresources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and could adversely affect our liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we held $132.6 million of our total\n$186.1 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is\nheld. Of the $132.6 million, $2.4 million could potentially be restricted by local laws.\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility\nIn July 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended,\nthe “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. Since\nthat time, we have amended the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility of $750.0 million, which can be\nincreased by an additional $250.0 million subject to certain conditions (the “Revolving Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at\na variable interest rate based on (A) a Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus\n0.25%, (ii) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) the Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 1.00%), plus\nan applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.875% based on our leverage ratio or 1.35% to 1.975% for the Daily Simple SOFR based on the leverage\nratio, or (B) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.35% to 1.975% based on our leverage\nratio for one-month interest periods and 1.40% to 2.025% based on our leverage ratio for three month interest periods. Borrowings under the Credit\nAgreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers.\nThe Credit Agreement requires or required, as applicable, us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio\nof (i) 4.00 to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2022 through, and including, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (ii) 3.75 to 1.00 for the quarter\nended March 31, 2024, (iii) 3.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and (iv) 3.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter\n(subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits, among other things, (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions,\nincluding after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii) certain acquisitions so long as\nthere is borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial\ncovenants under the Credit Agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Revolving Facility were $750.0 million. At September 30, 2024, we\nhad $190.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $0.8 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility, which reduces amounts\navailable for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $559.2 million and $558.7 million,\nrespectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, which matures in November 2027.\nTerm Loan B Facility\nOn February 17, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A., as\nadministrative agent and lender, to among other things, finance a portion of the cash consideration for the HEYDUDE acquisition, which was amended on\nAugust 8, 2023 (the “August 2023 Amendment”) and on February 13, 2024 (the “February 2024 Amendment”). The Original Term Loan B Credit\nAgreement, as amended by the August 2023 Amendment and the February 2024 Amendment is referred to herein as the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement.”\nThe Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement provided for an aggregate term loan B facility in the principal amount of $2.0 billion. Prior to the February\n2024 Amendment, the outstanding balance was $820.0 million. Among other things, the February 2024 Amendment provided for a new $820.0 million\ntranche of term loans (the “2024 Refinancing Term Loans” and, such facility, the \"Term Loan B Facility\"), to refinance the then-outstanding principal\nbalance. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each subsidiary guarantor’s assets on a pari passu basis\nwith their obligations arising from the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and is scheduled to mature on February 17, 2029, subject to certain\n28\nTable of Contents\nexceptions set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, satisfying certain\nleverage ratios, the Company may, at any time, on one or more occasions, add one or more new classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal\namount of the loans of any existing class by requesting one or more incremental term facilities.\nPursuant to the reduced interest rate margins applicable to the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans, each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate\nborrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement), plus 1.25%. Each term\nloan borrowing which is a term SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B\nCredit Agreement) plus 2.25%.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility was fully drawn with no remaining borrowing capacity, and we had $575.0 million in outstanding\nprincipal on the Term Loan B Facility, which matures on February 17, 2029.\nThe Term Loan B Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, incurrence financial covenants, representations and\nwarranties, events of default and other provisions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan B\nCredit Agreement.\nAsia Revolving Credit Facility\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had one revolving credit facility in Asia with Citibank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch\n(the “Citibank Facility”), which, as amended, provides up to an equivalent of $15.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the Citibank Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding of\n$3.3 million on the Citibank Facility.\nSenior Notes Issuances\nIn March 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due March 15, 2029\n(the “2029 Notes”), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, the “2029 Notes Indenture”). Additionally, in\nAugust 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due August 15, 2031\n(the “2031 Notes”), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, “the 2031 Notes Indenture” and, together with the\n2029 Notes Indenture, the “Indentures” and, each, an “Indenture”). Interest on each of the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (collectively, the “Notes”) is\npayable semi-annually.\nThe Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after March\n15, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and\nunpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company also had the option to redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time\nbefore March 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid\ninterest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before March 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to 40% of\nthe aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes at a redemption price of 104.250% of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity\nissuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nThe Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2031 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after\nAugust 15, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company will also have the option to redeem some or all of the 2031\nNotes at any time before August 15, 2026 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and\naccrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before August 15, 2024, the Company could have\nredeemed up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount with the proceeds\nfrom certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.\nThe Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt, including the Credit Agreement, and are senior in\nright of payment to any of the Company’s future debt that is, by its term, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes are\nunconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company’s restricted subsidiaries\n29\nTable of Contents\nthat is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement and by each of the Company’s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantees any debt of\nthe Company or any guarantor under any syndicated credit facility or capital markets debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25.0 million.\nThe Indentures contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue\ncertain preferred stock; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments; declare or pay dividends or other\npayments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with the Company’s affiliates; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Notes.\nCash Flows\nNine Months Ended September 30, $ Change % Change\n2024 2023 Favorable (Unfavorable)\n(in thousands)\nCash provided by operating activities $ 670,549 $ 580,726 $ 89,823 15.5 %\nCash used in investing activities (50,857) (86,468) 35,611 41.2 %\nCash used in financing activities (583,673) (557,852) (25,821) (4.6)%\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash,\ncash equivalents, and restricted cash 429 (262) 691 263.7 %\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents,\nand restricted cash $ 36,448 $ (63,856) $ 100,304 157.1 %\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities consists of net income adjusted for noncash items and changes in working capital. Cash\nprovided by operating activities increased $89.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30,\n2023, driven by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items, of $102.5 million, partially offset by decreases in operating assets and liabilities of $12.7\nmillion, primarily due to the change in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nInvesting Activities. There was a $35.6 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023. This was due to a decrease in purchases of property, equipment, and software.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities increased by $25.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from borrowings of\n$136.5 million and an increase of $176.2 million in repurchases of common stock. The overall increase in cash used in financing activities was partially\noffset by a decrease in repayments of borrowings of $277.3 million, a decrease of $8.8 million in repurchases of common stock for tax withholding, a\ndecrease of $0.6 million in deferred debt issuance costs, and other decreases in cash used of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThere have been no significant changes to the contractual obligations reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,\n2023, other than borrowings and repayments on the Term Loan B Facility, Revolving Facility, and Citibank Facility.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024, other than certain purchase commitments, which are described in Note 12 —\nCommitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial\nStatements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\n30\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, sales, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis.\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of\nwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nFor a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. There have been no other\nsignificant changes in our critical accounting policies or their application since December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 — Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I - Item\n1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and issued accounting\npronouncements that we believe may have an impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements when adopted.\n31\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences, and overall financing strategies.\nOur exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our Revolving Facility and certain financial instruments.\nBorrowings under our Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Facility bear interest at a variable rate and are therefore subject to risk based upon prevailing\nmarket interest rates. Interest rates fluctuate as a result of many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international\neconomic and political considerations, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nAs of September 30, 2024, we had borrowings with a face value of $1,465.0 million, comprised of the Notes, which carry a fixed rate, the Term Loan B\nFacility, and borrowings under our Revolving Facility. We also had $0.8 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Revolving Facility as of\nSeptember 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had long-term borrowings with a face value of $1,713.3 million and $1.3 million in outstanding letters\nof credit under our Revolving Facility.\nA hypothetical increase of 1% in the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under our Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Facility would increase\nour interest expense over the next twelve months by $7.7 million based on the balances outstanding for these borrowings as of September 30, 2024.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nChanges in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported U.S. Dollar condensed consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating\nresults and financial position of our international subsidiaries to U.S. Dollars using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements\nof income of our foreign subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar reporting currency using exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. As a result,\ncomparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to differences in the exchange rates in effect at the time such\nexchange rates are used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries.\nAn increase of 1% of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies when translating our financial results would have decreased our revenues\nand income before taxes during the three months ended September 30, 2024 by $4.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively. During the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, an increase of 1% of the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our revenues and income before\ntaxes by $12.8 million and $2.6 million, respectively. This analysis does not account for transactional fluctuations in accounts, such as those driven by\npurchasing power, which is defined as purchasing foreign goods in the U.S. Dollar but recognizing the cost in foreign currencies. The volatility of the\nexchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.\nIn order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we\nmay enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy or sell various foreign currencies. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are\nrecognized in earnings in the period that the changes occur or in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings for derivatives classified as\nnon-hedged or hedged, respectively, as defined in Note 6 — Derivative Financial Instruments in the accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Part I - Item 1. Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024, the U.S. Dollar\nnotional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately $226.6 million. The fair value of these contracts at\nSeptember 30, 2024 was an insignificant liability.\nWe perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our foreign currency forward exchange\ncontracts. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of changes in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. Dollar. As of September 30, 2024,\na 10% appreciation in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a net decrease in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $1.1 million.\nSee Part I - Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a\ndiscussion of the impact of the change in foreign exchange rates on our U.S. Dollar condensed consolidated statements of income for the three and nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n32\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an\nevaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such item is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(“Exchange Act”) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in\nour reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and\nthat such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as\nappropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of\nsuch controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended September\n30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The changes included the\nimplementation of information technology systems related to HEYDUDE, which resulted in additions and changes to our internal control over financial\nreporting. Except as described herein, there have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting.\n33\nTable of Contents\nPART II — Other Information\nITEM 1.

Additionally, on September 23, 2021, the Board\napproved an increase of $1.0 billion to our share repurchase authorization. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $548.9 million remained available for repurchase\nunder our share repurchase authorization. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at our sole discretion and future repurchases will be\nevaluated by us depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under our debt arrangements, and other factors. Share repurchases may be made in the\nopen market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular\namount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.\nITEM 5.

Reports Better-Than-Expected Third Quarter Results And Adjusts Full Year 2024 Outlook\n\nOctober 29, 2024\n\nDownload this Press Release PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n  * **Third Quarter Diluted EPS Up 17% to $3.36 and Adjusted Diluted EPS Up 11% to $3.60**\n  * **Third Quarter Revenues Increase 2% to $1.06 Billion**\n  * **Third Quarter Crocs Brand Grows****8% Constant Currency Fueled By Balanced Channel Growth**\n\n\n\nBROOMFIELD, Colo., Oct. 29, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Crocs, Inc. (NASDAQ: CROX), a world leader in innovative casual footwear for all, today announced its third quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n\"We reported third quarter results which exceeded our Enterprise guidance on sales and profitability,\" said Andrew Rees, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our overall performance including strong gross margin gains allowed us to accelerate our strategic investments in the quarter while continuing to deliver earnings per share growth through the deployment of our strong cash flow. Strength was led by our Crocs Brand fueled by 17% international and 8% direct-to-consumer growth.\"\n\nMr. Rees continued, \"We have sharpened our strategy around HEYDUDE as we work to create higher brand relevance through our product and marketing initiatives. While we are seeing early green shoots from these actions, HEYDUDE's recent performance and the current operating environment are signaling it will take longer than we had initially planned for the brand to turn a corner. While we are resetting our full-year outlook for HEYDUDE, I remain confident in the long-term trajectory of the brand.\"\n\nAmounts referred to as \"Adjusted\" or \"Non-GAAP\" are Non-GAAP measures and include adjustments that are described under the heading \"Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures.\" A reconciliation of these amounts to their GAAP counterparts are contained in the schedules below.\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Operating Results (Compared to the Same Period Last Year)**\n\n  * **Consolidated revenues** were $1,062 million, an increase of 1.6%, or 2.0% on a constant currency basis.

Adjusted SG&A of $364 million increased 19.4% from $305 million, and represented 34.2% of revenues compared to 29.1%.\n  * **Income from operations** of $270 million decreased 1.5% from $274 million, resulting in operating margin of 25.4% compared to 26.2%. Adjusted income from operations of $270 million decreased 8.8% from $296 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 25.4% compared to 28.3%.\n  * **Diluted earnings per share** of $3.36 increased 17.1% from $2.87. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.60 increased 10.8% from $3.25.\n  * During the quarter, we repaid $110 million of debt.

Adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance does not assume any impact from potential future share repurchases.\n  * Capital expenditures of $90 million to $100 million compared to prior guidance of $100 million to $110 million.\n\n\n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nA conference call to discuss third quarter 2024 results is scheduled for today, Tuesday, October 29, 2024, at 8:30 am ET.

AND SUBSIDIARIES****RECONCILIATION OF GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), we present \"Non-GAAP gross profit,\" \"Non-GAAP gross margin,\" \"Non-GAAP gross margin by brand,\" \"Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses,\" \"Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues,\" \"Non-GAAP income from operations,\" \"Non-GAAP operating margin,\" \"Non-GAAP income before income taxes,\" \"Non-GAAP income tax expense,\" \"Non-GAAP effective tax rate,\" \"Non-GAAP net income,\" and \"Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share,\" which are non-GAAP financial measures. We also present future period guidance for \"Non-GAAP operating margin,\" \"Non-GAAP effective tax rate,\" and \"Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share.\" Non-GAAP results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the periods presented.\n\nWe also present certain information related to our current period results of operations through \"constant currency,\" which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior year comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP results to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the board of directors, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures, in addition to corresponding GAAP measures, are useful to investors and other users of our condensed consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance and trends by providing meaningful information about operations compared to our peers by excluding the impacts of various differences.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross margin, and Non-GAAP gross margin by brand are useful performance measures for investors because they provide investors with a means of comparing these measures between periods without the impact of certain expenses that we believe are not indicative of our routine cost of sales. Our routine cost of sales includes core product costs and distribution expenses primarily related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, and packaging product and transportation costs associated with delivering products from distribution centers. Costs not indicative of our routine cost of sales may or may not be recurring in nature and include costs to expand and transition to new distribution centers.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses and Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenues are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a more meaningful comparison to prior periods and may be indicative of the level of such expenses to be incurred in future periods. These measures exclude the impact of certain expenses not related to our normal operations, such as costs related to the integration of HEYDUDE and other costs that are expected to be non-recurring in nature.\n\nNon-GAAP income from operations and Non-GAAP operating margin reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, as discussed above. We believe these are useful performance measures for investors because they provide a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\n\nNon-GAAP income before income taxes reflects the impact of Non-GAAP income from operations, as discussed above. We believe this is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a useful basis to compare performance in the period to prior periods.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP income tax expense is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides a basis to compare our tax rates to historical tax rates, and because the adjustment is necessary in order to calculate Non-GAAP net income.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP effective tax rate is a useful performance measure for investors because it provides an ongoing effective tax rate that they can use for historical comparisons and forecasting.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP net income is a useful performance measure for investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends and improves the comparability of our results to prior periods. This measure reflects the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\n\nManagement believes Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per common share are useful performance measures for investors because they focus on underlying operating results and trends and improve the comparability of our results to prior periods. These measures reflect the impact of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP selling, general, and administrative expenses, and Non-GAAP income tax expense, as described above.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, management believes it is helpful to evaluate our results excluding the impacts of various adjustments relating to special or non-recurring items. Investors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\n**CROCS, INC.

This adjustment represents the current period impact of these transfers.  \n  \n**_Non-GAAP Financial Guidance_**\n\nOur forward-looking guidance for consolidated \"adjusted operating margin,\" and \"adjusted diluted earnings per share\" represents non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or otherwise have been adjusted for special items from our U.S. GAAP financial statements. We consider these items to be necessary adjustments for purposes of evaluating our ongoing business performance and are often considered non-recurring. Such adjustments are subjective and involve significant management judgment.\n\nWhile we are able to estimate full year non-GAAP adjustments, we are unable to reconcile forward-looking adjusted measures to their nearest U.S. GAAP measure quarter-by-quarter because we are unable to predict the timing of these adjustments with a reasonable degree of certainty. By their very nature, special and other non-core items are difficult to anticipate with precision because they are generally associated with unexpected and unplanned events that impact our company and its financial results. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures for the guidance related to the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n**CROCS, INC.

Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure and in the same month in the following year. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce comparable revenues are based on same site sales period over period. E-commerce sites that are temporarily offline or unable to transact or fulfill orders (\"site disruption\") are excluded from the comparable sales calculation during the month of site disruption and in the same month in the following year. E-commerce site disruptions in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month after the site has re-opened.
