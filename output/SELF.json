The quarterly distribution represents an annualized dividend rate of $0.29 per share.\n\n**Company Objective**\n\nThe objective of Global Self Storage is to increase value over time for the benefit of its stockholders. Toward this end, the company will continue to execute its strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures, and expansion projects at its existing properties. The company's board of directors regularly reviews the strategic business plan, with emphasis on capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, FFO and AFFO performance, and optimal cash levels.\n\nThe management of Global Self Storage believes that the company's continued operational performance and capital resources position it well to continue executing its strategic business plan.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"In Q3, our same-store revenue growth led our peer group of publicly traded self-storage REITs,\" stated Global Self Storage president and CEO, Mark C. Winmill. \"We also led our peer group in same-store occupancy growth and NOI growth despite a continuing competitive move-in rate environment.\n\n\"We attribute these peer leading results to our targeted digital and local marketing activities that are combined with our operational excellence and professional competitive pricing strategies. These initiatives resulted in overall same-store occupancy at the end of the third quarter increasing by a peer-leading 170 basis points to a 91.5% occupancy rate at the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"This occupancy growth is even more impressive when considering that our marketing expenses decreased by 5.4% in the third quarter versus the same year-ago period. It truly underscores the efficiency and effectiveness of our well-tuned marketing strategies.\n\n\"Our third quarter results also reflect the benefits our newly designed website that we relaunched in Q4 of last year. The redesigned site features an enhanced user interface designed for better visitor engagement and greater attention to our now more than 3,200 tenant reviews that highlight the superior tenant value we deliver.\n\n\"To further strengthen this positive message, during the third quarter we launched a new video reviews section on the [customer reviews](https://pr.report/44if) page of our website. We believe our reviews are a valuable asset that demonstrates the strength of our highly effective customer-focused management approach. Our reviews consistently reflect a high level of satisfaction, with an average rating of more than 4.8 out of 5 stars.\n\n\"While our commitment to exceptional customer service and innovative marketing strategies help garner positive reviews, we believe more importantly these efforts also help us attract high-quality tenants who tend to store with us longer than the industry average. In fact, at the close of the third quarter, our peer-leading same-store average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.4 years, an increase from approximately 3.3 years a year ago.\n\n\"We remain confident that our professional management techniques will continue to maximize revenue and NOI growth in our self storage portfolio. We also believe our pleasant, clean, safe and hassle-free rental process delivers the best customer experience in the industry, and that our proven marketing strategies will continue to draw high-quality tenants that drive favorable stockholder returns.\n\n\"Our strong balance sheet-which includes capital resources totaling approximately $25.1 million-enables us to pursue growth through self-storage property acquisitions, joint ventures, and expansion of existing properties. We continue to explore opportunities in secondary and tertiary markets in select regions of the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. These markets continue to experience limited supply growth as well as less competition from other professionally managed self-storage operators.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect to continue to integrate new technologies that enable us to maximize revenue. We also plan to take further steps to control expenses. We currently believe these efforts will have a positive effect in the current quarter and make an even more meaningful impact in 2025 and beyond.\n\n\"We will remain focused especially on opportunities where we can apply our professional management techniques to optimize occupancy, revenue generation and NOI. Our strong track record of operational performance-even under challenging economic conditions-positions us well to execute our strategic business plan and continue to build value for our stockholders over the long term.\"\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nTotal revenues increased 3.6% to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, with the increase due primarily to increases in occupancy and existing tenant rates under the company's proprietary revenue rate management program. The increase was partially offset by lower move-in rental rates which were in line with lower rates across U.S. markets.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 2.9% to $2.33 million compared to $2.26 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses which resulted from an increase in professional fees and employment costs. The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in store-level operating expenses.\n\nOperating income increased 5.4% to $873,000, as compared to $829,000 in the same period last year, which was primarily due to increased total revenues combined with decreased store operating expenses.\n\nNet income increased to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share from $271,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. Contributing to the increase was an unrealized gain in marketable equity securities compared to an unrealized loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nCapital resources totaled approximately $25.1 million, comprised of $6.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $3.2 million in marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and $15 million remains available under the company's revolving credit facility.\n\n**Q3 2024 Same-Store Results**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the company owned 12 same-store properties and managed one third party owned property, and there were no non-same-store properties.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, same-store revenues increased 3.6% to $3.2 million compared to the same period last year.\n\nSame-store cost of operations decreased 0.8% to $1.15 million compared to $1.16 million in the same period last year. This decrease in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to decreased expenses for real estate property taxes, and to a lesser extent decreased expenses for repairs and maintenance, administrative, marketing and utilities.\n\nSame-store NOI increased 6.3% to $2.0 million compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in cost of operations.\n\nSame-store occupancy at September 30, 2024 increased to 91.5% from 89.8% at September 30, 2023.\n\nSame-store average duration of tenant stay at September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.4 years compared to approximately 3.3 years at September 30, 2023.\n\nFor a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,\" below.\n\n**Q3 2024 Operating Results**\n\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 increased to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share from $271,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nProperty operations expense decreased to $1.15 million from $1.16 million in the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $762,000 from $684,000 in the same period last year.\n\nBusiness development costs decreased to $2,012 for the quarter from $5,903 in the same period last year.\n\nInterest expense increased to $259,000 from $213,000 in the year-ago period. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap and the decrease in cash settlements under the interest rate cap.\n\nFFO was consistent at $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the quarter and in the same period last year.\n\nAFFO increased 2.2% to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to AFFO of $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, total revenues increased 1.4% to $9.3 million, as compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to increased occupancies and increases in existing tenant rates under the company's revenue rate management program.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 increased 6.8% to $7.2 million, as compared to $6.8 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in store level expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increase in store level operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and property insurance.\n\nOperating income decreased 13.6% to $2.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to $2.4 million in the same period last year.\n\nNet income was $2.0 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Same-Store Results**\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, same-store revenues increased 1.5% to $9.3 million compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to increased occupancies and increases in existing tenant rates under the company's revenue rate management program.\n\nSame-store cost of operations in the first nine months increased 5.4% to $3.6 million compared to $3.4 million in the same period last year. This increase in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to increased expenses for direct store costs, and to a lesser extent expenses for employment, landscaping, administrative, real estate property tax and lien administration. The increase in same-store cost of operations was partially offset by decreased repairs and maintenance, utilities and marketing expenses.\n\nSame-store NOI decreased 0.7% to $5.74 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $5.78 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to more muted revenue growth and increased cost of operations.\n\nFor a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,\" below.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Operating Results**\n\nNet income in the first nine months of 2024 increased to $2.0 million or $0.18 per diluted share from$1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nProperty operations expense increased to $3.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $3.4 million in the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $2.2 million in the same period last year.\n\nBusiness development costs decreased to $4,287 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $11,152 in the same period last year.\n\nInterest expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased to $676,000 from $620,000 in the year-ago period. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap. The increase in interest expense was partially offset by cash settlements under the interest rate cap as well as lower interest payments under the company's term loan agreement.\n\nFFO in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 11.5% to $2.9 million or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to FFO of $3.2 million or $0.29 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\nAFFO in the first nine months of 2024 decreased 8.5% to $3.1 million or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to AFFO of $3.4 million or $0.30 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**Q3 2024 and First Nine Months FFO and AFFO (Unaudited)**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,** | **For the Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net income** | $ | 1,181,657 | $ | 270,758 | $ | 2,039,337 | $ | 1,841,369  \nEliminate items excluded from FFO:  \nUnrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities | (499,283 | ) | 411,969 | (403,935 | ) | 165,266  \nDepreciation and amortization | 409,227 | 409,245 | 1,225,290 | 1,224,624  \n**FFO attributable to common stockholders** | **1,091,601** | **1,091,972** | **2,860,692** | **3,231,259**  \nAdjustments:  \nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards | 74,207 | 44,720 | 218,136 | 126,428  \nBusiness development | 2,012 | 5,903 | 4,287 | 11,152  \n**AFFO attributable to common stockholders** | **$** | **1,167,820** | **$** | **1,142,595** | **$** | **3,083,115** | **$** | **3,368,839**  \nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders - basic | $ | 0.11 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.17  \nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.16  \nFFO per share - diluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.26 | $ | 0.29  \nAFFO per share - diluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.28 | $ | 0.30  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic | 11,101,705 | 11,048,877 | 11,087,613 | 11,041,578  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted | 11,159,187 | 11,090,674 | 11,127,016 | 11,084,684  \n  \n**Additional Information**\n\nAdditional information about the company's third quarter of 2024 results, including financial statements and related notes, is available on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and posted to the investor relations section of the company's [website](https://pr.report/44ig).\n\n**About Global Self Storage**\n\nGlobal Self Storage is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self-storage properties. The company's self-storage properties are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the company owns and/or manages 13 self-storage properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma.\n\nFor more information, go to [ir.globalselfstorage.us](https://pr.report/44ih) or visit the company's customer site at [www.globalselfstorage.us](https://pr.report/44ii). You can also follow Global Self Storage on [X](https://pr.report/44ij), [LinkedIn](https://pr.report/44ik) and [Facebook](https://pr.report/44il).\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\") and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (\"NAREIT\") and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT's net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes changes in unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.\n\nAdjusted FFO (\"AFFO\") and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.\n\nWe believe net operating income or \"NOI\" is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nNOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.\n\n**Same-Store Self Storage Operations Definition**\n\nWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, or new ground-up developments. At September 30, 2024, we owned 12 same-store properties and zero non same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, and NOI, stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions, or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements**\n\nCertain information presented in this press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws including, but not limited to, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

All comparisons are to the same year-ago period unless otherwise noted.\n\n**Q2 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenues increased 0.7% to $3.1 million.\n\n  * Net income increased 2.3% to $592,000 or $0.05 per diluted share from $578,000 or $0.05 per diluted share.\n\n  * Same-store revenues increased 0.9% to $3.1 million.\n\n  * Same-store net operating income (NOI),a non-GAAP term, decreased 2.7% to $1.9 million.\n\n  * Same-store occupancy at June 30, 2024 was 93.0% compared to 90.5% at June 30, 2023 as the company optimized rental revenue. As of July 31, 2024, same-store occupancy increased to 94.2%.\n\n  * Same-store average tenant duration of stay at June 30, 2024 was approximately 3.3 years, which was about the same as of June 30, 2023.\n\n  * Funds from operations (FFO) decreased 16.4% to $0.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share (see definition of this and other non-GAAP measures and their reconciliation to GAAP, below).\n\n  * Adjusted FFO (AFFO), a non-GAAP term, decreased 13.2% to $1.0 million or $0.09 per diluted share.\n\n  * Maintained and covered quarterly dividend of $0.0725 per common share.\n\n  * Current capital resources total approximately $24.8 million, comprised of $7.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $2.7 million in marketable securities as of June 30, 2024; and $15 million available under the company's revolving credit facility.\n\n\n\n\n**First Half 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenues increased 0.3% to $6.1 million.\n\n  * Net income totaled $0.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share.\n\n  * Same-store revenues increased 0.5% to $6.1 million.\n\n  * Same-store NOI decreased 4.2% to $3.7 million.\n\n  * FFO decreased 17.3% to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share.\n\n  * AFFO decreased 14.0% to $1.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share.\n\n  * Maintained and covered dividend of $0.145 per common share.\n\n\n\n\n**Extension of Revolving Credit Facility**\n\nAs of July 6, 2024, the company extended its $15 million revolving credit facility with The Huntington National Bank for another three years with an option to extend it for a fourth year. This enables Global Self Storage to pursue growth through self-storage property acquisitions, joint ventures, and expansion of its existing properties.\n\n**Dividend**\n\nOn June 1, 2024, the company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0725 per share, consistent with the quarterly dividend for the year-ago period and previous quarter. The quarterly distribution represents an annualized dividend rate of $0.29 per share.\n\n**Company Objective**\n\nThe objective of the company is to increase value over time for the benefit of its stockholders. Toward this end, the company will continue to execute its strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures, and expansion projects at its existing properties. The company's board of directors regularly reviews the strategic business plan, with emphasis on capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, FFO and AFFO performance, and optimal cash levels.\n\nThe management of Global Self Storage believes that the company's continued operational performance and capital resources position it well to continue executing its strategic business plan.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"Our second quarter same-store revenue growth was up modestly from the same period last year, but the percentage growth led our peer group of publicly traded self-storage REITs,\" stated Global Self Storage president and CEO, Mark C. Winmill.\n\n\"This was achieved despite a more competitive move-in rate environment being driven by lower demand resulting from the muted housing market and general economic headwinds. Altogether, this has led to lower year-over-year move-in rental rates for self-storage providers across U.S. markets.\n\n\"We attribute our notable same-store occupancy growth to our targeted digital and local marketing initiatives, which have proved cost effective. These initiatives helped to increase overall same-store occupancy at the end of the second quarter by a peer-leading growth of 2.5% to approximately 93.0% at the end of the second quarter. This growth is even more impressive when considering that our marketing expenses decreased by 15.2% in the second quarter as compared to the same period last year.\n\n\"Since the end of the second quarter, this overall same-store occupancy has continued to improve, increasing 1.2 percentage points to 94.2% as of July 31, 2024. These gains continue to be driven by the combination of our digital and local marketing campaigns and competitive pricing strategies.\n\n\"The increased occupancy also helped drive growth in other property related income (such as from tenant insurance), which increased overall by 10.3% over the same year-ago quarter.\n\n\"We have also continued to realize benefits from the relaunch of our website at the end of last year. The redesigned site features an enhanced user interface designed for better engagement and awareness of our now more than 3,100 tenant reviews. Our reviews are a tremendous asset, with a combined average rating of more than 4.8 out of 5 stars. These reviews reflect the strength of our customer service-centric approach to management.\n\n\"Our robust balance sheet, including capital resources currently totaling approximately $24.8 million, enables us to pursue growth through self-storage property acquisitions, joint ventures, and expansion of our existing properties. We continue to explore opportunities in select regions across the U.S., particularly where we find supply growth is limited and competition from other professionally managed operators is generally less.\n\n\"We are focused especially on opportunities where we can apply our professional management techniques to optimize occupancy, revenue generation, and NOI. Our strong track record of operational performance-even under challenging economic conditions-positions us well to execute our strategic business plan and continue to build value for our stockholders over the long term.\"\n\n**Q2 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nTotal revenues increased 0.7% to $3.1 million in the second quarter of 2024, with the increase due primarily to increases in occupancy and existing tenant rates under the company's proprietary revenue rate management program. The increase was offset by lower move-in rental rates.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 7.1% to $2.5 million compared to $2.3 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was attributable to an increase in store level expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increase in store level operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and property insurance. The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in marketing expense.\n\nOperating income decreased 18.3% to $636,000, as compared to $778,000 in the same period last year, which was primarily due to increased total expenses.\n\nNet income increased to $592,000 or $0.05 per diluted share from $578,000 or $0.05 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. Contributing to the increase was an unrealized gain in marketable equity securities compared to an unrealized loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nCurrent capital resources total approximately $24.8 million, comprised of $7.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $2.7 million in marketable securities as of June 30, 2024; and $15 million available under the company's revolving credit facility.\n\n**Q2 2024 Same-Store Results**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the company owned 12 same-store properties and managed one third party owned property, and there were no non-same-store properties.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, same-store revenues increased 0.9% to $3.1 million compared to the same period last year.\n\nSame-store cost of operations increased 7.4% to $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million in the same period last year. This increase in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs, real estate property taxes, insurance costs.\n\nSame-store NOI decreased 2.7% to $1.9 million compared to $2.0 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to more muted revenue growth and the increased cost of operations mentioned above.\n\nSame-store occupancy at June 30, 2024 increased to 93.0% from 90.5% at June 30, 2023. As of July 31, 2024, occupancy at the company's same-store properties was 94.2%.\n\nSame-store average duration of tenant stay at June 30, 2024 was approximately 3.3 years compared to approximately 3.3 years at June 30, 2023.\n\nFor a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,\" below.\n\n**Q2 2024 Operating Results**\n\nNet income in the second quarter of 2024 increased to $592,000 or $0.05 per diluted share from $578,000 or $0.05 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nProperty operations expense increased to $1.2 million from $1.1 million in the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $893,000 from $810,000 in the same period last year.\n\nBusiness development costs were zero for the quarter and in the same period last year.\n\nInterest expense increased to $211,000 from $171,000 in the year-ago period. The increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap.\n\nFFO decreased 16.4% to $0.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share compared to FFO of $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\nAFFO decreased 13.2% to $1.0 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to AFFO of $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**First Half 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nFor the first half of 2024, total revenues increased 0.3% to $6.14 million, as compared to $6.12 million in the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in existing tenant rates under the company's revenue rate management program.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the first half of 2024 increased 8.7% to $4.9 million, as compared to $4.5 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in store level expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increase in store level operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs, property insurance, and real estate property taxes.\n\nOperating income decreased 23.4% to $1.2 million in the first half of 2024, as compared to $1.6 million in the same period last year.\n\nNet income was $0.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share in the first half of 2024, as compared to $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**First Half 2024 Same-Store Results**\n\nFor the first half of 2024, same-store revenues increased 0.5% to $6.1 million compared to $6.08 million in the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to an increase in existing tenant rates under the company's revenue rate management program.\n\nSame-store cost of operations in the first half increased 8.6% to $2.4 million compared to $2.2 million in the same period last year. This increase in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs, real estate property taxes and property insurance costs.\n\nSame-store NOI decreased 4.2% to $3.7 million in the first half of 2024, compared to $3.9 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to more muted revenue growth and increased cost of operations.\n\nFor a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,\" below.\n\n**First Half 2024 Operating Results**\n\nNet income in the first half of 2024 was $0.9 million or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to $1.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the first half of 2023.\n\nProperty operations expense increased to $2.4 million in the first half of 2024, as compared to $2.2 million in the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $1.7 million in the first half of 2024, as compared to $1.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nBusiness development costs decreased to $2,275 in the first half of 2024 compared to $5,249 in the same period last year.\n\nInterest expense for the first half of 2024 increased to $416,000 from $407,000 in the year-ago period. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap partially offset by cash settlements under the interest rate cap from the difference between the reference interest rate and the strike rate and lower interest payments under the company's term loan agreement.\n\nFFO in the first half of 2024 decreased 17.3% to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to FFO of $2.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\nAFFO in the first half of 2024 increased 14.0% to $1.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to AFFO of $2.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**Q2 2024 and Second Half FFO and AFFO (Unaudited)**\n\n**For the Three Months Ended June 30,** | **For the Six Months Ended June 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net income** | $ | 591,530 | $ | 578,070 | $ | 857,680 | $ | 1,570,611  \nEliminate items excluded from FFO:  \nUnrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities | (79,530 | ) | 115,347 | 95,348 | (246,703 | )  \nDepreciation and amortization | 409,136 | 408,538 | 816,064 | 815,379  \n**FFO attributable to common stockholders** | **921,136** | **1,101,955** | **1,769,092** | **2,139,287**  \nAdjustments:  \nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards | 72,925 | 43,921 | 143,929 | 81,708  \nBusiness development | - | - | 2,275 | 5,249  \n**AFFO attributable to common stockholders** | **$** | **994,061** | **$** | **1,145,876** | **$** | **1,915,296** | **$** | **2,226,244**  \nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders - basic | $ | 0.05 | $ | 0.05 | $ | 0.08 | $ | 0.14  \nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted | $ | 0.05 | $ | 0.05 | $ | 0.08 | $ | 0.14  \nFFO per share - diluted | $ | 0.08 | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.16 | $ | 0.19  \nAFFO per share - diluted | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.17 | $ | 0.20  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic | 11,087,539 | 11,041,503 | 11,080,489 | 11,037,868  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted | 11,134,894 | 11,083,258 | 11,121,296 | 11,081,799  \n  \n**Additional Information**\n\nAdditional information about the company's second quarter of 2024 results, including financial statements and related notes, is available on Form 10-Q as filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and posted to the investor relations section of the company's [website](https://pr.report/1ea6).\n\n**About Global Self Storage**\n\nGlobal Self Storage is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self-storage properties. The company's self-storage properties are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the company owns and/or manages 13 self-storage properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma.\n\nFor more information, go to [ir.globalselfstorage.us](https://pr.report/1ea7) or visit the company's customer site at [www.globalselfstorage.us](https://pr.report/1ea8).

NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT's net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes changes in unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.\n\nAdjusted FFO (\"AFFO\") and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.\n\nWe believe net operating income or \"NOI\" is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nNOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.\n\n**Same-Store Self Storage Operations Definition**\n\nWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, or new ground-up developments. At June 30, 2024, we owned twelve same-store properties and zero non same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, and NOI, stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions, or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements**\n\nCertain information presented in this press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws including, but not limited to, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements include statements concerning the company's plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions, and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"anticipates,\" or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. All forward-looking statements by the company involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the company, which may cause the company's actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements. The company may also make additional forward looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by the company or on its behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Investors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, and other factors, together with all of the other information included in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and similar information. All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, the company's examination of historical operating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based upon the company's current expectations and various assumptions. The company's expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, but there can be no assurance that the company's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. All forward looking statements apply only as of the date made. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. The amount, nature, and/or frequency of dividends paid by the company may be changed at any time without notice.\n\n**Company Contact:**\n\nThomas O'MalleyChief Financial OfficerGlobal Self Storage1 (212) 785-0900, ext. 267Email Contact\n\n**Investor Contact:**\n\nRon Both or Grant StudeCMA Investor RelationsTel (949) 432-7566[Email Contact](https://pr.report/1eac)\n\n**GLOBAL SELF STORAGE, INC.****CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS****(Unaudited)**\n\n**June 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Assets**  \nReal estate assets, net | $ | 54,727,596 | $ | 55,481,220  \nCash and cash equivalents | 6,956,246 | 6,921,779  \nRestricted cash | 145,597 | 106,767  \nInvestments in securities | 2,679,681 | 2,775,029  \nAccounts receivable | 155,626 | 169,410  \nPrepaid expenses and other assets | 641,327 | 629,196  \nLine of credit issuance costs, net | - | 50,801  \nInterest rate cap | 1,656 | 50,881  \nGoodwill | 694,121 | 694,121  \nTotal assets | $ | 66,001,850 | $ | 66,879,204  \n**Liabilities and equity**  \nNote payable, net | $ | 16,632,091 | $ | 16,901,219  \nAccounts payable and accrued expenses | 1,747,532 | 1,731,958  \nTotal liabilities | 18,379,623 | 18,633,177  \nCommitments and contingencies  \n**Stockholders' equity**  \nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value: 50,000,000 shares authorized;

Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the Company’s plans, objectives,\ngoals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or\nintentions relating to acquisitions, and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward-\nlooking statements can be identified by terminology such as “believes,” “plans,” “intends,” “expects,” “estimates,”\n“may,” “will,” “should,” or “anticipates,” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by\ndiscussions of strategy. All forward-looking statements made by the Company involve known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause the\nCompany’s actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements. The Company\nmay also make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking\nstatements, whether written or oral, by the Company or on its behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary\nstatements. All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, the Company’s examination of historical\noperating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based upon the Company’s current expectations and various\nassumptions. The Company’s expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and it believes there is\na reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that the Company’s expectations, beliefs and projections\nwill result or be achieved. All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. Except as required by law,\nthe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements which may be made\nto reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the\nforward-looking statements contained in or contemplated by this report. Any forward-looking statements should be\nconsidered in light of the risks referenced in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and in our other filings with the Securities and\nExchange Commission (the “SEC”). Such factors include, but are not limited to:\n• general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate, including changes in\ndemand, risks related to redevelopment (including expansion) of self storage properties, potential\nliability for environmental contamination, natural disasters and adverse changes in tax, real estate\nand zoning laws and regulations;\n• risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies in the markets in which we\noperate, including risks related to current economic conditions and the economic health of our\ncustomers;\n• the impact of competition from new and existing self storage and commercial properties and other\nstorage alternatives;\n• difficulties in our ability to successfully evaluate, finance, integrate into our existing operations, and\nmanage acquired and redeveloped properties;\n• risks related to our redevelopment of properties and expansions and related lease up at our existing\nproperties and/or participation in joint ventures;\n• risks of ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions, which may divert management’s\ntime and attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business;\n• the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national, state, and local laws and regulations\nincluding, without limitation, those governing the environment, taxes and our tenant reinsurance\nbusiness and real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), and risks related to the impact of new laws\nand regulations;\n• risk of increased tax expense associated either with a possible failure by us to qualify as a REIT, or\nwith challenges to intercompany transactions with our taxable REIT subsidiaries;\n• changes in federal or state tax laws related to the taxation of REITs, which could impact our status\nas a REIT;\n• increases in taxes, fees and assessments from state and local jurisdictions;\n3\n• security breaches or a failure of our networks, systems or technology;\n• our ability to obtain and maintain financing arrangements on favorable terms;\n• market trends in our industry, interest rates, the debt and lending markets or the general economy;\n• the timing of acquisitions and our ability to execute on our acquisition pipeline;\n• general volatility of the securities markets in which we participate;\n• changes in the value of our assets;\n• changes in interest rates and the degree to which our hedging strategies may or may not protect us\nfrom interest rate volatility;\n• increasing inflation;\n• our ability to continue to qualify and maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes;\n• availability of qualified personnel;\n• difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost;\n• fiscal policies or inaction at the U.S. federal government level, which may lead to federal\ngovernment shutdowns or negative impacts on the U.S economy;\n• estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future; and\n• economic uncertainty due to the impact of terrorism, infectious or contagious diseases or\npandemics, or war.\n4\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks\nsummarized in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included in this report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing:\nRisks Related to our Self Storage Properties and our Business\n• Adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business and more broadly could\nnegatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.\n• Our storage leases are relatively short-term in nature, which exposes us to the risk that we may have to\nre-lease our units and we may be unable to do so on attractive terms, on a timely basis or at all.\n• Our property taxes could increase due to various reasons, including a reassessment, which could adversely\nimpact our operating results and cash flow.\n• We face competition from other self storage properties, which may adversely impact the markets in which\nwe invest and in which our self storage properties operate.\n• Rental revenues are significantly influenced by demand for self storage space generally, and a decrease\nin such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more\ndiversified real estate portfolio or if we owned a larger number of self storage properties.\n• We may acquire properties subject to liabilities which may adversely impact our operating results.\n• Our investments in redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which could adversely\nimpact our economic performance.\n• We may be unable to make distributions in the future, maintain our current level of distributions or\nincrease distributions over time.\n• We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption\nor security breach through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information\ntechnology networks and related systems and harm our business.\n• Major public health issues and related disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets\ncould adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Debt Financings\n• We depend on external sources of financing that are outside of our control, which could adversely affect\nour ability to acquire or redevelop properties, satisfy our debt obligations and/or make distributions to\nstockholders.\n• The terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our economic performance.\nRisks Related to Our Qualification as a REIT\n• Our failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and\napplicable state and local taxes, which would reduce the amount of operating cash flow available for\ndistribution to stockholders.\n• To maintain our REIT qualification, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market\nconditions.\n• Failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax, which would reduce the operating cash\nflow available for distribution to stockholders.\n• We may not have cash available to make distributions.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n• The future sales of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock and dilute\nstockholders’ beneficial ownership.\n5\n• Any future offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or\npreferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend\ndistributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n• The market price and trading volume of our common stock may vary substantially.\n6\nPART I\nItem 1. Business.\nGeneral\nGlobal Self Storage, Inc. (the “Company”) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment\ntrust (“REIT”) that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties (“stores” or “properties”)\nin the United States. Our stores are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible, and secure storage space for\nresidential and commercial customers. As of December 31, 2023, the Company owned and operated, or managed,\nthrough its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio,\nPennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company was formerly registered under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) as a non-diversified, closed end management investment company. The\nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) order approving the Company’s application to deregister from the\n1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the Company changed its name to Global Self\nStorage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration from an investment company to an operating\ncompany reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and listed its\ncommon stock on NASDAQ under the symbol “SELF”.\nThe Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The\nCompany has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To\nthe extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax,\nwith certain limited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.\nBusiness Activities\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had 35 total employees and owned and operated, or managed,\nthrough its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores. As of December 31, 2023, these properties totaled 967,336 net\nleasable square feet and offered 7,039 storage units. In addition to traditional and climate-controlled units, many of\nthe properties feature both covered and outside auto/RV/boat storage. The Company invests in stores by acquiring\nstores through its wholly owned subsidiaries and operates primarily in one segment: rental operations.\nWe continue to evaluate and enact a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to help enable us to\nmaximize our stores’ financial performance and stockholder value. Our strategies in seeking to maximize our stores’\nfinancial performance and stockholder value include, among others, the following:\n• continue to implement and refine our move-in rate management systems in seeking to maximize occupancies\nand thus revenue derived from our store portfolio;\n• continue to implement and refine our proprietary existing tenant revenue rate management program in\nseeking to maximize revenue per leased square foot from our store portfolio;\n• continue to implement and refine our digital, drive-by, and referral marketing programs in seeking to attract\nmore and higher quality (e.g., credit card paying) customers to our stores at a lower net cost; and\n• continue to pursue the acquisition of single stores and small portfolios that we believe can add stockholder\nvalue.\nOur stores are generally located in densely populated and high traffic areas near major roads and highways.\nAll of our stores display prominent road signage and most feature LED marquee boards describing the store features\nand move-in rent specials. Our stores are generally located in areas with strict zoning laws and attentive planning\nboards which make it difficult for our competition to develop new properties near ours. As we evaluate potential stores\nfor acquisition, we seek stores in areas with these high barriers to entry.\nMost of our stores compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to\ngeneral economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends.\nBecause we operate in competitive markets, often where self storage consumers have multiple stores from which to\nchoose, such competition has affected and is likely to continue to affect our store results. We experience seasonal\nfluctuations in occupancy levels as well, with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to\n7\nincreased moving activity. We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online\nreservation system, the brand name “Global Self Storage,” and our economies of scale help enable us to meet such\nchallenges effectively.\nIn seeking to maximize the performance of our stores, we employ our proprietary revenue rate management\nprogram which help us to analyze, adjust, and set our move-in and existing tenant rental rates on a real-time basis\nacross our portfolio. Among other technologies, we employ internet data scraping of our local competitors’ move-in\nrental rates to help enable us to proactively respond and take advantage of changing market conditions across our store\nportfolio. Our operating results typically depend significantly on our ability to manage our storage units’ rental rates,\nto respond in a timely manner to prospective tenant inquiries, and to lease available storage units, and on the ability\nof our tenants to make required storage unit rental payments.\nWe have registered the trademark and developed the brand “Global Self Storage.” We have developed a\ncorporate logo and have incorporated it on all of our on-site signage, advertising and other marketing materials. This\nbranding process has included the creation and development of the www.GlobalSelfStorage.us website, whereby\nprospective customers can rent a storage unit or learn about the features of any of our self storage properties. We\ncontinue to develop the Global Self Storage internet presence through advertising and search engine optimization. We\nsolicit tenant reviews for posting to the “Testimonials” section of our website and encourage others to view these\nreviews. We have found referrals of current tenants to be a reliable source of new tenants. Existing self storage\ncustomers may also pay their storage unit rent online through www.GlobalSelfStorage.us.\nAttracting high quality, long-term tenants is a top priority for the Company and we strongly believe in tenant\nquality over tenant quantity. In our marketing efforts, we have seen success in our referral marketing program, through\nwhich our tenants may recommend Global Self Storage to their family, friends, and colleagues. We also believe our\nstore managers’ attention to detail – maintaining security, cleanliness, and attentive customer service – is essential to\nattracting high quality tenants.\nTenant leases at all of our stores are generally “month-to-month” leases. We seek to deliver at least 30 days’\nwritten notice of any rental rate change. Lease rates at each store may be set monthly, semi-annually, annually, or at\nany other time on a case-by-case basis as determined in the discretion of management. Tenants may be assessed late,\nadministrative, and/or other fees. To date, none of the Company’s stores have experienced any material delinquencies.\nEach of our stores features a rental and payment center kiosk available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\nwhere prospective tenants can rent a unit and current tenants can pay their rent. All of our stores have on-site property\nmanagers who are committed to delivering the finest customer service. We utilize a customer call center to handle\ntelephone inquiries from current and prospective tenants whenever our store managers are not available. They can\nrespond to questions about our properties and storage features, and book reservations. We seek to deliver convenience\nand high quality customer service to our tenants, as well as maintain clean and secure stores at all times.\nPlease refer to Item 7 herein for further discussion of, among other things, competitive business conditions,\nthe Company’s competitive position in the self storage industry, methods of competition, and the effect of existing or\nprobable government regulations on the Company’s business.\nOur Acquisition Strategy\nGeneral\nIn our store acquisition strategy, we will seek to continue to focus on secondary and tertiary cities in the Mid-\nWest, Northeast and Mid-Atlantic parts of the country where we believe there is relatively less self storage space per\ncapita available, generally resulting in greater demand for available self storage square feet; where new self storage\ndevelopment and permitting through the local planning and zoning boards is typically more difficult to secure thus\ncreating barriers to entry for new self storage competition; and where local new supply through new development is\ngenerally less prevalent.\n8\nWe continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that changes in interest rates\nmay impact our ability to obtain favorable rates for financing acquisitions. We will seek to continue to employ our\nstrict acquisition underwriting standards and remain a disciplined buyer and only execute acquisitions where we\nbelieve that our management techniques and innovations can strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value.\nFor future acquisitions, the Company may employ various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not\nlimited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.\nWe conduct or obtain environmental assessments in connection with the acquisition or redevelopment of\nadditional stores. Whenever the environmental assessment for one of our stores indicates that a store is impacted by\nsoil or groundwater contamination from prior owners/operators or other sources, we will work with environmental\nconsultants and where appropriate, state governmental agencies, to ensure that the store is either cleaned up, that no\ncleanup is necessary because the low level of contamination poses no significant risk to public health or the\nenvironment, or that the responsibility for cleanup rests with a third party.\nWe continue to actively review a number of store and store portfolio acquisition opportunities and have been\nworking to further redevelop and expand our current stores. We did not complete any self storage property acquisitions\nin 2023.\nOur Financing Strategy\nOur financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for\nour stockholders. For future acquisitions, the Company may employ various financing and capital raising alternatives\nincluding, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with\nthird parties.\nOn June 24, 2016, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company (“Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries”)\nentered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the “Term Loan Agreement”)\nbetween the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the “Term Loan Lender”).\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from Term Loan Lender the principal\namount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Term Loan Promissory Note”). The Term Loan Promissory\nNote bears interest at a rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security\nagreement (the “Term Loan Security Agreement”), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by\ncertain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc.\nacted as Special Purpose Vehicle Agent of the Term Loan Lender. The Company entered into a non-recourse guaranty\n(the “Term Loan Guaranty” and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the\nTerm Loan Security Agreement, the “Term Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Term Loan Lender of\ncertain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement. We have used some of\nthe proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to acquire four self storage properties in 2016.\nOn December 20, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (“Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”)\nentered into a revolving credit loan agreement (collectively, the “Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Credit\nFacility Secured Subsidiaries and TCF National Bank (“Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Credit Facility Loan\nAgreement, the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Credit Facility Lender in the principal\namount of up to $10 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Credit Facility\nPromissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3.00% over the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered\nRate and was due to mature on December 20, 2021. The obligations under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement are\nsecured by certain real estate assets owned by the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. We entered into a guaranty of\npayment on December 20, 2018 (the “Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Credit Facility Loan Agreement,\nthe Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the\npayment to the Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the\nCredit Facility Loan Agreement. As described in more detail below, the Credit Facility Loan Agreement has been\nreplaced in its entirety by the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement (as defined below) on July 6, 2021.\nOn December 18, 2019, we completed a rights offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,601,291\nshares of our common stock (“common stock”) at the subscription price of $4.18 per whole share of common stock,\npursuant to the exercise of subscriptions and oversubscriptions from our stockholders. We raised aggregate gross\nproceeds of approximately $6.7 million in the rights offering.\n9\nOn May 19, 2020, an affiliate of the Company (the “Borrower”) entered into a Paycheck Protection Program\nTerm Note (“PPP Note”) with Customers Bank on behalf of itself, the Company, and certain other affiliates under the\nPaycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)\nadministered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The Borrower received total proceeds of\n$486,602 from the PPP Note. On April 5, 2022, the Borrower was granted forgiveness of the entire PPP Note and any\naccrued interest. Upon forgiveness, the Company received $307,210 in cash from the Borrower, which was the amount\nattributable to the Company under the SBA's loan determination formula, and recorded a gain for such amount in its\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nOn June 25, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of\n1,121,496 shares of our common stock at the price of $5.35 per share. Subsequently, the over-allotment option was\nexercised increasing the total number of shares sold and issued to 1,289,720. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of\napproximately $6.9 million in the public offering after giving effect to the exercise of the over-allotment option.\nOn July 6, 2021, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) of the\nCompany entered into a first amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Agreement”) between the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National\nBank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (“Amended Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Amended Credit\nFacility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million, reduced to $14.75 million and $14.5 million in years 2\nand 3, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the “Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Amended\nCredit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month U.S. Dollar\nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate or 0.25% and is due to mature on July 6, 2024. The Company is considering, among\nother things, refinancing or finding a suitable replacement for the revolving line of credit in light of its upcoming\nmaturity. The publication of LIBOR ceased after June 30, 2023. The Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement\nprovides for a replacement index based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The interest rate on the\nAmended Credit Facility Promissory Note subsequent to June 30, 2023, is equal to 3% plus the greater of SOFR plus\n0.11448% or 0.25%. As of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate was 8.46%. The obligations under the\nAmended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Amended Credit\nFacility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into an amended and restated guaranty of payment on July 6,\n2021 (“Amended Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the\nAmended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents”)\nto guarantee the payment to the Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Amended Credit Facility\nSecured Subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Amended Credit\nFacility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Documents. The Company also maintains a bank account at the Amended Credit Facility Lender. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have not withdrawn proceeds under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We\ncurrently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement to\nfund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our\nportfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales\nAgreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time,\nshares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to\n$15,000,000, through the Agent. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, under the Sales Agreement,\nthe Company sold and issued an aggregate of 373,833 shares of common stock and raised aggregate gross proceeds\nof approximately $2,272,628, less sales commissions of approximately $45,491 and other offering costs resulting in\nnet proceeds of $2,008,436. There were no shares of common stock sold during the three and twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 under the Sales Agreement.\nOur Third-Party Management Platform\nOn October 23, 2019, we signed our first self storage client under our third-party management platform. As\nof December 31, 2023, the property, which was previously rebranded as “Global Self Storage,” had 137,318-leasable\nsquare feet and was comprised of 619 climate-controlled and non-climate-controlled units located in Edmond,\nOklahoma.\n10\nWe may pursue third-party management opportunities of properties owned by certain affiliates or joint\nventure partners for a fee, and utilize such relationships with third-party owners as a source for future acquisitions and\ninvestment opportunities.\nRegulation\nGeneral\nGenerally, self storage properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those\nrelating to lien sale rights and procedures, public accommodations, insurance, and the environment. Changes in any\nof these laws, ordinances or regulations could increase the potential liability existing or created by tenants or others\non our properties. Laws, ordinances, or regulations affecting development, construction, operation, upkeep, safety and\ntaxation requirements may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, loss of self storage sites or other\nimpairments to operations, which would adversely affect our cash flows from operating activities.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), all places of public accommodation are\nrequired to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. For additional information\non the ADA, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Costs associated with complying with the\nADA may result in unanticipated expenses.”\nInsurance activities are subject to state insurance laws and regulations as determined by the particular\ninsurance commissioner for each state in accordance with the McCarran-Ferguson Act, as well as subject to the\nGramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the privacy regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission pursuant thereto.\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended\n(“CERCLA”), and comparable state laws, we may be required to investigate and remediate regulated hazardous\nmaterials at one or more of our properties. For additional information on environmental matters and regulation, see\n“Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Extensive environmental regulation to which we are subject\ncreates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.”\nProperty management activities are often subject to state real estate brokerage laws and regulations as\ndetermined by the particular real estate commission for each state.\nREIT Qualification\nWe have elected and we believe that we have qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code, commencing\nwith our taxable year ended on December 31, 2013. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on\nour net taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all of our net taxable income to our stockholders and\nmaintain our qualification as a REIT. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in conformity with\nthe requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and we expect that our intended manner of\noperation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. To qualify, and\nmaintain our qualification, as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual\ninvestment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of\nour gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of\nour shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions,\nwe will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a\nREIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if\nwe qualify for taxation as a REIT, we still may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or\nassets. In addition, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, a portion of our business is conducted through,\nand a portion of our income is earned by, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to U.S.\nfederal corporate income tax at regular rates. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the\npreferential U.S. federal income tax rates that currently apply to certain distributions received by individuals from\ntaxable corporations, unless such distributions are attributable to dividends received by us from a TRS.\nCompetition\nWe compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for customers and\nacquisitions of self storage properties and other assets, including national, regional, and local owners, operators, and\ndevelopers of self storage properties. We compete based on a number of factors including location, rental rates,\n11\nsecurity, suitability of the property’s design to prospective tenants’ needs, and the manner in which the property is\noperated and marketed. We believe that the primary competition for potential customers comes from other self storage\nproperties within a three to five mile radius from our stores. We have positioned our properties within their respective\nmarkets as high-quality operations that emphasize tenant convenience, security, and professionalism.\nWe also may compete with numerous other potential buyers when pursuing a possible property for\nacquisition, which can increase the potential cost of a project. These competing bidders also may possess greater\nresources than us and therefore be in a better position to acquire a property.\nOur primary national competitors in many of our markets for both tenants and acquisition opportunities\ninclude local and regional operators, institutional investors, private equity funds, as well as the other public self storage\nREITs. These entities also seek financing through similar channels to the Company. Therefore, we will continue to\ncompete for investors in a market where funds for real estate investment may decrease.\nHuman Capital\nWe seek to create a diverse and inclusive work environment that values each employee’s talents and\ncontributions. Our success relies on the general professionalism of our property managers and staff which are\ncontributing factors to our ability to successfully secure rentals, retain tenants and maintain clean and secure self\nstorage properties. We seek to increase employee retention and well-being and our employees enjoy an attractive\nbenefit package that includes medical, dental, vision, life insurance, 401(k) with matching employer contribution, cash\nbonuses, and long-term equity compensation. We offer competitive health benefits and encourage our employees to\nparticipate in employee health and wellness programs. We also offer individualized counseling to our employees to\nassist them with their journey towards better health.\nWe also seek to promote diversity among our employees and management team. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 40% of our non-store (including finance, human resources, accounting, tax, legal, and marketing, but\nexcluding store-level operations) employees and independent contractors were women. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad 35 employees, which includes employees of our property management platform.\nIn order to attract and retain diverse top talent, we offer training and development opportunities for our\nemployees. In 2023, we offered training and development for our employees, which included anti-harassment training,\ncybersecurity training, and site manager training. We value the safety of our employees and provide regular training\nfor our employees to increase safety at our properties. During 2023, we continued to make masks and other personal\nprotective equipment available to our employees.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance\nWe are focused on building our company for the long-term to generate sustainable growth. To that end, we\nhave established a cross-functional Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) committee, comprised of\nmanagement, responsible for establishing our sustainability priorities and objectives. Management regularly evaluates\nsustainability risks faced by our portfolio and believe the low obsolescence, geographic diversification, and low\nemissions of our portfolio help to mitigate those risks. Our ESG committee reports annually to our board of directors\non the status of our ESG program, our progress against the goals we have set, and provides updates on the various\ninitiatives we have undertaken to improve our sustainability.\nA key area of focus from a sustainability perspective is minimizing the impact we make on the environment.\nSelf-storage remains a low-environmental impact business as it consumes less energy and water while emitting fewer\ngreenhouse gases than other real estate property types. We continue to look for ways to further reduce our low impact\nthrough a variety of initiatives including solar panel installations, HVAC upgrades, high-efficiency LED lighting\nretrofits, energy management systems, and paper reduction through our online rental platform. Also, in 2023, we\ncontinued to explore the installation of solar panels at our properties which we expect would reduce energy\nconsumption and costs at such locations.\n12\nClimate Change and Environmental Stewardship\nWe are committed to managing climate-related risks and opportunities in relation to our business. This\ncommitment is a key component of our recognition that we must operate in a responsible and sustainable manner that\naligns with our long-term corporate strategy and promotes our best interests along with those of our stakeholders,\nincluding our tenants, investors, employees, and the communities in which we operate.\nOur ESG committee guides our commitment to sustainability and has primary responsibility for climate-\nrelated activities. Our ESG committee reports annually to our board of directors, which oversees all of our\nsustainability initiatives.\nWe consider potential environmental impacts—both positive and negative—into our decision making across\nthe business. The following features of our properties reflect our commitment to responsible environmental\nstewardship:\n• Low environmental impact. Our properties have an inherently light environmental footprint that we\nfurther reduce through environmentally friendly capital initiatives.\n• Low obsolescence. Our properties are expected to retain functional and physical usefulness over many\ndecades. This contrasts with other real estate types that require frequent reinvestment (i.e., capital\nexpenditures) to stay current with tenant preference, remain competitive with newer competition, offset\nheavier wear-and-tear by users, and maintain structural operating efficiency.\n• High structural resilience. We operate our properties to avoid deferred maintenance, which may mitigate\nrisks from rising water levels, changing temperatures, and natural disasters.\nAvailable Information\nThe SEC maintains an Internet site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information\nstatements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Additional information about\nthe Company, not contained in this annual report or made a part hereof, may be found at www.GlobalSelfStorage.us.\nThe information on our website is not intended to form a part of or be incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment decision, you should\ncarefully consider the following risk factors, together with the other information contained in this annual report. Any\nof these risks described could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of\noperations, tax status or ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Additional risks and uncertainties not\ncurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business\noperations. If this were to happen, the price of our securities could decline significantly, and you could lose a part or\nall of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Self Storage Properties and our Business\nAdverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business and more broadly could negatively\naffect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results.\nOur operating results are dependent upon our ability to achieve optimal occupancy levels and rental rates\nat our self storage properties. Adverse economic or other conditions, such as during a government shutdown, in the\nmarkets in which we do business, may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to maintain or increase rents\nor require us to offer rental discounts. No single customer represents a significant concentration of our revenues. The\nfollowing adverse developments, among others, in the markets in which we do business may adversely affect the\noperating performance of our properties:\n• perceptions by prospective tenants of our self storage properties of the safety, convenience, and\nattractiveness of such properties and the areas in which they are located;\n13\n• industry slowdowns, relocation of businesses and changing demographics may adversely impact the\nmarkets in which we invest and in which our self storage properties operate;\n• periods of economic slowdown or recession, rising interest rates, or declining demand for self storage\nor the public perception that any of these events may occur could result in a general decline in rental\nrates or new rentals or an increase in tenant defaults; and\n• actual or perceived oversupply or declining demand for self storage in a particular area.\nOur operations may be affected by general economic, political and market conditions.\nOur operations may be affected by global and national economic, political and market conditions generally.\nAny of the following events could result in substantial impact to our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows:\n• changes in global, national, regional or local economic, demographic or capital market conditions;\n• a recession, slowdown or sustained downturn in the U.S. market, and to a lesser extent, the global\neconomy (or any particular segment thereof);\n• overall weakening of, or disruptions in, the financial markets;\n• perceived or actual economic distress or failures of financial institutions;\n• increases in interest rates, inflationary pressures;\n• supply chain related disruptions, such as those caused by the recent COVID-19 pandemic;\n• geopolitical challenges and uncertainties (including wars and other forms of conflict, terrorist acts\nand security operations), such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the severe\neconomic sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments against Russia\nand Russian interests, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas; and\n• changes in government rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including increases in taxes, changes\nin zoning laws and increasing costs to comply with environmental laws.\nAll of these factors are beyond our control. Any negative changes in these factors could affect our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur storage leases are relatively short-term in nature, which exposes us to the risk that we may have to re-lease\nour units and we may be unable to do so on attractive terms, on a timely basis or at all.\nIf we are unable to promptly re-let our units or if the rates upon such re-letting are significantly lower than\nexpected, then our business and results of operations would be adversely affected. Any delay in re-letting units as\nvacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results. In addition, lower than expected rental\nrates upon re-letting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth.\nIncreases in taxes and regulatory compliance costs may reduce our income and adversely impact our cash flows.\nIncreases in income or other taxes generally are not passed through to tenants under leases and may reduce\nour net income, funds from operations (“FFO”), cash flows, financial condition, ability to pay or refinance our debt\nobligations, ability to make cash distributions to stockholders, and the trading price of our securities. Similarly,\nchanges in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the\nrestrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures, which could result\nin similar adverse effects.\n14\nOur property taxes could increase due to various reasons, including a reassessment, which could adversely impact\nour operating results and cash flow.\nThe value of our properties may be reassessed for property tax purposes by taxing authorities including as a\nresult of the acquisition of new self storage properties. Accordingly, the amount of property taxes we pay in the future\nmay increase substantially from what we have paid in the past. Increases in property or other taxes generally are not\npassed through to tenants under leases and may reduce our results of operations and cash flow, and could adversely\naffect our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders.\nIncreases in operating costs may adversely affect our results of operation and cash flow.\nIncreases in operating costs, including insurance costs, labor costs, utilities, capital improvements, real estate\nassessments and other taxes and costs of compliance with REIT requirements and with other laws, regulations and\ngovernmental policies could adversely affect our results of operation and cash flow.\nWe depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any difficulties\nwe encounter in hiring, training, and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance.\nWe depend upon our on-site personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties, and any\ndifficulties we encounter in hiring, training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating\nperformance. The general professionalism of a site’s managers and staff are contributing factors to a site’s ability to\nsuccessfully secure rentals and retain tenants. If we are unable to successfully recruit, train and retain qualified field\npersonnel, our quality of service could be adversely affected, which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and\nreduced operating performance.\nWe face competition from other self storage properties, which may adversely impact the markets in which we invest\nand in which our self storage properties operate.\nIncreased competition in the self storage business has led to both pricing and discount pressures. This\nincreased competition could limit our ability to increase revenues in the markets in which we operate. While some\nmarkets may be able to absorb an increase in self storage properties due to superior demographics and density, other\nmarkets may not be able to absorb additional properties and may not perform as well.\nRental revenues are significantly influenced by demand for self storage space generally, and a decrease in such\ndemand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real\nestate portfolio or if we owned a larger number of self storage properties.\nBecause our portfolio of properties consists of only self storage properties, we are subject to risks inherent in\ninvestments in a single industry. A decrease in the demand for self storage space would have a greater adverse effect\non our rental revenues than it would if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio. Demand for self storage\nspace has been and could be adversely affected by ongoing weakness in the national, regional and local economies,\nchanges in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing self storage properties in an area and the excess amount of\nself storage space in a particular market. To the extent that any of these conditions occur, they are likely to affect\nmarket rents for self storage space, which could cause a decrease in our rental revenue. Any such decrease could\nimpair our operating results, ability to satisfy debt service obligations and ability to make cash distributions to our\nstockholders.\nFurther, currently we invest in a limited number of self storage properties. As a result, the potential effect on\nour financial condition, results of operations, and cash available for distribution to stockholders, resulting from poor\nperformance at one or more of our self storage properties could be more pronounced than if we invested in a larger\nnumber of self storage properties.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions, or integrating and operating\nacquired properties, which may adversely impact our growth.\nWe expect to make future acquisitions of self storage properties. We may not be successful in identifying\nand consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria, which may impede our growth. We may encounter\n15\ncompetition when we seek to acquire properties, especially for brokered portfolios. Aggressive bidding practices by\nprospective acquirers have been commonplace and this competition also may be a challenge for our growth strategy\nand potentially result in our paying higher prices for acquisitions including paying consideration for certain properties\nthat may exceed the value of such properties. Should we pay higher prices for self storage properties or other assets,\nour potential profitability may be reduced. Also, when we acquire any self storage properties, we will be required to\nintegrate them into our then existing portfolio. The acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our\ngrowth strategy than originally anticipated, may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert management’s\nattention away from day-to-day operations, which could impair our results of operations. Our ability to acquire or\nintegrate properties may also be constrained by the following additional risks:\n• the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing\nconditions;\n• spending more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to\nacquired properties;\n• the inability to build a captive pipeline of target properties that meet our rigorous underwriting standards;\n• the inability to accurately estimate occupancy levels, rental rates, operating costs or costs of improvements\nto bring an acquired property up to the standards established for our intended market position; and\n• encountering delays in the selection, acquisition, or redevelopment of self storage properties which could\nadversely affect returns to stockholders and stockholders could suffer delays in the distribution of cash\ndividends attributable to any such properties.\nWe may not be able to develop a captive pipeline of acquisition targets without the use of non-refundable deposits.\nWe may be required to use non-refundable deposits to develop a captive pipeline of acquisition targets. If we\nare unable to raise the capital necessary to consummate such acquisitions we may be forced to abandon all or some of\nthe acquisitions and forfeit any non-refundable deposits. If this occurs, it could adversely impact our operating results\nand our ability to pay any expected dividends to our stockholders.\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities which may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with\nrespect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by\npersons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors,\nofficers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. The costs associated with these liabilities may\nadversely impact our operating results.\nOur investments in redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which could adversely impact our\neconomic performance.\nIn deciding whether to redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected\nfuture performance of that property. These assumptions are inherently uncertain, and, if they prove to be wrong, then\nwe may be subject to certain risks including the following:\n• we may not complete redevelopment projects on schedule or within projected budgeted amounts;\n• we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring a property up to the standards established for its intended\nmarket position;\n• we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning, land use, building, occupancy and\nother required governmental permits and authorizations;\n• we may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly acquired property as quickly as expected or at all; and\n• we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all.\n16\nThe occurrence of such events could adversely affect the investment returns from these redevelopment\nprojects and may adversely impact our economic performance.\nStore ownership through joint ventures may limit our ability to act exclusively in our interest.\nWe may co-invest with third parties through joint ventures. In any such joint venture, we may not be in a\nposition to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the stores owned through joint ventures. Investments in\njoint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including\nthe possibility that joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital\ncontributions. Joint venture partners may have business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business\ninterests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives. Such investments also\nhave the potential risk of impasse on strategic decisions, such as a sale, in cases where neither we nor the joint venture\npartner would have full control over the joint venture. In other circumstances, joint venture partners may have the\nability without our agreement to make certain major decisions, including decisions about sales, capital expenditures,\nand/or financing. Any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners could result in litigation or\narbitration that could increase our expenses and distract our officers and/or directors from focusing their time and\neffort on our business. In addition, we might in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture\npartners, and the activities of a joint venture could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, even though we\ndo not control the joint venture.\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with the real estate industry.\nAn investment in us is closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets in which we own self\nstorage properties and subject to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate, including fluctuations in\ninterest rates, inflation or deflation; declines in the value of real estate; and competition from other real estate investors\nwith significant capital. Prevailing economic conditions affecting the real estate industry may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\nIlliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the\nperformance of our properties.\nWe may be unable to promptly sell one or more properties in response to changing economic, financial and\ninvestment conditions. We cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set\nby us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us. We may be\nrequired to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold. We cannot give\nassurances that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements. In acquiring a\nproperty, we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time\nor impose other restrictions, such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property.\nThese transfer restrictions may impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate. We\nmay also have joint venture investments in certain of our properties and, consequently, our ability to control decisions\nrelating to such properties may be limited.\nAny negative perceptions of the self storage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price.\nTo the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the self storage industry, the value of our\nsecurities may be negatively impacted.\nCosts associated with complying with the ADA may result in unanticipated expenses.\nOur self storage properties also are subject to risks related to changes in, and changes in enforcement of,\nfederal, state and local laws, regulations and governmental policies, including fire and safety requirements, health,\nzoning and tax laws, governmental fiscal policies and the ADA. Local regulations, including municipal or local\nordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers may restrict our use of\nour properties and may require us to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations at any\ntime with respect to our properties, including prior to acquiring a property or when undertaking renovations of any of\n17\nour existing properties. Further, compliance with the ADA and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated\nexpenditures that could significantly reduce cash available for distribution to stockholders. A failure to comply with\nthe ADA or similar state laws could lead to government imposed fines on us and/or litigation, which could also involve\nan award of damages to individuals affected by the noncompliance. Such noncompliance also could result in an order\nto correct any noncomplying feature, which could result in substantial capital expenditures.\nExtensive environmental regulation to which we are subject creates uncertainty regarding future environmental\nexpenditures and liabilities.\nUnder environmental regulations such as CERCLA, owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the\ncosts of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property.\nSuch laws often impose liability, without regard to knowledge or fault, for removal or remediation of hazardous\nsubstances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property, even after they no longer\nown or operate the property. Moreover, the past or present owner or operator of a property from which a release\nemanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases, as well as\nany damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases. The presence of such substances or materials, or\nthe failure to properly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s or operator’s ability to lease, sell\nor rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral.\nClimate change and regulatory and other efforts to reduce climate change could adversely affect our business.\nWe face a number of risks associated with climate change including both transition and physical risks. The\ntransition risks that could impact our company include those risks related to the impact of U.S. and foreign climate-\nand ESG-related legislation and regulation, as well as risks arising from climate-related business trends. Moreover,\nwe are subject to risks stemming from the physical impacts of climate change.\nNew climate change-related regulations or interpretations of existing laws may result in enhanced disclosure\nobligations that could negatively affect us and materially increase our regulatory burden. Increased regulations\ngenerally increase the costs to us, and those higher costs may continue to increase if new laws require additional\nresources, including spending more time, hiring additional personnel or investing in new technologies.\nWe also face business trend-related climate risks. Investors are increasingly taking into account ESG factors,\nincluding climate risks, in determining whether to invest in companies. Additionally, our reputation and investor\nrelationships could be damaged as a result of our involvement with activities perceived to be causing or exacerbating\nclimate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to\nconsiderations relating to climate change.\nFurther, significant physical effects of climate change including extreme weather events can also have an\nadverse impact on our properties. Additionally, both transition and physical risks associated with climate change could\nresult in increased operating costs for our properties. As the effects of climate change increase, we expect the frequency\nand impact of weather and climate related events and conditions to increase as well. These risks may adversely impact\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to litigation or threatened litigation or other claims that may divert management’s time\nand attention, require us to pay damages and expenses or restrict the operation of our business.\nWe may become subject to disputes with commercial parties with whom we maintain relationships or other\nparties with whom we do business. Any such dispute could result in litigation between us and the other parties.\nWhether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation, we may be required to devote significant management time\nand attention to its successful resolution (through litigation, settlement or otherwise), which would detract from our\nmanagement’s ability to focus on our business. Any such resolution could involve the payment of damages or expenses\nby us, which may be significant. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement with terms that restrict\nthe operation of our business.\nFrom time to time we may be required to resolve tenant claims and litigation and employment-related claims\nand litigation by corporate level and field personnel which could result in substantial liabilities to us. We also could\n18\nbe sued for personal injuries and/or property damage occurring at our properties. The liability insurance we maintain\nmay not cover all costs and expenses arising from such lawsuits.\nUninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and\ncash flow.\nWe maintain comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake, wind, extended coverage and rental loss\ninsurance (as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders, if any) with respect to our properties. Certain types of\nlosses, however, may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, such as losses due to earthquakes,\nhurricanes, tornadoes, riots, acts of war or terrorism. Should an uninsured loss occur, we could lose both our\ninvestment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property. In addition, if any such loss is insured, we may\nbe required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to\nreimburse us for the loss, or the amount of the loss may exceed our coverage for the loss.\nTo the extent we invest in publicly traded REITs, our performance may be subject to the risks of investment in such\nsecurities.\nThe value of our investments in REITs may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. Because REITs\nconcentrate their assets in the real estate industry, the performance of REITs is closely linked to the performance of\nthe real estate markets. Property values may fall due to increasing vacancies or declining rents resulting from\neconomic, legal, cultural or technological developments, rising interest rates, and rising capitalization rates. REIT\nprices also may drop because of the failure of borrowers to pay their loans and poor management. In addition, there\nare specific risks associated with particular sectors of real estate investments such as self storage, retail, office, hotel,\nhealthcare, and multi-family properties. Many REITs utilize leverage, which increases investment risk and could\nadversely affect a REIT’s operations and market value in periods of rising interest rates as well as risks normally\nassociated with debt financing. In addition, a REIT’s failure to qualify as a REIT under the Code, or failure to maintain\nexemption from registration under the Investment Company Act could adversely affect our operations and our\nqualification as a REIT under the Code. The failure of these investments to perform as expected may have a significant\neffect on our performance and our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nWe may be unable to make distributions in the future, maintain our current level of distributions or increase\ndistributions over time.\nThere are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of cash distributions to stockholders and\nthe determination to make distributions will fall within the discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors’\ndecisions to pay distributions will depend on many factors, such as our historical and projected results of operations,\nfinancial condition, cash flows and liquidity, maintenance of our REIT qualification and other tax considerations,\ncapital expenditure and other expense obligations, debt covenants, contractual prohibitions or other limitations and\napplicable law and such other matters as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. Actual cash\navailable for distributions may vary substantially from estimates. We may not have sufficient available cash from\noperations to make a distribution required to qualify for or maintain our REIT status. We may be required to borrow\nor make distributions that would constitute a return of capital which may reduce the amount of capital we invest in\nself storage properties. We cannot assure stockholders that we will be able to make distributions in the future, be able\nto maintain our current level of distributions or that our distributions will increase over time, and our inability to make\ndistributions, or to make distributions at expected levels, could result in a decrease in the market price of our common\nstock.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security\nbreach through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusions, or other methods could disrupt our information technology\nnetworks and related systems and harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and\nstore electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including, but not limited to,\nfinancial transactions and records, personally identifiable information, and tenant and lease data. In many cases, we\nrely significantly on third-party vendors to retain data, process transactions, and provide information technology and\nother system services. Our networks and operations could be disrupted, and sensitive data could be compromised, by\n19\nphysical or electronic security breaches, targeted against us, our vendors or other organizations, including financial\nmarkets or institutions, including by way of or through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, malware,\ncomputer viruses, attachments to e-mails, phishing, employee theft or misuse, or inadequate security controls. We rely\non third-party vendors and commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for\nprocessing, transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information. Although we make efforts\nto protect the security and integrity of our networks and systems, there can be no assurance that these efforts and\nmeasures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful, as such attacks\nand breaches may be difficult to detect (or not detected at all) and are becoming more sophisticated. In such event, we\nmay experience business interruptions or shutdowns; data loss, ransom, misappropriation, or corruption; theft or\nmisuse of confidential or proprietary information; or litigation and investigation by tenants, governmental or\nregulatory agencies, or other third parties. Such events could also have other adverse impacts on us, including, but not\nlimited to, regulatory penalties, breaches of debt covenants or other contractual or REIT compliance obligations, late\nor misstated financial reports, and significant diversion of management attention and resources. As a result, such\nevents could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and harm\nour business reputation.\nPrivacy concerns could result in regulatory changes that may harm our business.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Many jurisdictions\nin which we operate have imposed restrictions and requirements on the use of personal information by those collecting\nsuch information. Changes to law or regulations affecting privacy, if applicable to our business, could impose\nadditional costs and liability on us and could limit our use and disclosure of such information.\nMajor public health issues and related disruptions in the U.S. and global economy and financial markets could\nadversely impact or disrupt our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, the outbreaks of a number of diseases, including COVID-19, avian influenza, H1N1, and\nother viruses have increased the risk of a pandemic or major public health issues.\nWe believe that our level of business activity and the profitability of our business, as well as the values of,\nand the cash flows from, the assets we may own could in the future be impacted by a pandemic or other major public\nhealth issue. While we have taken preventive measures and other precautions, no predictions of specific scenarios can\nbe made with certainty and such measures may not adequately predict the impact on our business from such events.\nThe extent of the impact of a pandemic and any other pandemic or major health issue on us will depend on\nmany factors, including the duration and scope of the public health emergency, the actions taken by governmental\nauthorities to contain such pandemics or public health issues and their financial and economic impact, the\nimplementation of travel advisories and restrictions, the efficacy and availability of vaccines, the disparities in\nvaccination rates and vaccine hesitancy, the rise of new variants and the severity of such variants, the impact of the\npublic health emergency on overall supply and demand, goods and services, consumer confidence and levels of\neconomic activity and the extent of its disruption to global, regional, and local supply chains and economic markets,\nall of which are uncertain and difficult to assess. Moreover, many risk factors set forth in this annual report on Form\n10-K should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of a pandemic or other major public health\nissue.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Structure\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse\nconsequences to our stockholders.\nOur board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without the approval of\nstockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to\nqualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer\nbe required to distribute most of our net taxable income to stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on\nthe total return to our stockholders.\n20\nOur business could be harmed if key personnel with business experience in the self storage industry terminate their\nemployment with us.\nOur officers have experience in the self storage industry and our success will depend, to a significant extent,\non their services. There is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed with us. We do not generally maintain\nkey person life insurance. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior management could harm our\nbusiness.\nThere may be conflicts of interest resulting from the relationships among us, our affiliates, and other related\nparties.\nThe outside business interests of our officers may divert their time and attention away from us, and may\nresult in a potential conflict with respect to the allocation of business opportunities, which could harm our business.\nOur board of directors has adopted policies and procedures designed to mitigate these conflicts of interest, such as\nallocation procedures for determining the appropriate allocation of such business opportunities. Specifically, if any of\nour officers or directors who also serves as an officer, director, or advisor of our affiliates becomes aware of a potential\ntransaction related primarily to the self storage business that may represent a corporate opportunity for us and one or\nmore of our affiliates, such officer or director has no duty to present that opportunity to such affiliates and we will\nhave the sole right to pursue the transaction if our board of directors so determines. Notwithstanding the foregoing,\nour officers or directors are encouraged to notify our affiliates of such an opportunity.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control of our company.\nCertain “business combination” and “control share acquisition” provisions of the Maryland General\nCorporation Law (“MGCL”), may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or\nof impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock\nwith the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock. Pursuant to the\nMGCL, our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person.\nOur bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any\nperson of shares of our stock. However, there can be no assurance that these exemptions will not be amended or\neliminated at any time in the future. Our charter and bylaws and Maryland law also contain other provisions that may\ndelay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our common stock\nor that our stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest.\nOur rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited, which\ncould limit your recourse in the event of actions not in your best interest.\nOur charter limits the liability of our present and former directors and officers to us and our stockholders for\nmoney damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our present and\nformer directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability\nresulting from:\n• actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n• active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment and is\nmaterial to the cause of action.\nOur charter authorizes us to indemnify our present and former directors and officers for actions taken by\nthem in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Our bylaws require us to indemnify each\npresent and former director or officer, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, in connection with any\nproceeding to which he or she is made, or threatened to be made, a party to or witness in by reason of his or her service\nto us as a director or officer or in certain other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the\nexpenses incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of\ntheir ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against\nour present and former directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the current provisions in our charter\n21\nand bylaws or that might exist with other companies, which could limit your recourse in the event of actions not in\nyour best interest.\nOur charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult, which could make it difficult for our\nstockholders to effect changes to our management.\nOur charter provides that, subject to the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of preferred shares,\na director may be removed with cause, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast\ngenerally in the election of directors. Vacancies on our board of directors generally may be filled only by a majority\nof the remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum. These requirements make it more difficult to change\nour management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in our control that is in the best\ninterests of our stockholders.\nWe may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder\nconsent, which may subject us to different risks.\nWe may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time\nwithout the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments and engaging in business\nactivities that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and businesses described in this document.\nA change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may impact our ability to qualify or remain\nqualified as a REIT, or increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations.\nIf other self storage companies convert to a REIT structure or if tax laws change, we may no longer have an\nadvantage in competing for potential acquisitions.\nBecause we are structured as a REIT, we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to tax-motivated sellers\nthan our competitors that are not structured as REITs. However, if other self storage companies restructure their\nholdings to become REITs, this competitive advantage will disappear. In addition, new legislation may be enacted or\nnew interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), or the U.S.\nTreasury Department that could affect the attractiveness of the REIT structure so that it may no longer assist us in\ncompeting for acquisitions.\nOur board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best\ninterest of our stockholders.\nOur charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common\nstock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any\nclass or series without stockholder approval. In addition, our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued\nshares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or\nreclassified shares. Our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of\npreferred stock that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction\nthat might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nRestrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares may restrict change of control or business combination\nopportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares.\nIn order for us to qualify as a REIT for each taxable year after our taxable year ended December 31, 2013,\nno more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or constructively, by five or fewer\nindividuals during the last half of any calendar year, and at least 100 persons must beneficially own our shares during\nat least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year.\n“Individuals” for this purpose include natural persons, private foundations, some employee benefit plans and trusts,\nand some charitable trusts. Our charter contains, among other things, such customary provisions related to our current\noperation as a REIT and such other provisions that are consistent with the corporate governance profile of our public\npeers, including certain customary ownership limitations that prohibit, among other limitations, any person from\nbeneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive,\nof the outstanding share of our common stock or all classes and series of our capital stock. These ownership limits\nand the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares in our charter could have the effect of discouraging\n22\na takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over\nthe then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests.\nRisks Related to Our Debt Financings\nDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms or at all\nand have other adverse effects.\nUncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to\nrefinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms (or at all), which may negatively affect our ability to make\nacquisitions. A downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive\nfinancing, and may require us to adjust our business plans accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more\ndifficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as\nprospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing.\nWe depend on external sources of financing that are outside of our control, which could adversely affect our ability\nto acquire or redevelop properties, satisfy our debt obligations and/or make distributions to stockholders.\nWe depend on external sources of financing to acquire properties, to satisfy our debt obligations and to make\ndistributions to our stockholders required to maintain our qualification as a REIT, and these sources of financing may\nnot be available on favorable terms, or at all. Our access to external sources of financing depends on a number of\nfactors, including the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and\nour ability to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we are unable to obtain external\nsources of financing, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, satisfy our debt\nobligations or make cash distributions to our stockholders that would permit us to qualify as a REIT or avoid paying\nU.S. federal income tax on all of our net taxable income.\nThe terms and covenants relating to our indebtedness could adversely impact our economic performance.\nThe Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents contain (and any new or amended\nloan and/or facility we may enter into from time to time will likely contain) customary affirmative and negative\ncovenants, including financial covenants that, among other things, require us to comply with a minimum net worth\n(as defined in the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents) of at least the outstanding\nprincipal balance of the Term Loan and a minimum liquidity standard of at least 10% of the outstanding principal\nbalance of the term loan (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents and Term Loan Documents). In\nthe event that we fail to satisfy our covenants, we would be in default under the Amended Credit Facility Loan\nDocuments and Term Loan Documents and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under\nsuch circumstances, other sources of debt or equity capital may not be available to us, or may be available only on\nunattractive terms. Moreover, the presence of such covenants could cause us to operate our business with a view\ntoward compliance with such covenants, which might not produce optimal returns for stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Qualification as a REIT\nOur failure to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT would subject us to U.S. federal income tax and applicable\nstate and local taxes, which would reduce the amount of operating cash flow available for distribution to\nstockholders.\nWe have elected, and believe that we have been qualified, to be taxed as a REIT commencing with the taxable\nyear ended December 31, 2013. Qualification for treatment as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and\nextremely complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The\ndetermination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to\nqualify for REIT treatment. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet, on an ongoing basis through actual operating results,\nvarious tests regarding the nature and diversification of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding\nshares and the amount of our distributions. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements\nalso depends upon our ability to manage successfully the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis.\nOur ability to satisfy these asset tests depends upon an analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our\nassets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent\n23\nappraisals. In addition, we have held and may continue to hold investments in other publicly traded REITs. If any such\npublicly traded REIT fails to qualify as a REIT with respect to any period during which we hold or have held shares\nof such REIT, or if our interests in these REITs are otherwise not treated as equity in a REIT for U.S. federal income\ntax purposes, our ability to satisfy the REIT requirements could be adversely affected. Moreover, new legislation,\ncourt decisions or administrative guidance may, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, make it more difficult\nor impossible for us to qualify as a REIT. Thus, while we believe that we have been organized and operated and intend\nto operate so that we will continue to qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs,\nthe ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no\nassurance can be given that we have qualified or will so qualify for any particular year. These considerations also\nmight restrict the types of assets that we can acquire or services that we can provide in the future. We have not\nrequested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS regarding our qualification as a REIT.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, among other requirements, we must ensure that at least 75% of our gross\nincome for each taxable year, excluding certain amounts, is derived from certain real property-related sources, and at\nleast 95% of our gross income for each taxable year, excluding certain amounts, is derived from certain real property-\nrelated sources and passive income such as dividends and interest. For purposes of these rules, income from the rental\nof real property is generally treated as qualifying income, whereas service income is generally treated as nonqualifying\nincome. Furthermore, for purposes of these rules, services provided to tenants at a property could cause all income\nfrom the property to be nonqualifying if the income from such services, or the costs of providing those services, exceed\ncertain thresholds. We have provided and may continue to provide certain services to our tenants, such as access to\ninsurance. We believe that these services have been provided in a manner that does not cause our rental income to fail\nto be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. However, if the IRS were to\nsuccessfully challenge our characterization of these services, our qualification as a REIT could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, where we have provided services that may generate nonqualifying income, we believe the income\nattributable to these services and the costs of providing these services are sufficiently small so as not to cause us to\nfail to satisfy the REIT gross income tests. However, there is limited guidance regarding what costs are taken into\naccount for this purpose. If the IRS were to successfully assert that our income from these services or the costs of\nproviding these services exceeded certain thresholds, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIf we fail to qualify for treatment as a REIT at any time and do not qualify for certain statutory relief\nprovisions, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income, and possibly could be required\nto borrow money or sell assets to pay that tax, thus substantially reducing the funds available for distribution for each\nyear involved. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be disqualified from\ntreatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost our qualification. In addition,\nall distributions to stockholders, including capital gain dividends, would be subject to tax as regular dividends to the\nextent of our earnings and profits.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nEven though we believe that we currently qualify for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a REIT, we may\nface tax liabilities that will reduce our cash flow, including taxes on any undistributed income, state or local income\nand property and transfer taxes, including real property transfer taxes. In addition, we could, in certain circumstances,\nbe required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief\nprovisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Any of these taxes would decrease operating cash\nflow to our stockholders. In addition, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avert the imposition\nof a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory, we hold some of our\nassets and provide certain services to our tenants through one or more TRSs, or other subsidiary corporations that will\nbe subject to corporate-level income tax at regular corporate rates. Any TRSs or other taxable corporations in which\nwe invest will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate taxes. Furthermore, if we acquire appreciated assets\nfrom a corporation that is or has been a subchapter C corporation in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of\nsuch assets in the our hands is less than the fair market value of the assets, determined at the time we acquired such\nassets, and if we subsequently dispose of any such assets during the 5-year period following the acquisition of the\nassets from the C corporation, we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain from the\ndisposition of such assets to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the assets on the date that we acquired\nsuch assets over the basis of such assets on such date, which are referred to as built-in gains. Payment of these taxes\ngenerally could materially and adversely affect our income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition,\nliquidity and prospects, and could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the ability to make distributions\nto stockholders.\n24\nTo maintain our REIT qualification, we may be forced to borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions.\nIn order to maintain our REIT qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, we may need\nto borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not\nfavorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from, among other things, timing differences\nbetween the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-\ndeductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. These sources,\nhowever, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a\nnumber of factors, including the market’s perception of our growth potential, current debt levels, the per share trading\nprice of our common stock, and our current and potential future earnings. We cannot assure you that we will have\naccess to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause us to curtail investment\nactivities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results\nof operations, cash flows and our ability to pay distributions on, and the per share trading price of, our common stock.\nFailure to make required distributions would subject us to tax, which would reduce the operating cash flow\navailable for distribution to stockholders.\nFailure to make required distributions would subject us to tax, which would reduce the operating cash flow\nto our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders each calendar year at least\n90% of our net taxable income (excluding net capital gain). To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution\nrequirement, but distribute less than 100% of our net taxable income (including net capital gain), we would be subject\nto U.S. federal corporate income tax on our undistributed net taxable income. In addition, we will incur a 4% non-\ndeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum\namount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. Although we intend to distribute our net taxable income to our\nstockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the REIT 90% distribution requirement and to avoid the 4% non-\ndeductible excise tax, it is possible that we, from time to time, may not have sufficient cash to distribute 100% of our\nnet taxable income. There may be timing differences between our actual receipt of cash and the inclusion of items in\nour income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to\ndistribute net taxable income to stockholders in a manner that satisfies the REIT distribution requirements and avoids\nthe 4% non-deductible excise tax.\nComplying with the REIT requirements may cause us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal tax purposes, we must continually satisfy various requirements\nconcerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts\nwe distribute to our stockholders, and the ownership of shares. Among other requirements, to qualify as a REIT, we\nmust satisfy certain annual gross income tests and we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least\n75% of the value of our total assets consists of cash, cash items, U.S. government securities and qualified real estate\nassets. The remainder of our investment in securities generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting\nsecurities of any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs\nand qualified real estate assets) or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer\n(other than government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets).\nIn addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer (other\nthan U.S. government securities, securities of corporations that are treated as TRSs and qualified real estate assets),\nno more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and no more\nthan 25% of the value of our assets can consist of debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs that are not\notherwise secured by real property. If we fail to comply with these asset requirements at the end of any calendar\nquarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory\nrelief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences.\nTo meet these tests, we may be required to take or forgo taking actions that we would otherwise consider\nadvantageous. For instance, in order to satisfy the gross income or asset tests applicable to REITs under the Code, we\nmay be required to forgo investments that we otherwise would make. Furthermore, we may be required to liquidate\nfrom our portfolio otherwise attractive investments. In addition, we may be required to make distributions to\nstockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution. These actions\ncould reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to stockholders. Thus, compliance with the REIT\nrequirements may hinder our investment performance.\n25\nWe may be subject to a 100% tax on income from “prohibited transactions,” and this tax may limit our ability to\nsell assets or require us to restructure certain of our activities in order to avoid being subject to the tax.\nWe are subject to a 100% tax on any income from a prohibited transaction. “Prohibited transactions”\ngenerally include sales or other dispositions of property (other than property treated as foreclosure property under the\nCode) that is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by a\nREIT, either directly or indirectly through certain pass-through subsidiaries. The characterization of an asset sale as a\nprohibited transaction depends on the particular facts and circumstances.\nThe 100% tax will not apply to gains from the sale of inventory that is held through a TRS or other taxable\ncorporation, although such income will be subject to tax in the hands of the corporation at regular corporate income\ntax rates. We have sold items such as locks, boxes, and packing materials to tenants and third parties directly rather\nthan through a TRS, and as a result could be liable for this tax with respect to these sales. To the extent that we continue\nto sell such inventory items, other than through a TRS, we may be subject to this 100% tax.\nOur TRSs will be subject to U.S. federal income tax and will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain\nincome or deductions if transactions with such TRSs are not conducted on arm’s length terms.\nWe conduct certain activities (such as selling packing supplies and locks and renting trucks or other moving\nequipment) through one or more TRSs.\nA TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has\nmade a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a TRS. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power\nor value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS.\nOther than some activities relating to lodging and health care properties, a TRS may generally engage in any business,\nincluding the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A TRS is subject to\nU.S. federal income tax as a regular C corporation.\nNo more than 20% of the value of a REIT’s total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more\nTRSs. This requirement limits the extent to which we can conduct our activities through TRSs. The values of some of\nour assets, including assets that we hold through TRSs, may not be subject to precise determination, and values are\nsubject to change in the future. In addition, the Code imposes a 100% tax on certain transactions between a TRS and\nits parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis. We intend to structure transactions with any TRS on\nterms that we believe are arm’s length to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no\nassurances, however, that we will be able to avoid application of the 100% tax.\nWe may not have cash available to make distributions.\nOur taxable income may exceed our cash flow for a year, which could necessitate our borrowing funds and/or\nsubject us to tax, thus reducing the cash available for distribution to our stockholders. We intend to make cash\ndistributions each year sufficient to satisfy REIT distribution requirements and to avoid liability for the REIT excise\ntax. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to do so. Our taxable income may substantially exceed\nour net income as determined based on GAAP, as well as our cash flow, because, for example, realized capital losses\nwill be deducted in determining GAAP net income but may not be deductible in computing taxable income or because\nwe acquired assets that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding\ncash flow from the assets. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “TCJA”), which was signed into law on\nDecember 22, 2017, we generally will be required to recognize certain amounts in income no later than the time such\namounts are reflected on our financial statements. Also, in certain circumstances our ability to deduct interest expenses\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited by provisions of the TCJA. If the cash flow we generate in a\nparticular year is less than our taxable income, we may be required to use cash reserves, incur short-term, or possibly\nlong-term, debt or liquidate non-cash assets at rates or at times that are unfavorable in order to make the necessary\ndistributions.\nOur REIT qualification could be adversely affected by the REIT qualification of any REIT in which we hold an\ninterest.\nIn connection with our conversion from a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) to a REIT, we disposed\nof the majority of our assets and acquired government securities and shares of publicly traded REITs. As a result, our\nqualification as a REIT has depended on the REIT qualification of the publicly traded REITs in which we have\ninvested. Furthermore, we may continue to hold interests in publicly traded REITs, and as a result our REIT\nqualification may continue to depend on the REIT qualification of any publicly traded REITs in which we continue to\n26\nhold an interest. We do not generally independently investigate the REIT qualification of such REITs, but rather\ngenerally rely on statements made by such REITs in their public filings. In the event that one or more of the publicly\ntraded REITs in which we invested was not properly treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or if our\ninterests in these REITs were otherwise not treated as equity in a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is\npossible that we may not have met certain of the REIT asset and income requirements, in which case we could have\nfailed to qualify as a REIT. Similarly, if we hold an interest in a publicly traded REIT in the future that fails to qualify\nas a REIT, such failure could adversely impact our REIT qualification.\nWe could fail to qualify as a REIT if we have not distributed any earnings and profits attributable to a taxable year\nbefore we elected to be taxed as a REIT.\nA corporation does not qualify as a REIT for a given taxable year if, as of the final day of the taxable year,\nthe corporation has any undistributed earnings and profits that accumulated during a period that the corporation was\nnot treated as a REIT. Because we were not treated as a REIT for our entire existence (such period prior to our election\nto be taxed as a REIT, the “Pre-REIT period”), it is possible that we could have undistributed earnings and profits\nfrom the Pre-REIT period, in which case we would be required to pay a deficiency dividend in order to comply with\nthis requirement or could fail to qualify as a REIT. We believe that, since December 31, 2013, we have not had any\nearnings and profits accumulated from the Pre-REIT period because all such earnings and profits were distributed\nprior to December 31, 2013. In particular, prior to December 31, 2013, we believe that we qualified as a RIC for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, and as a RIC, we distributed our earnings on an annual basis in order to avoid being\nsubject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed earnings. However, if it is determined that we have\naccumulated earnings and profits from the Pre-REIT period, we could be required to pay a deficiency dividend to\nstockholders after the relevant determination in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, or we could fail to\nqualify as a REIT.\nWe may not have satisfied requirements related to the ownership of our outstanding stock, which could cause us\nto fail to qualify as a REIT.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly\nor indirectly, through the application of certain attribution rules under the Code, by five or fewer individuals, as defined\nin the Code to include specified entities, during the last half of any taxable year other than the first taxable year during\nwhich we qualified as a REIT (the “5/50 Test”). Prior to October 20, 2017, our charter did not contain customary\nREIT ownership restrictions and therefore did not ensure that we satisfied the 5/50 Test. Effective as of October 20,\n2017, our charter was revised to include, among other things, certain customary ownership limitations that prohibit,\namong other limitations, any person from beneficially or constructively owning more than 9.8% in value or in number\nof shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding share of our common stock or all classes and series of our\ncapital stock. These provisions are intended to assist us in satisfying the 5/50 Test. With respect to the period between\nJanuary 1, 2013 and October 20, 2017, we monitored purchases and transfers of shares of our common stock by\nregularly reviewing, among other things, ownership filings required by the federal securities laws to monitor the\nbeneficial ownership of our shares in an attempt to ensure that we met the 5/50 Test. However, the attribution rules\nunder the Code are broad, and we may not have had the information necessary to ascertain with certainty whether or\nnot we satisfied the 5/50 Test during such period. As a result, no assurance can be provided that we satisfied the 5/50\nTest during such period. If it were determined that we failed to satisfy the 5/50 Test, we could fail to qualify as a REIT\nor, assuming we qualify for a statutory relief provision under the Code, be required to pay a penalty tax.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax\nliabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under these\nprovisions, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge interest rate risk will be excluded from\ngross income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests if (i) the instrument (a) hedges interest rate\nrisk on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets or (b) hedges an instrument described in clause (a) for a\nperiod following the extinguishment of the liability or the disposition of the asset that was previously hedged by the\nhedged instrument, and (ii) the relevant instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury regulations.\nIncome from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute non-qualifying income\nfor purposes of both the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our\nuse of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could\nincrease the cost of our hedging activities because our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater\nrisks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in our TRS\n27\nwill generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried back or forward against past or future taxable\nincome in the TRS.\nLegislative or regulatory tax changes related to REITs could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations governing REITs and their stockholders, as well as the\nadministrative interpretations of those laws and regulations, are constantly under review and may be changed at any\ntime, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given as to whether, when, or in what form, the U.S. federal\nincome tax laws applicable to us and our stockholders may be enacted. Changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws\nand interpretations of U.S. federal tax laws could adversely affect an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe future sales of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock and dilute stockholders’\nbeneficial ownership.\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares of\nour common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the market price of our common stock. Any sales of a\nsubstantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur,\nmay cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, future issuances of our common stock may\nbe dilutive to existing stockholders.\nAny future offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity\nsecurities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation,\nmay adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may increase our capital resources by making offerings of debt or preferred equity securities,\nincluding trust preferred securities, senior or subordinated notes and preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our\ndebt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of\nour available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of\nour existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock, or both. Holders of our common stock are\nnot entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Because our decision to issue securities in any\nfuture offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate\nthe amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings\nreducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may vary substantially.\nOur common stock is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol “SELF.” The stock markets, including NASDAQ,\nhave experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over the past several years. As a result, the market price\nof our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease\nin the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Accordingly, no\nassurance can be given as to the ability of our stockholders to sell their common stock or the price that our stockholders\nmay obtain for their common stock.\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock include:\n• our actual or projected operating results, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity or changes in\nbusiness strategy or prospects;\n• actual or perceived conflicts of interest with our directors, officers and employees;\n• equity issuances by us, or share resales by our stockholders, or the perception that such issuances or\nresales may occur;\n• the impact of accounting principles and policies on our financial positions and results;\n• publication of research reports about us or the real estate industry;\n28\n• changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n• adverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n• additions to or departures of our key personnel;\n• speculation in the press or investment community;\n• our failure to meet, or the lowering of, our earnings estimates or those of any securities analysts;\n• increases in market interest rates, which may lead investors to demand a higher distribution yield\nfor our common stock and would result in increased interest expenses on our debt;\n• failure to maintain our REIT qualification or exclusion from registration under the 1940 Act, as\namended;\n• price and volume fluctuations in the stock market generally; and\n• general market and economic conditions, including the current state of the credit and capital\nmarkets.\nMarket factors unrelated to our performance could also negatively impact the market price of our common\nstock. One of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our\ndistribution rate as a percentage of our stock price relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates increase,\nprospective investors may demand a higher distribution rate or seek alternative investments paying higher dividends\nor interest. As a result, interest rate fluctuations and conditions in capital markets can affect the market value of our\ncommon stock. For instance, if interest rates rise, it is likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease\nas market rates on interest-bearing securities increase.\nItem 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nCAUTIONARY LANGUAGE\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated historical\nfinancial data together with the consolidated pro forma financial data and historical financial statements and related\nnotes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. We make statements in this section that may be forward-looking\nstatements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements,\nsee the section in this annual report entitled “Statement on Forward-looking Information.”\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated\nfinancial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Our notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained\nelsewhere in this annual report describe the significant accounting policies essential to our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements. Preparation of our financial statements requires estimates, judgments and assumptions. We\nbelieve that the estimates, judgments and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on\ninformation available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect our reported\nassets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during\nthe period presented. If there are material differences between these estimates, judgments and assumptions and actual\nfacts, our financial statements may be affected.\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does\nnot require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available\nalternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting\namong available alternatives would produce a materially different result. See the notes to the condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements that contain additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis Overview\nThe Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and\nredevelops self storage properties (“stores” or “properties”) in the United States. Our stores are designed to offer\naffordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company owned and operated, or managed, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores located\nin Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company was\nformerly registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) as a non-diversified,\nclosed end management investment company. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) order approving\nthe Company’s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. On January 19, 2016,\nthe Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration\nfrom an investment company to an operating company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended (the “Exchange Act”), and listed its common stock on NASDAQ under the symbol “SELF”.\nThe Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company\nhas elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To the extent\nthe Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, with certain\nlimited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.\nOur store operations generated most of our net income for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, a\nsignificant portion of management’s time is devoted to seeking to maximize cash flows from our existing stores, as\nwell as seeking investments in additional stores. The Company expects to continue to earn a majority of its gross\nincome from its store operations as its current store operations continue to develop and as it makes additional store\nacquisitions. Over time, the Company expects to divest its remaining portfolio of investment securities and use the\nproceeds to acquire and operate additional stores. The Company expects its income from investment securities to\ncontinue to decrease as it continues to divest its holdings of investment securities.\n34\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our\nstockholders. For future acquisitions, the Company may employ various financing and capital raising alternatives\nincluding, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with\nthird parties.\nOn June 24, 2016, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company (“Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries”)\nentered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the “Term Loan Agreement”)\nbetween the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the “Term Loan Lender”).\nUnder the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from Term Loan Lender the principal\namount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Term Loan Promissory Note”). The Term Loan Promissory\nNote bears interest at a rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security\nagreement (the “Term Loan Security Agreement”), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by\ncertain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc.\nacted as Special Purpose Vehicle Agent of the Term Loan Lender. The Company entered into a non-recourse guaranty\n(the “Term Loan Guaranty” and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the\nTerm Loan Security Agreement, the “Term Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Term Loan Lender of\ncertain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement. We have used some of\nthe proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to acquire four self storage properties in 2016.\nOn December 20, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (“Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”)\nentered into a revolving credit loan agreement (collectively, the “Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Credit\nFacility Secured Subsidiaries and TCF National Bank (“Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Credit Facility Loan\nAgreement, the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Credit Facility Lender in the principal\namount of up to $10 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Credit Facility\nPromissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3.00% over the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered\nRate and was due to mature on December 20, 2021. The obligations under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement are\nsecured by certain real estate assets owned by the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. We entered into a guaranty of\npayment on December 20, 2018 (the “Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Credit Facility Loan Agreement,\nthe Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the\npayment to the Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the\nCredit Facility Loan Agreement. As described in more detail below, the Credit Facility Loan Agreement has been\nreplaced in its entirety by the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement (as defined below) on July 6, 2021.\nOn December 18, 2019, we completed a rights offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,601,291\nshares of our common stock (“common stock”) at the subscription price of $4.18 per whole share of common stock,\npursuant to the exercise of subscriptions and oversubscriptions from our stockholders. We raised aggregate gross\nproceeds of approximately $6.7 million in the rights offering.\nOn May 19, 2020, an affiliate of the Company (the “Borrower”) entered into a Paycheck Protection Program\nTerm Note (“PPP Note”) with Customers Bank on behalf of itself, the Company, and certain other affiliates under the\nPaycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”)\nadministered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The Borrower received total proceeds of\n$486,602 from the PPP Note. On April 5, 2022, the Borrower was granted forgiveness of the entire PPP Note and any\naccrued interest. Upon forgiveness, the Company received $307,210 in cash from the Borrower, which was the amount\nattributable to the Company under the SBA's loan determination formula, and recorded a gain for such amount in its\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\nOn June 25, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of\n1,121,496 shares of our common stock at the price of $5.35 per share. Subsequently, the over-allotment option was\nexercised increasing the total number of shares sold and issued to 1,289,720. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of\napproximately $6.9 million in the public offering after giving effect to the exercise of the over-allotment option.\n35\nOn July 6, 2021, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) of the\nCompany entered into a first amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Agreement”) between the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National\nBank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (“Amended Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Amended Credit\nFacility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million, reduced to $14.75 million and $14.5 million in years 2\nand 3, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the “Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Amended\nCredit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month U.S. Dollar\nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate or 0.25% and is due to mature on July 6, 2024. The Company is considering, among\nother things, refinancing or finding a suitable replacement for the revolving line of credit in light of its upcoming\nmaturity. The publication of LIBOR ceased after June 30, 2023. The Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement\nprovides for a replacement index based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The interest rate on the\nAmended Credit Facility Promissory Note subsequent to June 30, 2023, is equal to 3% plus the greater of SOFR plus\n0.11448% or 0.25%. As of December 31, 2023, the effective interest rate was 8.46%. The obligations under the\nAmended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Amended Credit\nFacility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into an amended and restated guaranty of payment on July 6,\n2021 (“Amended Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the\nAmended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents”)\nto guarantee the payment to the Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Amended Credit Facility\nSecured Subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Amended Credit\nFacility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Documents. The Company also maintains a bank account at the Amended Credit Facility Lender. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we have not withdrawn proceeds under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We\ncurrently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement to\nfund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our\nportfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales\nAgreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time,\nshares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to\n$15,000,000, through the Agent. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, under the Sales Agreement,\nthe Company sold and issued an aggregate of 373,833 shares of common stock and raised aggregate gross proceeds\nof approximately $2,272,628, less sales commissions of approximately $45,491 and other offering costs resulting in\nnet proceeds of $2,008,436. There were no shares of common stock sold during the three and twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 under the Sales Agreement.\nWe continue to actively review a number of store and store portfolio acquisition opportunities and have been\nworking to further redevelop and expand our current stores. We did not make any acquisitions in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. In addition, we may pursue third-party management opportunities of properties owned by certain\naffiliates or joint venture partners for a fee, and utilize such relationships with third-party owners as a source for future\nacquisitions and investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2023, we managed one third-party owned property,\nwhich was previously rebranded as “Global Self Storage,” had 137,318-leasable square feet and was comprised of\n619 climate-controlled and non-climate-controlled units located in Edmond, Oklahoma.\nIn addition to actively reviewing a number of store and portfolio acquisition opportunities, we have been\nworking to further redevelop and expand our current stores.\nWe expect we will have sufficient cash from current sources to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve\nmonths because our capital resources currently exceed our projected expenses for the next twelve months. However,\nwe may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our stockholders through the use of\nprudent levels of borrowings. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term\ninvesting and well-aligned with our business plan.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had capital resources totaling approximately $24.3 million, comprised of $7.0\nmillion of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, $2.8 million of marketable securities, and $14.5 million available\nfor withdrawal under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. Capital resources derived from retained cash\n36\nflow have been and are currently expected to continue to be negligible. Retained operating cash flow represents our\nexpected cash flow provided by operating activities, less stockholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain\nstores. The Company's capital resources allow us to continue to execute our strategic business plan, which includes\nfunding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures; expansion projects at our existing properties; and\nbroadening our revenue base and pipeline of potential acquisitions through developing Global MaxManagementSM, our\nthird-party management platform. Our board of directors regularly reviews our strategic business plan, including\ntopics and metrices like capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, funds\nfrom operations (“FFO”) and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) performance, and optimal cash levels.\nWe expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors. Many of the factors that\nwill affect our operating results are beyond our control. The Company and its properties could be materially and\nadversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to, among other things, public health\ncrises, natural disasters and geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine,\nthe ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, financial and credit market volatility and disruptions, inflationary\npressures, rising interest rates, supply chain issues, labor shortages and recessionary concerns.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared with the Year Ended December 31,\n2022\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased from $11,944,850 during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $12,190,715 during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 2.1% or $245,865. Rental income increased from $11,485,511\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022 to $11,719,165 during the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of\n2.0% or $233,654. The increase in total revenues was due primarily to increased rental rates, and the results of our\nproprietary revenue rate management program of raising existing tenant rates.\nOther store related income consists of customer insurance fees, sales of storage supplies, and other ancillary\nrevenues. Other store related income increased from $375,571 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $392,577 in\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 4.5% or $17,006. The increase was primarily attributable to an\nincrease in insurance administration fees at our wholly-owned properties.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal expenses increased from $8,417,660 during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $9,079,462 during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 7.9% or $661,802, which was primarily due to an increase in certain\ngeneral and administrative expenses and store operating expenses. Store operating expenses increased from\n$4,169,182 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $4,549,038 in the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of\n9.1% or $379,856, which was primarily due to increased employment and real estate tax expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization increased from $1,619,239 in the year ended December 31, 2022 to $1,634,044\nin the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 0.9% of $14,805.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $295,401 for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to\nthe year ended December 31, 2022. The change is primarily attributable to an increase in employment expenses.\nBusiness development, capital raising, and store acquisition expenses decreased from $48,340 to $20,080 during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. These costs primarily consisted\nof consulting costs in connection with business development, capital raising, and future potential store acquisitions,\nand expenses related to our third party management platform marketing initiatives. The majority of these expenses are\nnon-recurring and fluctuate based on business development activity during the time period.\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased from $3,527,190 during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $3,111,253 during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 11.8% or $415,937, which was primarily due to increased total\nexpenses.\n37\nOther income (expense)\nInterest expense on loans increased from $780,223 during the year ended December 31, 2022 to $846,406 during\nthe year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 8.5% or $66,183. This increase was attributable to the unrealized\nloss on the mark-to-market of the interest rate cap.\nDividend and interest income was $265,046 during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $120,575\nduring the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was attributable to the dividends earned on money market\nmutual fund balances.\nThe Company recognizes changes in the fair value of its investments in equity securities with readily\ndeterminable fair values in net income and, as such, recorded an unrealized gain of $408,876 for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 compared to an unrealized loss of $1,117,029 during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company had other income of $307,210, attributable to a gain\non the forgiveness of a Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") term note.\nNet income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, net income was $2,938,769 or $0.26 per fully diluted share. For the year\nended December 31, 2022, net income was $2,057,723 or $0.19 per fully diluted share.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National\nAssociation of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance\nby REITs and many REIT analysts. NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT’s net income, excluding gains or losses from\nsales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes unrealized\ngains on marketable equity securities and gains relating to PPP loan forgiveness. FFO and FFO per share are not a\nsubstitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our\nliquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows.\nIn addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.\nHowever, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered\nalong with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company’s\nfinancial statements.\nAdjusted FFO (“AFFO”) and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share\nexcluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs\nand non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company’s operating results. AFFO and AFFO\nper share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow\nin evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our\nstatements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of\noperations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are\nnot indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or\nsimilar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may\nnot compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may\nnot be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that\nto further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash\nflows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company’s financial statements.\n38\nWe believe net operating income or “NOI” is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize\nNOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values,\nevaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In\naddition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate\nvalues and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store\nearnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\nNOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in\nevaluating our operating results.\nSame-Store Self Storage Operations\nWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at\nthe beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has\nachieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of\nsimilar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not\nbeen significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that\nsame-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to\nchanges in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions or\nnew ground-up developments. As of December 31, 2023, we owned twelve same-store properties and zero non-same-\nstore properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with\naccompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating\nexpenses, NOI, etc., stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects\nof non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions or completed developments. Same-store\nresults should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company’s stores\nas a whole.\nSame-store occupancy as of the end of the three months and year ended December 31, 2023 decreased by 30\nbasis points to 89.3% from 89.6% for the same period in 2022. As of March 15, 2024, occupancy at the Company’s\nsame-store properties was 92.1%.\nSame-store revenues decreased by 2.5% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 versus the three months\nended December 31, 2022, and increased by 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023 versus the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Same-store cost of operations increased by 5.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2023\nversus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased by 9.1% for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. Same-store NOI decreased by 7.1% for the three months\nended December 31, 2023 versus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased by 1.7% for the twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in same-store\nNOI was due primarily to an increase in expenses.\nWe believe that our results were driven by, among other things, our internet and digital marketing initiatives\nwhich helped maintain our overall average same-store occupancy of approximately 90% as of December 31, 2023.\nAlso, contributing to our results were our customer service efforts which we believe were essential in building local\nbrand loyalty resulting in powerful referral and word-of-mouth market demand for our storage units and services.\n39\nThese results are summarized as follows:\nSAME - STORE PROPERTIES\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Variance % Change\nRevenues $ 12,111,742 $11,861,082 $ 250,660 2.1%\nCost of operations $ 4,549,038 $ 4,169,182 $ 379,856 9.1%\nNet operating income $ 7,562,704 $ 7,691,900 $ (129,196) -1.7%\nDepreciation and amortization $ 1,449,571 $ 1,433,060 $ 16,511 1.2%\nNet leasable square footage at period end* 830,019 829,448 571 0.1%\nNet leased square footage at period end* 741,248 743,476 (2,228) -0.3%\nOverall square foot occupancy at period end 89.3% 89.6% -0.3% -0.3%\nTotal annualized revenue per leased square foot $ 16.34 $ 15.95 $ 0.39 2.4%\nTotal available leasable storage units* 6,420 6,404 16 0.2%\nNumber of leased storage units 5,589 5,673 (84) -1.5%\nSAME - STORE PROPERTIES\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Variance % Change\nRevenues $2,960,108 $3,037,160 $ (77,052) -2.5%\nCost of operations $1,174,658 $1,115,702 $ 58,956 5.3%\nNet operating income $1,785,450 $1,921,458 $ (136,008) -7.1%\nDepreciation and amortization $ 363,262 $ 358,847 $ 4,415 1.2%\nNet leasable square footage at period end* 830,019 829,448 571 0.1%\nNet leased square footage at period end* 741,248 743,476 (2,228) -0.3%\nOverall square foot occupancy at period end 89.3% 89.6% -0.3% -0.3%\nTotal annualized revenue per leased square foot $ 15.97 $ 16.34 $ (0.37) -2.3%\nTotal available leasable storage units* 6,420 6,404 16 0.2%\nNumber of leased storage units 5,589 5,673 (84) -1.5%\n* From time to time, as guided by market conditions, net leasable square footage, net leased square footage and total\navailable storage units at our properties may increase or decrease as a result of consolidation, division or\nreconfiguration of storage units.

The increase in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023\nwas attributable to, among other things, increased rental rates, and the results of our proprietary revenue rate\nmanagement program of raising existing tenant rates. Same store average overall square foot occupancy for all of the\nCompany’s same-stores combined decreased by 30 basis points to 89.3% in the twelve months ended December 31,\n2023 from 89.6% in the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As of March 15, 2024, occupancy at the Company’s\nsame-store properties was 92.1%.\nWe believe that our focus on maintaining high occupancy helps us to maximize rental income at our properties.\nWe seek to maintain an average square foot occupancy level at or above 90% by regularly adjusting the rental rates\nand promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our online marketing efforts in seeking to generate\nsufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate. Demand may fluctuate due to various local and regional\nfactors, including the overall economy. Demand is generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months\nand, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter\nmonths.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we observed no material degradation in rent collections. However, we believe that\nour bad debt losses could increase from historical levels, due to (i) cumulative stress (such as inflation, COVID-19,\nrecession fears, etc.) on our customers’ financial capacity and (ii) reduced rent recoveries from auctioned units.\nWe may experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty.\nThis could lead to lower occupancies and rent “roll down” as long-term customers are replaced with new customers\nat lower rates.\nWe currently expect rental income growth, if any, to come from a combination of the following: (i) continued\nexisting tenant rent increases, (ii) higher rental rates charged to new tenants, (iii) lower promotional discounts, and\n(iv) higher occupancies. Our future rental income growth will likely also be dependent upon many factors for each\n41\nmarket that we operate in, including, among other things, demand for self storage space, the level of competitor supply\nof self storage space, and the average length of stay of our tenants. Increasing existing tenant rental rates, generally\non an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We typically determine the level of rental increases\nbased upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. We\ncurrently expect existing tenant rent increases for 2024, if any, to be similar to, or slightly greater than, those for the\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nIt is difficult to predict trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents, and occupancy levels. Current\ntrends, when viewed in the short-term, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward\nbecause they may be subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include, among others, initial move-in rates,\nseasonal factors, unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of\nthe tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases\npreviously passed to existing tenants.\nImportantly, we continue to refine our proprietary revenue rate management program which includes regular\ninternet data scraping of local competitors’ prices. We do this in seeking to maintain our competitive market price\nadvantage for our various sized storage units at our stores. This program helps us in seeking to maximize each store’s\noccupancies and our self storage revenue and NOI. We believe that, through our various marketing initiatives, we can\ncontinue to attract high quality, long term tenants who we expect will be storing with us for years. As of December 31,\n2023, our average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.4 years, up from approximately 3.3 years as of\nDecember 31, 2022.\nAnalysis of Same-Store Cost of Operations\nSame-store cost of operations increased 5.3% or $58,956 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 versus\nthe three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased 9.1% or $379,856 for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 versus the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. This increase in same-store cost of\noperations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was due primarily to increased expenses for employment\nand real estate taxes.\nEmployment. On-site store manager, regional manager and district payroll expense increased 3.7% or $12,218\nfor the three months ended December 31, 2023 versus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased 9.3%\nor $113,353 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. This increase\nwas due primarily to routine employee additions and inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing\nemployees. We currently expect inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees and other\nincreases in compensation costs as we potentially add new stores as well as district, regional, and store managers.\nReal Estate Property Tax. Store property tax expense increased 10.4% or $43,611 for the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 versus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased 14.5% or $213,519 for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in property tax\nexpense during the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to increased property assessment valuations and\nthe loss of our Class 8 tax incentive granted to SSG Dolton LLC. See the section titled “Property Tax Expenses at\nDolton, IL” for additional detail. We currently expect same-store property tax expenses to increase during 2024,\nprimarily due to increased property assessment valuations.\nAdministrative. We classify administrative expenses as bank charges related to processing the stores’ cash\nreceipts, credit card fees, repairs and maintenance, utilities, landscaping, alarm monitoring and trash removal.\nAdministrative expenses decreased 10.1% or $19,658 in the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to\nthe same period in 2022, and decreased 5.1% or $43,210 in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared\nto the same period in 2022. We experienced a decrease in administrative expenses for the year ended December 31,\n2023 due primarily to decreased utilities and landscaping expense. Credit card fees increased for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 due to an increase in rental payments received through credit cards, which is one of the results of\nour initiatives in building a higher quality overall tenant base. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct\nstore costs in 2024.\nRepairs and maintenance expense decreased 24.1% or $10,024 for the three months ended December 31, 2023\nversus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and increased 13.9% or $21,612 for the twelve months ended\n42\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. We experienced an increase in repairs and maintenance\nexpense for the year ended December 31, 2023 due primarily to inflation and an increased number of one-off repairs\nin 2023 as compared to 2022.\nOur utility expenses are currently comprised of electricity, oil, and gas costs, which vary by store and are\ndependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and\ntemperature. Also, affecting our utilities expenses over time is our ongoing LED light replacement program at all of\nour stores which has already resulted in lower electricity usage. Utility expense decreased 10.2% or $5,731 for the\nthree months ended December 31, 2023 versus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased 4.2% or\n$11,293 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to\nlower energy usage during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2023 versus the same periods in 2022. It\nis difficult to estimate future utility costs because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and\nunpredictable. However, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity rates, we\ncurrently expect inflationary increases in rates combined with lower usage resulting in higher net utility costs in 2024.\nLandscaping expenses, which include snow removal costs, decreased 19.2% or $5,685 for the three months\nended December 31, 2023 versus the three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased 43.0% or $74,916 in the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in landscaping expense\nin the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 versus the same period in 2022 is primarily due to lower snow removal\ncosts. Landscaping expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact\nlandscaping needs including, among other things, snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random\nevents. We currently expect inflationary increases in landscaping expense in 2024, excluding snow removal expense,\nwhich is primarily weather dependent and unpredictable.\nMarketing. Marketing expense is comprised principally of internet advertising and the operating costs of our\n24/7 kiosk and telephone call and reservation center. Marketing expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels,\nand other factors. Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short term in response\nto these factors. Marketing expense decreased 7.8% or $6,862 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 versus\nthe three months ended December 31, 2022, and decreased 14.6% or $43,131 for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease in marketing expense in the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023 versus the same period in 2022 is primarily due to decreased marketing costs and internet\nadvertising expenses during the year ended 2023. Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies,\nwe currently expect marketing expense to increase in 2024.\nGeneral. Other direct store costs include general expenses incurred at the stores. General expenses include\nitems such as store insurance, business license costs, and the cost of operating each store’s rental office including\nsupplies and telephone and data communication lines. General expenses increased 33.4% or $27,522 in the three\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, and increased 10.8% or $34,330 in the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased insurance\nexpense. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct store costs in 2024.\nLien Administration. Lien administration expenses increased 64.9% or $2,126 in the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, and increased 51.1% or $6,751 in the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022.\nProperty Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL\nLate in the third quarter of 2017, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed by the municipality and separately, our\nClass 8 tax incentive renewal hearing was held. As a result of those two events, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed\nat approximately 52% higher and the Class 8 tax incentive was not renewed. These events were applied retroactively\nto take effect on January 1, 2017. Property tax expenses have increased to $399,000 during 2020, $417,000 during\n2021, $532,000 during 2022, and $559,000 during 2023. The Class 8 tax incentive phased out over the years 2017,\n2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Both the property tax reassessment and our Class 8 tax incentive renewal status are\ncurrently under appeal. However, there is no guarantee that either the assessment will be reduced or our Class 8 tax\nincentive status will be reinstated.\nAnalysis of Global Self Storage FFO and AFFO\n43\nThe following tables present a reconciliation and computation of net income to funds from operations (“FFO”)\nand adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) and earnings per share to FFO and AFFO per share (unaudited):\nThree Months Three Months Twelve Months Twelve Months\nEnded Ended Ended Ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nNet income $ 1,097,400 $ 440,451 $ 2,938,769 $ 2,057,723\nEliminate items excluded from FFO:\nUnrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities (574,142) 227,144 (408,876) 1,117,029\nDepreciation and amortization 409,420 404,897 1,634,044 1,619,239\nGain on Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan\nforgiveness — — — (307,210)\nFFO attributable to common stockholders 932,678 1,072,492 4,163,937 4,486,781\nAdjustments:\nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards 73,324 42,809 199,752 173,921\nBusiness development, capital raising, and property\nacquisition costs 8,928 1,632 20,080 48,340\nAFFO attributable to common stockholders $ 1,014,930 $ 1,116,933 $ 4,383,769 $ 4,709,042\nEarnings per share attributable to common\nstockholders - basic $ 0.10 $ 0.04 $ 0.26 $ 0.19\nEarnings per share attributable to common\nstockholders - diluted $ 0.10 $ 0.04 $ 0.26 $ 0.19\nFFO per share - diluted $ 0.08 $ 0.10 $ 0.38 $ 0.41\nAFFO per share - diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.10 $ 0.40 $ 0.43\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 11,057,928 11,025,477 11,045,699 10,845,884\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 11,096,619 11,071,042 11,087,217 10,900,041\nAnalysis of Global Self Storage Store Expansions\nIn addition to actively reviewing a number of store and portfolio acquisition candidates, we have been working\nto further redevelop and expand our current stores. In 2020, we completed three expansion / conversion projects at\nour properties located in Millbrook, NY, McCordsville, IN, and West Henrietta, NY. In 2021 and 2023, we completed\nconversion projects at our property located in Lima, OH.\nIn 2019, the Company broke ground on the Millbrook, NY expansion, which added approximately 11,800\nleasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units. Upon completion in February 2020, the Millbrook, NY store's area\noccupancy dropped from approximately 88.6% to approximately 45.5%. As of June 30, 2021, the Millbrook, NY\nstore’s total area occupancy was approximately 95.4%.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased space\nto all-climate-controlled units at the McCordsville, IN property. In April 2020, the Company commenced such\nconversion, which resulted in a new total of 535 units and 76,360 leasable square feet at the McCordsville, IN property.\nUpon completion in June 2020, the McCordsville, IN store's total area occupancy dropped from what would have been\napproximately 97.4% to approximately 79.1%. As of June 30, 2021, the McCordsville, IN store’s total area occupancy\nwas approximately 94.7%.\nOur West Henrietta, NY store expansion project, completed in August 2020, added approximately 7,300\nleasable square feet of drive-up storage units. Upon completion of the expansion project, West Henrietta, NY’s total\narea occupancy dropped from approximately 89.6% to approximately 77.9%. As of June 30, 2021, the West Henrietta,\nNY store’s total area occupancy was approximately 89.1%.\n44\nIn 2021, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased spaces to approximately\n3,000 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In July 2021, the Company\ncompleted such conversion, resulting in a new total of 756 units and 96,883 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH\nproperty. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 94.8%. This conversion did not constitute a\nsignificant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of self storage to\nthe property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property.\nIn 2022, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased spaces to approximately\n2,500 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In January 2023, the Company\ncompleted such conversion, resulting in a new total of 767 units and 94,928 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH\nproperty. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 91.1%. This conversion did not constitute a\nsignificant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 2,500 leasable square feet of self storage to\nthe property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property.\nAnalysis of Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\nUnrealized gains/(losses) on the Company’s investment in marketable equity securities for the three and twelve\nmonths ended December 31, 2023 were $574,142 and $408,876, respectively, and for the three and twelve months\nended December 31, 2022 were $(227,144) and $(1,117,029), respectively. As we continue to acquire and/or\nredevelop additional stores, as part of the funding for such activities, we may liquidate our investment in marketable\nequity securities and potentially realize gains or losses. As of December 31, 2023, our cumulative unrealized gain on\nmarketable equity securities was $2,019,542. There were no realized gains or losses for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nNot applicable.\nItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe financial statements are included in this annual report beginning on page F-3.\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere were no disagreements with our accountants on accounting and financial disclosures during the last two\nfiscal years.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports\nwe file pursuant to the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods\nspecified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-\n15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management\nrecognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable\nassurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management\nnecessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures.\nWe have a disclosure controls and procedures committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief\nFinancial Officer, which meets as necessary and is responsible for considering the materiality of information and\ndetermining our disclosure obligations on a timely basis.\n45\nThe disclosure controls and procedures committee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design\nand operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon\nthat evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the\nExchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial\nofficers and effected by our board of directors, audit committee, management and other personnel to provide\nreasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for\nexternal purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, our management\nused criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-\nIntegrated Framework (2013 Framework).\nBased on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over\nfinancial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nChanges in Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-\n15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our fiscal fourth quarter that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B. Other Information.\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement (the\nAgreement\") with its Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark C. Winmill.\nThe Agreement has an initial term of three years and is subject to automatic one-year extensions thereafter,\nunless either party provides at least 90 days’ notice of non-renewal.\nThe Agreement provides for:\n• a monthly base salary of $37,250;\n• eligibility for an annual cash performance bonus based on the satisfaction of performance goals\nestablished by our board of directors or its compensation committee; and\n• participation in benefit plans applicable generally to executive officers.\n46\nThe Agreement provides that, if Mr. Winmill’s employment is terminated by the Company without “cause” or\nby Mr. Winmill for “good reason” (each as defined in the Agreement), or as a result of the Company’s notice of non-\nrenewal of the employment term, Mr. Winmill will be entitled to the following severance payments and benefits,\nsubject to the execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims:\n• accrued but unpaid base salary, bonus and other benefits earned and accrued but unpaid prior to the date\nof termination;\n• an amount equal to three times the sum of Mr. Winmill’s annual base salary plus the greater of the\naverage annual bonus received by Mr. Winmill with respect to the two years prior to the year of\ntermination and Mr. Winmill’s “target” annual bonus; and\n• continued health benefits (including for Mr. Winmill’s dependents) for twenty-four months following\ntermination.\nIn the event Mr. Winmill’s employment terminates by reason of his death or disability he or his estate shall\nreceive:\n• accrued but unpaid base salary, bonus and other benefits earned and accrued but unpaid prior to the date\nof termination;\n• a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the termination occurs; and\n• continued health benefits (including for Mr. Winmill’s dependents) for twenty-four months following\ntermination.\nThe Agreement contains standard confidentiality provisions, which apply indefinitely, and both non-\ncompetition and non-solicitation of employees and customers covenants, which apply during the term of\nemployment and for a period of twelve months thereafter.\nItem 9C.

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and\nthe results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,\nan audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding\nof internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis\nfor our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures\nthat are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex\njudgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\nDallas, Texas\nMarch 26, 2024\nF-2\nGLOBAL SELF STORAGE,

ORGANIZATION\nGlobal Self Storage, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”) is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland\nreal estate investment trust (“REIT”) that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties\n(“stores” or “properties”) in the United States. Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company owns and/or\nmanages 13 self-storage properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,\nand Oklahoma. The Company operates primarily in one segment: rental operations.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in\naccordance with GAAP and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All material\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nThe Company’s cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States and at times\nmay exceed federally insured limits. The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which may include money\nmarket fund shares, with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase, to be cash equivalents. Restricted\ncash is comprised of escrowed funds deposited with a bank relating to capital expenditures.\nThe carrying amount reported on the balance sheet for cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash approximates\nfair value.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in our consolidated\nbalance sheets to the total amount shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 6,921,779 $ 6,363,610\nRestricted cash $ 106,767 151,397\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as shown in our\nconsolidated statements of cash flows $ 7,028,546 $ 6,515,007\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\"). In order to maintain\nits qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable\nincome to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company\nis not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is\ndistributed annually to stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for\ntaxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to\nfail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to federal income tax. In management’s opinion, the requirements\nto maintain these elections are being met. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes.\nThe Company has elected to treat its corporate subsidiary, SSG TRS LLC, as a taxable REIT subsidiary\n(“TRS”). In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and may engage in any real\nestate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to federal and state and local corporate income tax.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is “more likely than\nnot” to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The Company has reviewed its tax positions and has\nconcluded that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded or disclosed related to uncertain tax\nF-7\npositions taken on federal, state, and local income tax returns for open tax years (2020 – 2022), or is expected to be\ntaken in the Company’s 2023 tax returns.\nMarketable Equity Securities\nInvestments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Gains or\nlosses from changes in the fair value of equity securities are recorded in net income, until the investment is sold or\notherwise disposed. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gain or loss on investments\nsold or otherwise disposed.\nFair value is determined using a valuation hierarchy generally by reference to an active trading market, using\nquoted closing or bid prices. Judgment is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in\ndetermining fair values when markets have become inactive.\nReal Estate Assets\nReal estate assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated\nwith the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Property taxes\nand other costs associated with development incurred during a construction period are capitalized. A construction\nperiod begins when expenditures for a real estate asset have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the\nasset for its intended use are in progress. A construction period ends when an asset is substantially complete and ready\nfor its intended use.\nAcquisition costs are generally capitalized for acquisitions that qualify as asset acquisitions. When properties\nare acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non estimated fair values. Allocations to land, building and improvements, and equipment are recorded based upon\ntheir respective fair values as estimated by management.\nIn allocating the purchase price for an acquisition, the Company determines whether the acquisition includes\nintangible assets or liabilities. The Company allocates a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed\nto the value of in-place leases. This intangible is generally amortized to expense over the expected remaining term of\nthe respective leases. Substantially all of the leases in place at acquired properties are at market rates, as the majority\nof the leases are month-to-month contracts.\nRepairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that\nimprove or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation\nis computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which\nare generally between 5 and 39 years.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company carries all derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value of\nderivatives is determined by reference to observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but\ncorroborated by market data. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on\nwhether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. The Company’s use of\nderivative instruments has been limited to an interest rate cap agreement. For derivative instruments not designated as\ncash flow hedges, the unrealized gains and losses are included in interest expense in the accompanying statements of\noperations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the\nderivatives is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s balance sheets\nand subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The valuation analysis of\nF-8\nthe interest rate cap reflects the contractual terms of derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable\nmarket-based inputs, including interest rate curves.\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses primarily consist of property tax accruals, unearned rental income, and\ntrade payables.\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\nRevenues from stores, which are primarily composed of rental income earned pursuant to month-to-month\nleases for storage space, as well as associated late charges and administrative fees, are recognized as earned in\naccordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Promotional discounts reduce rental income over the promotional period.\nAncillary revenues from sales of merchandise and tenant insurance and other income are recognized as earned in\naccordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\").\nThe Company's management fees are earned subject to the terms of the related property management services\nagreements (“PSAs”). These PSAs provide that the Company will perform management services, which include\nleasing and operating the property and providing accounting, marketing, banking, maintenance and other services.\nThese services are provided in exchange for monthly management fees, which are based on a percentage of revenues\ncollected from stores owned by third parties. PSAs generally have original terms of three years, after which\nmanagement services are provided on a month-to-month basis unless terminated. Management fees are due on the last\nday of each calendar month that management services are provided.\nThe Company accounts for the management services provided to a customer as a single performance obligation\nwhich are rendered over time each month in accordance with ASC 606. The total amount of consideration from the\ncontract is variable as it is based on monthly revenues, which are influenced by multiple factors, some of which are\noutside the Company's control. No disaggregated information relating to PSAs is presented as the Company currently\nhas only one contract.\nGeneral and administrative expenses and property operations expenses, which may include among other\nexpenses, property taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other expenses, are expensed as incurred. The\nCompany accrues for property tax expense based upon actual amounts billed and, in some circumstances, estimates\nand historical trends when bills or assessments have not been received from the taxing authorities or such bills and\nassessments are in dispute.\nEvaluation of Asset Impairment\nThe Company evaluates its real estate assets and intangible assets, if any, for indicators of impairment. If there\nare indicators of impairment and we determine that the asset is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows\nto be received through the asset’s remaining life (or, if earlier, the expected disposal date), we record an impairment\ncharge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value or net proceeds from expected\ndisposal.\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually and whenever relevant events, circumstances, and\nother related factors indicate that fair value may be less that carrying amounts. If it is determined that the carrying\namount of goodwill exceeds the amount that would be allocated to goodwill if the reporting unit were acquired for\nestimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded. There were no indicators of impairment to goodwill and real\nestate assets and no impairment charges were recorded during 2023 or 2022.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards to\nemployees and independent directors are based on estimated fair values. Awards granted are measured at fair value\nand any compensation expense is recognized over the service periods of each award. For awards granted which contain\na graded vesting schedule and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized\nas an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award.\nFor awards granted for which vesting is subject to a performance condition, compensation cost is recognized over the\nrequisite service period if and when the Company concludes it is probable that the performance condition will be\nF-9\nachieved. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual\nresults or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative\nadjustment in the period estimates are revised.\nLoan Procurement Costs\nLoan procurement costs on the Company's note payable are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying\namount of the related debt liability. The loan procurement costs related to the note payable are amortized using the\neffective interest method over the life of the loan. If there is not an associated debt liability recorded on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, the costs are recorded as an asset net of accumulated amortization. Loan procurement\ncosts associated with the Company's revolving credit facility remain in line of credit issuance costs, net of amortization\non the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The costs related to the line of credit facility are amortized using the\nstraight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the estimated life of the related debt.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could materially differ from management’s estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). ASU 2020-04 contains\npractical expedients for reference rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases, derivatives and other contracts.\nThe guidance in ASU 2020-04 is optional and may be elected over time as reference rate reform activities occur. ASU\n2020-04 is effective upon issuance, and the provisions generally can be applied prospectively as of January 1, 2020\nthrough December 31, 2024. The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations.\n3. REAL ESTATE ASSETS\nThe carrying value of the Company’s real estate assets is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nLand $ 6,122,065 $ 6,122,065\nBuildings, improvements, and equipment 60,915,497 60,684,393\nSelf storage properties 67,037,562 66,806,458\nLess: accumulated depreciation and amortization (11,556,342) (9,922,298)\nReal estate assets, net $ 55,481,220 $ 56,884,160\nF-10\n4.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company applies the methods of determining fair value to value its financial assets and liabilities. The\napplication of fair value measurements may be on a recurring or nonrecurring basis depending on the accounting\nprinciples applicable to the specific asset or liability or whether management has elected to carry the item at its\nestimated fair value.\nThe hierarchy of valuation techniques is based on whether the inputs to those techniques are observable or\nunobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs\nreflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments or liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other\nmarket participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from\nsources independent of the Company. These may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, interest rates,\nprepayment speeds, credit risk, and market-corroborated inputs.\nLevel 3 — Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or\nobservable inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end\nof the period), unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about\nthe factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability and are based on the best information available\nin the circumstances.\nThis hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs when estimating fair value. The valuation method used to estimate fair value may produce a fair\nvalue measurement that may not be indicative of ultimate realizable value. Furthermore, while management believes\nits valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different\nmethods or assumptions to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate\nof fair value at the reporting date. Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have\nbeen used had a readily available market for such loans or investments existed, or had such loans or investments been\nliquidated, and those differences could be material to the financial statements.\nFair valued assets consist of shares of marketable equity securities and an interest rate cap. The value of the\nequity securities is based on a traded market price and is considered to be a level 1 measurement, and the value of the\ninterest rate cap is based on its maturity, observable market-based inputs including interest rate curves and is\nconsidered to be a level 2 measurement.\nF-11\nThe following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nMarketable equity securities $2,775,029 $ — $ — $2,775,029\nInterest rate cap — 50,881 — 50,881\nTotal assets at fair value $2,775,029 $ 50,881 $ — $2,825,910\nDecember 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nMarketable equity securities $2,366,153 $ — $ — $2,366,153\nInterest rate cap — 123,152 — 123,152\nTotal assets at fair value $2,366,153 $ 123,152 $ — $2,489,305\nThere were no assets transferred from level 1 to level 2 during the years ended December 31, 2023 or\nDecember 31, 2022. The Company did not have any level 3 assets or liabilities as of December 31, 2023 or\nDecember 31, 2022.\nThe fair values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable,\nand accounts payable approximated their respective carrying values as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The aggregate\nestimated fair value of the Company’s debt was $14,956,981 and $15,645,769 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. These estimates were based on market interest rates for comparable obligations, general market\nconditions and maturity.\n6. DERIVATIVES\nThe Company’s objective in using an interest rate derivative is to add stability to interest expense and to manage\nits exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses an interest rate cap to manage\ninterest rate risk. The Company carries the premium paid for the interest rate cap as an asset on the balance sheet at\nfair value. The change in the unrealized gain or loss of the premium is recorded as an increase or decrease to interest\nexpense.\nThe following table summarizes the terms of the Company’s derivative financial instrument:\nNotional Amount Effective Maturity\nProduct December 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 Strike Date Date\nCap Agreement $ 7,500,000 $ 7,500,000 3.75% 12/20/2021 7/6/2024\nThe Company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparty. The\nCompany does not anticipate the counterparty to fail to meet its obligations as they become due.\n7. NOTE PAYABLE AND REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT\nNote Payable\nOn June 24, 2016, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Secured Subsidiaries”) of the Company entered into\na loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) borrowing the principal amount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory\nnote (the “Promissory Note”). The Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 4.192% per annum and matures on\nJuly 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security agreement (the “Security Agreement”), the obligations under the Loan Agreement\nare secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Secured Subsidiaries.\nThe Company entered into a non-recourse guaranty on June 24, 2016 (the “Guaranty,” and together with the\nLoan Agreement, the Promissory Note and the Security Agreement, the “Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment\nto the Lender of certain obligations of the Secured Subsidiaries under the Loan Agreement.\nF-12\nThe Loan Documents require the Secured Subsidiaries and the Company to comply with certain covenants,\nincluding, among others, a minimum net worth test and other customary covenants. The Lender may accelerate\namounts outstanding under the Loan Documents upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Loan\nAgreement) including, but not limited to, the failure to pay amounts due or commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nThe Company incurred loan procurement costs of $646,246 and such costs have been recorded net of the note\npayable on the consolidated balance sheets. The costs are amortized over the term of the loan using the effective\ninterest method and are recorded as an adjustment to interest expense. The Company recorded amortization expense\nof $37,134 and $38,293 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the carrying value of the Company’s note payable is summarized as follows:\nDecember 31,\nNote Payable 2023 December 31, 2022\nPrincipal balance outstanding $ 17,244,687 $ 17,801,456\nLess: Loan procurement costs, net (343,468) (380,602)\nTotal note payable, net $ 16,901,219 $ 17,420,854\nAs of December 31, 2023, the note payable was secured by certain of its self storage properties with an aggregate\nnet book value of approximately $23.9 million. The following table represents the future principal payment\nrequirements on the note payable as of December 31, 2023:\n2024 $ 582,591\n2025 607,488\n2026 633,449\n2027 660,519\n2028 688,746\n2029 and thereafter 14,071,894\nTotal principal payments $ 17,244,687\nRevolving Line of Credit\nOn July 6, 2021, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) of the\nCompany entered into a first amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Agreement”) between the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National\nBank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (“Amended Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Amended Credit\nFacility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Amended Credit\nFacility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million, reduced to $14.75 million and $14.5 million in years 2\nand 3, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the “Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Amended\nCredit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month U.S. Dollar\nLondon Inter-Bank Offered Rate or one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) and is due to mature on July 6, 2024. The\nCompany is considering, among other things, refinancing or finding a suitable replacement for the revolving line of\ncredit in light of its upcoming maturity. The publication of LIBOR ceased immediately after June 30, 2023. The\nAmended Credit Facility Loan Agreement provides for a replacement index based on the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (“SOFR”). The interest rate on the Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note subsequent to June 30, 2023, is\nequal to 3% plus the greater of SOFR plus 0.11448% or 0.25%. As of December 31, 2023 , the effective interest rate\nunder the replacement index was approximately 8.46%. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility Loan\nAgreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The\nCompany entered into an amended and restated guaranty of payment on July 6, 2021 (“Amended Credit Facility\nGuaranty,” and together with the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Promissory\nNote and related instruments, the “Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents” or the “Revolver”) to guarantee the\npayment to the Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Amended Credit Facility Secured\nSubsidiaries under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Amended Credit Facility\nF-13\nSecured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Amended Credit Facility\nLoan Documents.\nThe Revolver requires the Subsidiaries and the Company to comply with certain covenants, including, among\nothers, customary financial covenants. The Lender may accelerate amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents\nupon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Agreement) including, but not limited to, the failure to\npay amounts due to the Lender or commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\nThe Company incurred issuance costs of $231,926 and $477,981 for the July 6, 2021 Revolver extension and\nentry into the Revolver in December 18, 2018, respectively, and such costs are amortized as an adjustment to interest\nexpense using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the loan.\nThe Company recorded amortization expense of $101,602 and $101,602 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. The was no outstanding loan balance under the Revolver as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\n8. LEASES\nGlobal Self Storage as Lessor\nThe Company's property rental revenue is primarily related to rents received from tenants at its operating stores.\nThe Company's leases with its self storage tenants are generally on month-to-month terms, include automatic monthly\nrenewals, allow flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit, and provide for the collection\nof contingent fees such as late fees. These leases do not include any terms or conditions that allow the tenants to\npurchase the leased space. All self-storage leases for which the Company acts as lessor have been classified as\noperating leases. The real estate assets related to the Company's stores are included in \"Real estate assets, net\" on the\nCompany's consolidated balance sheets and are presented at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and\nimpairment, if any. Rental income related to these operating leases is included in property rental revenue on the\nCompany's consolidated statements of operations, and is recognized each month during the month-to-month terms at\nthe rental rate in place during each month.\nGlobal Self Storage as Lessee\nThe Company is a lessee in a lease agreement for an automobile entered into November 2022 with a lease term\nof 3 years. The lease agreement does not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive\ncovenants. As a result of the Company’s election of the package of practical expedients permitted within ASC Topic\n842, which among other things, allows for the carryforward of historical lease classification, all of the Company’s\nlease agreements have been classified as operating leases. Lease expense for payments related to the Company’s\noperating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nRight-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease\nliabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments as specified in the lease. Right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities related to the Company’s operating leases are recognized at the lease commencement date based\non the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an\nimplicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available surrounding the\nCompany’s secured borrowing rates and implied secured spread at the lease commencement date in determining the\npresent value of lease payments. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made at or before lease\ncommencement less any lease incentives. The Company had right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to its\noperating leases of $35,726 and $35,726 as of December 31, 2023 and $54,199 and $54,199 as of December 31, 2022.\nSuch amounts are amortized using a straight-line method over the term of the lease and are included in prepaid\nexpenses and other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets,\nrespectively. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $18,473 and $14,814,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average\ndiscount rate related to its operating leases were approximately 1.8 years and 3.77%, respectively.\nF-14\nThe total lease payments under the automobile lease are $37,031 as of December 31, 2023 and the future\nminimum lease payments are $20,198, and $16,833 for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nF-15\n9. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted earnings\nper share is computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the incremental shares\nattributed to potentially diluted securities. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings\nper share:\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNet income $ 2,938,769 $ 2,057,723\nEarnings and dividends allocated to participating securities (24,425) (23,567)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 2,914,344 $ 2,034,156\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nAverage number of common shares outstanding - basic 11,045,699 10,845,884\nNet effect of dilutive unvested restricted stock awards included for treasury\nstock method 41,518 54,157\nAverage number of common shares outstanding - diluted 11,087,217 10,900,041\nEarnings per common share\nBasic $ 0.26 $ 0.19\nDiluted $ 0.26 $ 0.19\nCommon stock dividends totaled $3,231,608 ($0.29 per share) and $3,019,063 ($0.275 per share) for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nCertain officers and directors of the Company also serve as officers and directors of Winmill & Co. Incorporated\n(“Winco”), Bexil Corporation (“Bexil”), Tuxis Corporation (“Tuxis”), and their affiliates (collectively with the\nCompany, the “Affiliates”). As of December 31, 2023, certain of the Affiliates and the Company's directors and\nemployees may be deemed to own, in aggregate, approximately 8.1% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.\nPursuant to an arrangement between a professional employer organization (“PEO”) and the Affiliates, the PEO\nprovides payroll, benefits, compliance, and related services for employees of the Affiliates in accordance with\napplicable rules and regulations under the Code and, in connection therewith, Midas Management Corporation\n(“MMC”), a subsidiary of Winco, acts as a conduit payer of compensation and benefits to the Affiliates’ employees\nincluding those who are concurrently employed by the Company and its Affiliates. The aggregate compensation and\nbenefits accrued and paid by the Company to MMC were $2,883,067 and $2,465,326 for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Expenses for various concurrently used administrative and support\nfunctions incurred by the Affiliates are allocated at cost among them. The aggregate administrative and support\nfunction expenses accrued and paid by the Company to Winco were $31,243 and $24,183 for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Affiliates participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan for\nsubstantially all qualified employees. A matching expense based upon a percentage of contributions to the plan by\neligible employees is incurred and allocated among the Affiliates. The matching expense is accrued and funded on a\ncurrent basis and may not exceed the amount permitted as a deductible expense under the Code. The Company's\nallocated matching expense was $102,219 and $87,238 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had reimbursements payable to MMC and Winco for compensation,\nbenefits, and administrative and support function expenses of $23,523 and $16,835, respectively.\nF-16\nThe Company currently reimburses monthly automobile expenses of $1,000 per month to its President, Mark\nC. Winmill. To the extent that the monthly payment under the Company’s automobile lease exceeds the current\nmonthly reimbursement amount, Mr. Winmill voluntarily reimburses the Company for the excess amount. In this\nregard, Mr. Winmill has reimbursed the Company $8,198 and $1,878 for the automobile payments paid and due in\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company leases office space and storage to certain Affiliates under rental agreements. The terms of\noccupancy are month to month and automatically renew unless terminated by either party on thirty days’ written\nnotice. The Company earned rental income of $4,800 and $18,000 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\nDuring 2020, MMC (the “Borrower”) entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note (“PPP Note”)\nwith Customers Bank on behalf of itself and the Affiliates under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus\nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the\n“SBA”). The Borrower received total proceeds of $486,602 from the PPP Note of which $307,210 was attributable to\nthe Company under the SBA’s loan determination formula. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act,\nthe Affiliates used the proceeds from the PPP Note primarily for payroll and other eligible costs. On April 5, 2022,\nthe Borrower was granted forgiveness of the entire PPP Note and any accrued interest. Upon forgiveness, the Company\nreceived $307,210 in cash from the borrower, which was the amount attributable to the Company under the SBA's\nloan determination formula, and recorded a gain for such amount, in its consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive income.\n11. CAPITAL STOCK\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company was authorized to issue 450,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value common\nstock of which 11,153,513 shares were issued and outstanding. The Company was also authorized to issue 50,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value, of which none has been issued.\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales\nAgreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time,\nshares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through the Agent. There were no\nshares of common stock sold during the year ended December 31, 2023 under the sales agreement. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, under the Sales Agreement, the Company sold and issued an aggregate of 373,833 shares of\ncommon stock and raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2,272,628, less sales commissions of\napproximately $45,491 and other offering costs resulting in net proceeds of $2,008,436.\n12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nOn October 16, 2017 (“Effective Date”), the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2017 Equity\nIncentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is designed to provide equity-based incentives to certain eligible persons, as\ndefined in the Plan, in the form of options, share appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend\nequivalent rights or other forms of equity-based compensation as determined in the discretion of the Company's board\nof directors, the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors, or other designee thereof. The total\nnumber of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan on the Effective Date was\n760,000.\nThe Company recorded $199,752 and $173,921 of expense in general and administrative expense in its\nconsolidated statements of operations related to restricted stock awards for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $157,097 and $204,806 of unrecognized compensation\nexpense related to unvested time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards, respectively. That cost is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted—average period of 2.1 years and 2.7 years for time-based and performance-\nbased awards, respectively. The fair value of common stock awards is determined based on the closing trading price\nof the Company’s common stock on the grant date.\nF-17\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Grants\nThese time-based grants vest solely based on continued employment, with 6.25% of the shares eligible to vest\non each three-month anniversary of the grant date during the four-year vesting period. Time-based restricted stock\ncannot be transferred during the vesting period. Grants of time-based restricted stock entitle the holder to dividends\npaid by the Company on shares of its common stock, including unvested shares.\nA summary of the Company’s time-based restricted stock grant activity is as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Grants Shares Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2021 61,201 $ 4.45\nGranted 11,000 $ 5.52\nVested (23,645) $ 4.50\nForfeited (3,313) $ 4.74\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 45,243 $ 4.66\nGranted 19,238 $ 5.01\nVested (26,362) $ 4.62\nForfeited (5,019) $ 5.02\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 33,100 $ 4.84\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Grants\nPerformance-based restricted stock grants vest based on continued employment and the achievement of certain\nFunds from Operations, as adjusted (“AFFO”) and same store revenue growth (“SSRG”) goals by the Company during\n2023. Between 0% and 200% of these shares will be earned based on achievement of the AFFO and SSRG goals in\n2023, and the shares which are earned will remain subject to quarterly vesting during the remaining four-year time\nvesting period. Dividends paid by the Company prior to the determination of how many shares are earned will be\nretained by the Company and released only with respect to earned shares. If a Change in Control (as defined in the\nPlan) occurs the number of shares earned will equal the greater of the number of shares granted and the number of\nshares which would have been earned based on the AFFO and SSRG through the date of the Change in Control. If\nfollowing a Change in Control, a grantee is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the grantee with Good\nReason (as each is defined in the Plan), all unvested restricted stock will fully vest. Performance-based restricted stock\nearned during 2023 and 2022 were 30,217 shares and 18,944 shares, respectively.\nA summary of the Company’s performance-based restricted stock grant activity is as follows:\nWeighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nPerformance-based Stock Grants Shares Fair Value\nUnvested at December 31, 2021 22,535 $ 4.34\nGranted 18,944 $ 5.52\nVested (15,588) $ 4.57\nUnvested at December 31, 2022 25,891 $ 5.07\nGranted 30,217 $ 5.11\nVested (16,084) $ 4.96\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 40,024 $ 5.14\nForfeitures are accounted for as they occur, compensation cost previously recognized for an award that is\nforfeited because of a failure to satisfy a service or performance condition is reversed in the period of the forfeiture.\nF-18\n13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which may\nprovide general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as it\ninvolves future claims that may be made against the Company under circumstances that have not occurred.\n14. RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES\nGeneral Market Risks\nThe Company’s portfolio and the success of its investment activities are affected by global and national\neconomic, political and market conditions generally and also by the local economic conditions where its assets are\nlocated. Certain external events such as public health crises, including the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and its\nvariants, natural disasters and geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine\nand the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, have recently led to increased financial and credit market volatility\nand disruptions, leading to record inflationary pressure, rising interest rates, supply chain issues, labor shortages and\nrecessionary concerns. The full impact of such external events on the financial and credit markets and consequently\non the Company’s financial conditions and results of operations is uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. The\nCompany will continue to monitor these events and will adjust its operations as necessary.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk - Financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and\nrestricted cash and certain portions of accounts receivable including rents receivable from our tenants. Risk to\ncollection of rents receivable is mitigated by: (i) dispersion of rents receivable across many tenants, (ii) marketing\ntargeted to tenants that have established credit, (iii) use of autopay, and (iv) use of collection procedures. Cash, cash\nequivalents and restricted cash are on deposit with highly rated commercial banks and financial institutions.\nMarket Risk\nInvestments in securities subject the Company to market risk. Investments in securities may decline in value.\nThe Company monitors the stock prices of the investments and the financial performance of the related companies.\n15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn March 1, 2024, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.0725 per common share payable on March 28,\n2024 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024.\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement with its\nChief Executive Officer and President, Mark C. Winmill.\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company approved restricted share awards under the Plan to certain of its officers and\nemployees in the aggregate amount of 108,374 shares, of which 23,726 shares are performance-based grants and the\nremainder of the shares are time-based grants. Between 0% and 200% of these shares will be earned based on\nachievement of the AFFO and SSRG goals in 2024, and the shares which are earned will remain subject to quarterly\nvesting during the remaining four-year time vesting period.

The quarterly distribution represents an annualized dividend rate of $0.29 per share.\n\n**Company Objective**\n\nThe objective of Global Self Storage is to increase value over time for the benefit of its stockholders. Toward this end, the company will continue to execute its strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures, and expansion projects at its existing properties. The company's board of directors regularly reviews the strategic business plan, with emphasis on capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, FFO and AFFO performance, and optimal cash levels.\n\nThe management of Global Self Storage believes that the company's continued operational performance and capital resources position it well to continue executing its strategic business plan.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n\"In Q3, our same-store revenue growth led our peer group of publicly traded self-storage REITs,\" stated Global Self Storage president and CEO, Mark C. Winmill. \"We also led our peer group in same-store occupancy growth and NOI growth despite a continuing competitive move-in rate environment.\n\n\"We attribute these peer leading results to our targeted digital and local marketing activities that are combined with our operational excellence and professional competitive pricing strategies. These initiatives resulted in overall same-store occupancy at the end of the third quarter increasing by a peer-leading 170 basis points to a 91.5% occupancy rate at the end of the third quarter.\n\n\"This occupancy growth is even more impressive when considering that our marketing expenses decreased by 5.4% in the third quarter versus the same year-ago period. It truly underscores the efficiency and effectiveness of our well-tuned marketing strategies.\n\n\"Our third quarter results also reflect the benefits our newly designed website that we relaunched in Q4 of last year. The redesigned site features an enhanced user interface designed for better visitor engagement and greater attention to our now more than 3,200 tenant reviews that highlight the superior tenant value we deliver.\n\n\"To further strengthen this positive message, during the third quarter we launched a new video reviews section on the [customer reviews](https://pr.report/44if) page of our website. We believe our reviews are a valuable asset that demonstrates the strength of our highly effective customer-focused management approach. Our reviews consistently reflect a high level of satisfaction, with an average rating of more than 4.8 out of 5 stars.\n\n\"While our commitment to exceptional customer service and innovative marketing strategies help garner positive reviews, we believe more importantly these efforts also help us attract high-quality tenants who tend to store with us longer than the industry average. In fact, at the close of the third quarter, our peer-leading same-store average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.4 years, an increase from approximately 3.3 years a year ago.\n\n\"We remain confident that our professional management techniques will continue to maximize revenue and NOI growth in our self storage portfolio. We also believe our pleasant, clean, safe and hassle-free rental process delivers the best customer experience in the industry, and that our proven marketing strategies will continue to draw high-quality tenants that drive favorable stockholder returns.\n\n\"Our strong balance sheet-which includes capital resources totaling approximately $25.1 million-enables us to pursue growth through self-storage property acquisitions, joint ventures, and expansion of existing properties. We continue to explore opportunities in secondary and tertiary markets in select regions of the U.S. and non-U.S. markets. These markets continue to experience limited supply growth as well as less competition from other professionally managed self-storage operators.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect to continue to integrate new technologies that enable us to maximize revenue. We also plan to take further steps to control expenses. We currently believe these efforts will have a positive effect in the current quarter and make an even more meaningful impact in 2025 and beyond.\n\n\"We will remain focused especially on opportunities where we can apply our professional management techniques to optimize occupancy, revenue generation and NOI. Our strong track record of operational performance-even under challenging economic conditions-positions us well to execute our strategic business plan and continue to build value for our stockholders over the long term.\"\n\n**Q3 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nTotal revenues increased 3.6% to $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, with the increase due primarily to increases in occupancy and existing tenant rates under the company's proprietary revenue rate management program. The increase was partially offset by lower move-in rental rates which were in line with lower rates across U.S. markets.\n\nTotal operating expenses increased 2.9% to $2.33 million compared to $2.26 million in the same year-ago period. The increase was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses which resulted from an increase in professional fees and employment costs. The increase in total operating expenses was partially offset by a decrease in store-level operating expenses.\n\nOperating income increased 5.4% to $873,000, as compared to $829,000 in the same period last year, which was primarily due to increased total revenues combined with decreased store operating expenses.\n\nNet income increased to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share from $271,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the same year-ago period. Contributing to the increase was an unrealized gain in marketable equity securities compared to an unrealized loss in the same year-ago period.\n\nCapital resources totaled approximately $25.1 million, comprised of $6.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $3.2 million in marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and $15 million remains available under the company's revolving credit facility.\n\n**Q3 2024 Same-Store Results**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the company owned 12 same-store properties and managed one third party owned property, and there were no non-same-store properties.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, same-store revenues increased 3.6% to $3.2 million compared to the same period last year.\n\nSame-store cost of operations decreased 0.8% to $1.15 million compared to $1.16 million in the same period last year. This decrease in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to decreased expenses for real estate property taxes, and to a lesser extent decreased expenses for repairs and maintenance, administrative, marketing and utilities.\n\nSame-store NOI increased 6.3% to $2.0 million compared to $1.9 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenues and a decrease in cost of operations.\n\nSame-store occupancy at September 30, 2024 increased to 91.5% from 89.8% at September 30, 2023.\n\nSame-store average duration of tenant stay at September 30, 2024 was approximately 3.4 years compared to approximately 3.3 years at September 30, 2023.\n\nFor a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,\" below.\n\n**Q3 2024 Operating Results**\n\nNet income in the third quarter of 2024 increased to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share from $271,000 or $0.02 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nProperty operations expense decreased to $1.15 million from $1.16 million in the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $762,000 from $684,000 in the same period last year.\n\nBusiness development costs decreased to $2,012 for the quarter from $5,903 in the same period last year.\n\nInterest expense increased to $259,000 from $213,000 in the year-ago period. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap and the decrease in cash settlements under the interest rate cap.\n\nFFO was consistent at $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the quarter and in the same period last year.\n\nAFFO increased 2.2% to $1.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share compared to AFFO of $1.1 million or $0.10 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Financial Summary**\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, total revenues increased 1.4% to $9.3 million, as compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to increased occupancies and increases in existing tenant rates under the company's revenue rate management program.\n\nTotal operating expenses in the first nine months of 2024 increased 6.8% to $7.2 million, as compared to $6.8 million in the same period last year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in store level expenses and general and administrative expenses. The increase in store level operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and property insurance.\n\nOperating income decreased 13.6% to $2.1 million in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to $2.4 million in the same period last year.\n\nNet income was $2.0 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2024, as compared to $1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the same period last year.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Same-Store Results**\n\nFor the first nine months of 2024, same-store revenues increased 1.5% to $9.3 million compared to $9.2 million in the same period last year. This increase was due primarily to increased occupancies and increases in existing tenant rates under the company's revenue rate management program.\n\nSame-store cost of operations in the first nine months increased 5.4% to $3.6 million compared to $3.4 million in the same period last year. This increase in same-store cost of operations was due primarily to increased expenses for direct store costs, and to a lesser extent expenses for employment, landscaping, administrative, real estate property tax and lien administration. The increase in same-store cost of operations was partially offset by decreased repairs and maintenance, utilities and marketing expenses.\n\nSame-store NOI decreased 0.7% to $5.74 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $5.78 million in the same period last year. The decrease was primarily due to more muted revenue growth and increased cost of operations.\n\nFor a reconciliation of net income to same-store NOI see, \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Same-Store Net Operating Income,\" below.\n\n**First Nine Months 2024 Operating Results**\n\nNet income in the first nine months of 2024 increased to $2.0 million or $0.18 per diluted share from$1.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nProperty operations expense increased to $3.6 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $3.4 million in the same period last year.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased to $2.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from $2.2 million in the same period last year.\n\nBusiness development costs decreased to $4,287 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $11,152 in the same period last year.\n\nInterest expense for the first nine months of 2024 increased to $676,000 from $620,000 in the year-ago period. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap.

Through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the company owns and/or manages 13 self-storage properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma.\n\nFor more information, go to [ir.globalselfstorage.us](https://pr.report/44ih) or visit the company's customer site at [www.globalselfstorage.us](https://pr.report/44ii).

NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT's net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes changes in unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.\n\nAdjusted FFO (\"AFFO\") and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company's operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company's financial statements.\n\nWe believe net operating income or \"NOI\" is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nNOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.\n\n**Same-Store Self Storage Operations Definition**\n\nWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, or new ground-up developments. At September 30, 2024, we owned 12 same-store properties and zero non same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, and NOI, stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions, or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company's stores as a whole.\n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements**\n\nCertain information presented in this press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the federal securities laws including, but not limited to, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward looking statements include statements concerning the company's plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions, and other information that is not historical information.

All forward-looking statements by the company involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the company, which may cause the company's actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements. The company may also make additional forward-looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by the company or on its behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. Investors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties, and other factors, together with all of the other information included in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and similar information. All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, the company's examination of historical operating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based upon the company's current expectations and various assumptions.

Forward looking statements include statements concerning our plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information. In some cases, forward looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “believes,” “plans,” “intends,” “expects,” “estimates,” “may,” “will,” “should,” or “anticipates” or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy. All forward-looking statements made by the Company involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which may cause the Company’s actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such statements. We may also make additional forward looking statements from time to time. All such subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, by us or on our behalf, are also expressly qualified by these cautionary statements. All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, management’s examination of historical operating trends and estimates of future earnings, are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management’s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved.\n\nAll forward looking statements apply only as of the date made. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward looking statements which may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in or contemplated by this report. Any forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the risks referenced in “Item 1A.

STATEMENTS (Unaudited)\n\n1. ORGANIZATION\n\nGlobal Self Storage, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us”) is a self-administered and self-managed Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties (“stores” or “properties”) in the United States. As of September 30, 2024, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, the Company owned and/or managed 13 self-storage properties in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company operates primarily in one segment: rental operations.\n\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") for interim financial information, and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they may not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the Company’s audited financial statements as of that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n\nThe Company’s cash is deposited with financial institutions located throughout the United States and at times may exceed federally insured limits. Cash equivalents may consist of money market fund shares and may include, among other things, highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less. Restricted cash is comprised of escrowed funds deposited with a bank relating to capital expenditures.\n\nThe carrying amount reported on the balance sheet for cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash approximates fair value.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash in our unaudited consolidated balance sheets to the total amount shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 6,762,074 | $ | 6,921,779  \nRestricted cash | 165,060 | 106,767  \nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as shown in our unaudited consolidated statements of cash flows | $ | 6,927,134 | $ | 7,028,546  \n  \n10\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nThe Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, among other things, the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of its income and assets. As a REIT, the Company is not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of its income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to stockholders. The Company plans to continue to operate so that it meets the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to federal income tax. In management's opinion, the requirements to maintain these elections are being fulfilled. The Company is subject to certain state and local taxes.\n\nThe Company has elected to treat its corporate subsidiary, SSG TRS LLC, as a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). In general, the Company’s TRS may perform additional services for tenants and may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to federal corporate income tax.\n\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities. The Company has reviewed its tax positions and has concluded that no liability for unrecognized tax benefits should be recorded related to uncertain tax positions taken on federal, state, and local income tax returns for open tax years (2021 – 2023), or are expected to be taken in the Company’s 2024 tax returns.\n\nMarketable Equity Securities\n\nInvestments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of equity securities are recorded in net income, until the investment is sold or otherwise disposed. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gain or loss on investments sold or otherwise disposed.\n\nFair value is determined using a valuation hierarchy generally by reference to an active trading market, using quoted closing or bid prices. Judgment is used to ascertain if a formerly active market has become inactive and in determining fair values when markets have become inactive.\n\nReal Estate Assets\n\nReal estate assets are carried at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development, construction, renovation, and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized. Property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during a construction period are capitalized. A construction period begins when expenditures for a real estate asset have been made and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use are in progress. A construction period ends when an asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.\n\nAcquisition costs are generally capitalized for acquisitions that qualify as asset acquisitions. When properties are acquired, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Allocations to land, building and improvements, and equipment are recorded based upon their respective fair values as estimated by management.\n\nIn allocating the purchase price for an acquisition, the Company determines whether the acquisition includes intangible assets or liabilities. The Company allocates a portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset attributed to the value of in-place leases. This intangible is generally amortized to expense over the expected remaining term of the respective leases. Substantially all of the leases in place at acquired properties are at market rates, as the majority of the leases are month-to-month contracts.\n\nRepairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements, which are generally between 5 and 39 years.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company carries all derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value of derivatives is determined by reference to observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship. The Company’s use of derivative instruments has been limited to an interest rate cap agreement. For derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains and losses are included in interest expense in the accompanying statements of operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives is initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s balance sheets and subsequently\n\n11\n\nreclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The valuation analysis of the interest rate cap reflects the contractual terms of derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves.\n\nAccounts Payable and Accrued Expenses\n\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses generally consist of property tax accruals, unearned rental income, and trade payables.\n\nRevenue and Expense Recognition\n\nRevenues from stores, which are primarily composed of rental income earned pursuant to month-to-month leases for storage space, as well as associated late charges and administrative fees, are recognized as earned in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases. Promotional discounts reduce rental income over the promotional period. Ancillary revenues from sales of merchandise and tenant insurance and other income are recognized as earned in accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\").\n\nThe Company's management fees are earned subject to the terms of the related property management services agreements (“PSAs”). These PSAs provide that the Company will perform management services, which include leasing and operating the property and providing accounting, marketing, banking, maintenance and other services. These services are provided in exchange for monthly management fees, which are based on a percentage of revenues collected from stores owned by third parties. PSAs generally have original terms of three years, after which management services are provided on a month-to-month basis unless terminated. Management fees are due on the last day of each calendar month that management services are provided.\n\nThe Company accounts for the management services provided to a customer as a single performance obligation which are rendered over time each month in accordance with ASC 606. The total amount of consideration from the contract is variable as it is based on monthly revenues, which are influenced by multiple factors, some of which are outside the Company's control. No disaggregated information relating to PSAs is presented as the Company currently has only one contract.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses and property operations expenses, which may include among other expenses, property taxes, utilities, repairs and maintenance, and other expenses, are expensed as incurred. The Company accrues for property tax expense based upon actual amounts billed and, in some circumstances, estimates and historical trends when bills or assessments have not been received from the taxing authorities or such bills and assessments are in dispute.\n\nEvaluation of Asset Impairment\n\nThe Company evaluates its real estate assets and intangible assets, if any, for indicators of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment and we determine that the asset is not recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows to be received through the asset’s remaining life (or, if earlier, the expected disposal date), we record an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value or net proceeds from expected disposal.\n\nThe Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually and whenever relevant events, circumstances, and other related factors indicate that fair value may be less that carrying amounts. If it is determined that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the amount that would be allocated to goodwill if the reporting unit were acquired for estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded. There were no indicators of impairment to goodwill and real estate assets as of September 30, 2024, and no impairment charges were recorded for any periods presented herein.\n\nStock-based Compensation\n\nThe measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards to employees and independent directors are based on estimated fair values. Awards granted are measured at fair value and any compensation expense is recognized over the service periods of each award. For awards granted which contain a graded vesting schedule and the only condition for vesting is a service condition, compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period as if the award was, in substance, a single award. For awards granted for which vesting is subject to a performance condition, compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period if and when the Company concludes it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised.\n\nLoan Procurement Costs\n\nLoan procurement costs on the Company's term loan note payable are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. The loan procurement costs related to the term loan note payable are amortized using the effective interest\n\n12\n\nmethod over the life of the loan. Loan procurement costs associated with the Company's revolving line of credit remain in line of credit issuance costs, net of amortization on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The costs related to the revolving line of credit are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the estimated life of the related debt.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from management's estimates.\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amended guidance requires the disclosure of incremental segment information, including significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and a reconciliation of segment profit or loss to net income. The title and position of the CODM must also be disclosed, along with how the CODM uses the reported measures to assess segment performance and to allocate resources. Entities with a single reportable segment (such as the Company) will be required to provide the disclosures required by Topic 280, as amended. The standard became effective for the Company on January 1, 2024 and the required disclosures for the Company will begin with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The adoption and implementation of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n\n3. REAL ESTATE ASSETS\n\nThe carrying value of the Company’s real estate assets is summarized as follows\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nLand | $ | 6,122,065 | $ | 6,122,065  \nBuildings, improvements, and equipment | 60,977,937 | 60,915,497  \nSelf storage properties | 67,100,002 | 67,037,562  \nLess: Accumulated depreciation | (12,781,632 | ) | (11,556,342 | )  \nReal estate assets, net | $ | 54,318,370 | $ | 55,481,220  \n  \n4. MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES\n\nInvestments in marketable equity securities consisted of the following:\n\nGross Unrealized  \n---  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | Cost Basis | Gains | Losses | Value  \nInvestment in marketable equity securities  \nCommon stocks | $ | 755,487 | $ | 2,423,477 | $ | — | $ | 3,178,964  \nTotal investment in marketable equity securities | $ | 755,487 | $ | 2,423,477 | $ | — | $ | 3,178,964  \nGross Unrealized  \nDecember 31, 2023 | Cost Basis | Gains | Losses | Value  \nInvestment in marketable equity securities  \nCommon stocks | $ | 755,487 | $ | 2,019,542 | $ | — | $ | 2,775,029  \nTotal investment in marketable equity securities | $ | 755,487 | $ | 2,019,542 | $ | — | $ | 2,775,029  \n  \n5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nThe Company applies the methods of determining fair value to value its financial assets and liabilities. The application of fair value measurements may be on a recurring or nonrecurring basis depending on the accounting principles applicable to the specific asset or liability or whether management has elected to carry the item at its estimated fair value.\n\n13\n\nThe hierarchy of valuation techniques is based on whether the inputs to those techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 — Prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. These may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, and market-corroborated inputs.\n\nLevel 3 — Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable (for example, when there is little or no market activity for an investment at the end of the period), unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s own assumptions about the factors that market participants use in pricing an asset or liability and are based on the best information available in the circumstances.\n\nThis hierarchy requires the Company to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value. The valuation method used to estimate fair value may produce a fair value measurement that may not be indicative of ultimate realizable value. Furthermore, while management believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those used by other market participants, the use of different methods or assumptions to estimate the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market for such loans or investments existed, or had such loans or investments been liquidated, and those differences could be material to the financial statements.\n\nFair valued assets consist of shares of marketable equity securities and an interest rate cap. The value of the equity securities is based on a traded market price and is considered to be a level 1 measurement, and the value of the interest rate cap is based on its maturity and observable market-based inputs including interest rate curves and is considered to be a level 2 measurement.\n\nThe following table provides the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nAssets  \nMarketable equity securities | $ | 3,178,964 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 3,178,964  \nInterest rate cap derivative | — | 10,768 | — | 10,768  \nTotal assets at fair value | $ | 3,178,964 | $ | 10,768 | $ | — | $ | 3,189,732  \nDecember 31, 2023 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  \nAssets  \nMarketable equity securities | $ | 2,775,029 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 2,775,029  \nInterest rate cap derivative | — | 50,881 | — | 50,881  \nTotal assets at fair value | $ | 2,775,029 | $ | 50,881 | $ | — | $ | 2,825,910  \n  \nThere were no assets transferred from level 1 to level 2 as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not have any level 3 assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2024.\n\nThe fair values of financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their respective carrying values as of September 30, 2024. The estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding debt was approximately $14,466,115 as of September 30, 2024. This estimate was based on market interest rates for comparable obligations, general market conditions, and maturity.\n\n6.DERIVATIVES\n\nThe Company’s objective in using an interest rate derivative is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses an interest rate cap to manage interest rate risk. The Company carries the initial premium paid for the interest rate cap as an asset on the balance sheet at fair value. The change in the unrealized gain or loss of the initial premium is recorded as an increase or decrease to interest expense.\n\nThe following table summarizes the terms of the Company’s derivative financial instrument:\n\n14\n\nNotional Amount | Effective | Maturity  \n---|---|---  \nProduct | September 30, 2024 | Strike | Date | Date  \nCap Agreement | $ | 7,500,000 | 5.25% | 7/10/2024 | 7/6/2027  \nNotional Amount | Effective | Maturity  \nProduct | December 31, 2023 | Strike | Date | Date  \nCap Agreement | $ | 7,500,000 | 3.75% | 12/20/2021 | 7/6/2024  \n  \nThe Company is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the counterparty. The Company does not anticipate the counterparty to fail to meet its obligations as they become due.\n\n7. NOTE PAYABLE AND REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT\n\nNote Payable\n\nOn June 24, 2016, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries”) of the Company entered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the “Term Loan Agreement”) between the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the “Lender”). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from the Lender in the principal amount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Term Loan Promissory Note”). The Term Loan Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security agreement (the “Term Loan Security Agreement”), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company entered into a non-recourse guaranty on June 24, 2016 (the “Term Loan Guaranty,” and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the Term Loan Security Agreement, the “Term Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Lender of certain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement.\n\nThe Term Loan Documents require the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and the Company to comply with certain covenants, including, among others, a minimum net worth test and other customary covenants. The Lender may accelerate amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Documents upon the occurrence of an event of default (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) including, but not limited to, the failure to pay amounts due or commencement of bankruptcy proceedings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\n\nThe Company incurred loan procurement costs of $646,246 and such costs have been recorded as a reduction of the note payable on the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the term of the loan. The Company recorded amortization expense of $8,943 and $9,247 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and $27,060 and $27,962 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s note payable is summarized as follows:\n\nNote Payable | September 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---|---  \nPrincipal balance outstanding | $ | 16,811,550 | $ | 17,244,687  \nLess: Loan procurement costs, net | (316,408 | ) | (343,468 | )  \nTotal note payable, net | $ | 16,495,142 | $ | 16,901,219  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the note payable was secured by certain of the Company’s self storage properties with an aggregate net book value of approximately $23.4million. The following table represents the future principal payment requirements on the note payable as of September 30, 2024:\n\n2024 (3 months) | $ | 147,941  \n---|---|---  \n2025 | 607,488  \n2026 | 633,449  \n2027 | 660,519  \n2028 | 688,746  \n2029 and thereafter | 14,073,407  \nTotal principal payments | $ | 16,811,550  \n  \n15\n\nRevolving Line of Credit\n\nOn July 6, 2024, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) of the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National Bank (\"Huntington\"), successor by merger to TCF National Bank (“Second Amended Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million, reduced to $14.75 million and $14.5 million in years two and three, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the “Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the SOFR or 0.25% and is due to mature on July 6, 2027, with an option to extend the maturity to July 6, 2028. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate was approximately 8.20%. An annual unused facility fee is charged based on the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during the trailing twelve month period ending each June 30. The fee will be calculated at 0.25% per annum if the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during such trailing twelve month period was greater than fifty percent, and will be calculated at 0.15% if the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during such trailing twelve month period was less than or equal to fifty percent. The obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into a second amended and restated guaranty of payment as of July 6, 2024 (“Second Amended Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents.\n\nThe Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement requires the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and the Company to comply with certain covenants, including, among others, customary financial covenants. The Lender may accelerate amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Agreement) including, but not limited to, the failure to pay amounts due the Lender or commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nOn July 8, 2024, in connection with the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a swap transaction for an interest rate derivative with Huntington (the \"Cap Rate Agreement\") effective July 10, 2024. The notional amount and strike is $7,500,000 and 5.25%, respectively. The cost of the initial premium was $57,000 and will be carried as an asset on the balance sheet at fair value. The Cap Rate Agreement terminates on July 6, 2027.\n\nThe Company incurred issuance costs of $235,164 and $231,926 for the July 6, 2024 Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement and the prior Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement in July 6, 2021, respectively, and such costs are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the term of the loan. The Company recorded amortization expense of $19,597 and $25,400 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively $70,398 and $76,201 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There was no outstanding loan balance under the Revolving Line of Credit as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n\n8. LEASES\n\nGlobal Self Storage as Lessor\n\nThe Company's property rental revenue is primarily related to rents received from tenants at its operating stores. The Company's leases with its self storage tenants are generally on month-to-month terms, include automatic monthly renewals, allow flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit, and provide for the collection of contingent fees such as late fees. These leases do not include any terms or conditions that allow the tenants to purchase the leased space. All self-storage leases for which the Company acts as lessor have been classified as operating leases. The real estate assets related to the Company's stores are included in \"Real estate assets, net\" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and are presented at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Rental income related to these operating leases is included in property rental revenue on the Company's consolidated statements of operations, and is recognized each month during the month-to-month terms at the rental rate in place during each month.\n\nGlobal Self Storage as Lessee\n\n16\n\nThe Company is a lessee in a lease agreement for an automobile entered into November 2022 with a lease term of three years. The lease agreement does not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company’s lease agreement has been classified as an operating lease. Lease expense for payments related to the Company’s operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nRight-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments as specified in the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to the Company’s operating leases are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available surrounding the Company’s secured borrowing rates and implied secured spread at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The right-of-use asset also includes any lease payments made at or before lease commencement less any lease incentives. The Company had right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to its operating leases of $21,408 and $21,408, respectively, as of September 30, 2024 and $35,726 and $35,726, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. Such amounts are amortized using a straight-line method over the term of the lease, and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Amortization expense was $4,818 and $4,640 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $14,318 and $13,740 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate related to its operating leases were approximately 1.1 years and 3.77%, respectively.\n\nThe remaining future minimum lease payments under the automobile lease are $21,882 as of September 30, 2024 and the future minimum lease payments are $5,049 and $16,833 for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\n9. EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nEarnings per share is calculated under the two-class method under which all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. The Company grants restricted stock to certain employees under its stock-based compensation programs, which entitle recipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to holders of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value per share; these unvested awards meet the definition of participating securities.\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\n\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet income | $ | 1,181,657 | $ | 270,758 | $ | 2,039,337 | $ | 1,841,369  \nEarnings and dividends allocated to participating securities | (11,290 | ) | (6,406 | ) | (29,343 | ) | (18,667 | )  \nNet income attributable to common stockholders | $ | 1,170,367 | $ | 264,352 | $ | 2,009,994 | $ | 1,822,702  \nWeighted average common shares outstanding:  \nAverage number of common shares outstanding - basic | 11,101,705 | 11,048,877 | 11,087,613 | 11,041,578  \nNet effect of dilutive unvested restricted stock awards included for treasury stock method | 57,482 | 41,797 | 39,403 | 43,106  \nAverage number of common shares outstanding - diluted | 11,159,187 | 11,090,674 | 11,127,016 | 11,084,684  \nEarnings per common share  \nBasic | $ | 0.11 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.17  \nDiluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.16  \n  \nCommon stock dividends totaled $816,875 ($0.0725 per share) and $808,876 ($0.0725 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2,442,284 ($0.2175 per share) and $2,422,037 ($0.2175 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n17\n\n10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nCertain officers and directors of the Company also serve as officers and/or directors of Winmill & Co. Incorporated (“Winco”), Bexil Corporation, Tuxis Corporation, and/or their affiliates (collectively with the Company, the “Affiliates”). As of September 30, 2024, certain of the Affiliates and the Company’s directors and employees may be deemed to own, in the aggregate, approximately 9.6% of the outstanding common stock.\n\nPursuant to an arrangement between a professional employer organization (“PEO”) and the Affiliates, the PEO provides payroll, benefits, compliance, and related services for employees of the Affiliates in accordance with applicable rules and regulations under the Code and, in connection therewith, Midas Management Corporation (“MMC”), a subsidiary of Winco, acts as a conduit payer of compensation and benefits to the Affiliates’ employees including those who are concurrently employed by the Company and its Affiliates. The aggregate compensation and benefits accrued and funded by the Company to MMC were $744,527 and $720,343 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $2,295,429 and $2,136,395 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Expenses for various concurrently used administrative and support functions incurred by the Affiliates are allocated at cost among them. The aggregate administrative and support function expenses accrued and paid by the Company to Winco was $9,686 and $7,272 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $24,750 and $21,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Affiliates participate in a 401(k) retirement savings plan for substantially all qualified employees. A matching expense based upon a percentage of contributions to the plan by eligible employees is incurred and allocated among the Affiliates. The matching expense is accrued and funded on a current basis and may not exceed the amount permitted as a deductible expense under the Code. The Company's allocated matching expense was $25,018 and $22,857 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $82,315 and $76,671 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had reimbursements payable to MMC and Winco for compensation, benefits, and administrative and support function expenses of $22,825 and $23,523 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company currently reimburses monthly automobile expenses of $1,000 per month to its President, Mark C. Winmill. To the extent that the monthly payment under the Company’s automobile lease exceeds the current monthly reimbursement amount, Mr. Winmill voluntarily reimburses the Company for the excess amount. In this regard, Mr. Winmill has reimbursed the Company $8,198 and $8,198 for the automobile payments paid and due in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nThe Company leases office space and storage to certain Affiliates under rental agreements. The terms of occupancy are month to month and automatically renew unless terminated by either party on thirty days’ written notice. The Company earned rental income of $1,200 and $1,200 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $3,600 and $3,600 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n11. CAPITAL STOCK\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company was authorized to issue 450,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share of which 11,267,253 were issued and outstanding. The Company was also authorized to issue 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which none has been issued.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through the Agent. There were no shares of common stock sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, under the Sales Agreement.\n\n12. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nOn October 16, 2017 (“Effective Date”), the Company’s stockholders approved the Company’s 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is designed to provide equity-based incentives to certain eligible persons, as defined in the Plan, in the form of options, share appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalent rights or other forms of equity-based compensation as determined in the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, or other designee thereof. The total number of shares of common stock reserved and available for issuance under the Plan on the Effective Date was 760,000.\n\nThe Company recorded $74,207 and $44,720 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $218,136 and $126,428 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of expense related to restricted stock awards in general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was $400,266 and $232,262 of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested time-based and performance-based restricted stock awards,\n\n18\n\nrespectively. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 years and 2.6 years for time-based and performance-based awards, respectively. The fair value of common stock awards is determined based on the closing trading price of the common stock on the grant date. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur, compensation cost previously recognized for an award that is forfeited because of a failure to satisfy a service or performance condition is reversed in the period of the forfeiture.\n\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Grants\n\nThese time-based grants vest solely based on continued employment, with 6.25% of the shares eligible to vest on each three- month anniversary of the grant date during the remaining four-year time vesting period. Time-based restricted stock cannot be transferred during the vesting period. These time-based restricted stock grants entitle the holder to dividends paid by the Company on shares of its common stock, including unvested shares.\n\nA summary of the Company’s time-based restricted stock grant activity is as follows:\n\nWeighted-Average  \n---  \nGrant-Date  \nTime-Based Restricted Stock Grants | Shares | Fair Value  \nUnvested at December 31, 2023 | 33,100 | $ | 4.84  \nGranted | 91,544 | $ | 4.33  \nVested | (31,828 | ) | $ | 4.51  \nForfeited | (1,530 | ) | $ | 5.22  \nUnvested at September 30, 2024 | 91,286 | $ | 4.43  \n  \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Grants\n\nPerformance-based restricted stock grants vest based on continued employment and the achievement of certain Funds from Operations, as adjusted (“AFFO”) and same store revenue growth (“SSRG”) goals by the Company during the year of the grant. Each of these performance components are weighted 50% and are measured over the performance cycle, which is defined as the year ending on December 31st in the year of the grant. At the end of the performance cycle, the financial performance components are reviewed to determine the number of shares actually earned, which can be as low as 0% of shares granted and up to a maximum of 200% of shares granted. The shares which are earned will remain subject to quarterly vesting during the remaining four-year time vesting period. Dividends paid by the Company prior to the determination of how many shares are earned will be retained by the Company and released only with respect to earned shares. If a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan) occurs the number of shares earned will equal the greater of the number of shares granted and the number of shares which would have been earned based on the AFFO and SSRG through the date of the Change in Control. If following a Change in Control, a grantee is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the grantee with Good Reason (as each is defined in the Plan), all unvested restricted stock will fully vest.\n\nA summary of the Company’s performance-based restricted stock grant activity is as follows:\n\nWeighted-Average  \n---  \nGrant-Date  \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Grants | Shares | Fair Value  \nUnvested at December 31, 2023 | 40,024 | $ | 5.14  \nGranted | 23,726 | $ | 4.32  \nVested | (12,161 | ) | $ | 5.08  \nUnvested at September 30, 2024 | 51,589 | $ | 4.78  \n  \n13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nThe Company enters into contracts that contain a variety of representations and warranties and which may provide general indemnifications. The Company’s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as it involves future claims that may be made against the Company under circumstances that have not occurred.\n\n14. RISKS AND UNCERTANTIES\n\n19\n\nGeneral Market Risks\n\nThe Company’s operating activities are affected by global and national economic, political and market conditions generally and also by the local economic conditions where its assets are located. U.S. and international markets have experienced volatility in recent months and years due to a number of economic, political and global macro factors, including rising inflation, wars between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and the impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic. Uncertainties regarding the level and direction of central banks’ interest rate changes, political events, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict, trade tensions and the possibility of a national or global recession have also contributed to market volatility. The full impact of such external events on the financial and credit markets and consequently on the Company’s financial conditions and results of operations is uncertain and cannot be fully predicted. The Company will continue to monitor these events and will adjust its operations as necessary.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nCredit risk - Financial assets that are exposed to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and certain portions of accounts receivable including rents receivable from our tenants. Risk to collection of rents receivable is mitigated by: (i) dispersion of rents receivable across many tenants, (ii) marketing targeted to tenants that have established credit, (iii) use of autopay, and (iv) use of collection procedures. Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are on deposit with highly rated commercial banks and financial institutions.\n\nMarket Risk\n\nInvestments in securities subject the Company to market risk. Investments in securities may decline in value. The Company monitors the stock prices of the investments and the financial performance of the related companies.\n\n20\n\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n\nCAUTIONARY LANGUAGE\n\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited “Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” and the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)” appearing elsewhere in this report. We make statements in this section that may be forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward looking statements, see the section in this report entitled “Statement on Forward Looking Information.” References to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our company” refer to Global Self Storage, Inc., a Maryland corporation, including, as the context requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report describe the significant accounting policies essential to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Preparation of our financial statements requires estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions that we have used are appropriate and correct based on information available at the time they were made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect our reported assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the period presented. If there are material differences between these estimates, judgments, and assumptions and actual facts, our financial statements may be affected.\n\nIn many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require our judgment in its application. There are areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result, but there are some areas in which our judgment in selecting among available alternatives would produce a materially different result. Please refer to the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements that contain additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and other disclosures.\n\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis Overview\n\nThe Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT that owns, operates, manages, acquires, and redevelops self storage properties (“stores” or “properties”) in the United States. Our stores are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible, and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. As of September 30, 2024, the Company owned and operated, or managed, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, thirteen stores located in Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Oklahoma. The Company was formerly registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) as a non-diversified, closed end management investment company. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) order approving the Company’s application to deregister from the 1940 Act was granted on January 19, 2016. On January 19, 2016, the Company changed its name to Global Self Storage, Inc. from Self Storage Group, Inc., changed its SEC registration from an investment company to an operating company reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and listed its common stock on NASDAQ under the symbol “SELF”.\n\nThe Company was incorporated on December 12, 1996 under the laws of the state of Maryland. The Company has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). To the extent the Company continues to qualify as a REIT, it will not generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax, with certain limited exceptions, on its taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders.\n\nOur store operations generated most of our net income for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, a significant portion of management’s time is devoted to seeking to maximize cash flows from our existing stores, as well as seeking investments in additional stores. The Company expects to continue to earn a majority of its gross income from its store operations as its current store operations continue to develop and as it makes additional store acquisitions. Over time, the Company expects to divest its remaining portfolio of investment securities and use the proceeds to acquire and operate additional stores. The Company expects its income from investment securities to continue to decrease as it continues to divest its holdings of investment securities.\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nOur financing strategy is to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our stockholders. For future acquisitions, the Company may employ various financing and capital raising alternatives including, but not limited to, debt and/or equity offerings, credit facilities, mortgage financing, and joint ventures with third parties.\n\n21\n\nOn June 24, 2016, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company (“Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries”) entered into a loan agreement and certain other related agreements (collectively, the “Term Loan Agreement”) between the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries and Insurance Strategy Funding IV, LLC (the “Term Loan Lender”). Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries borrowed from Term Loan Lender in the principal amount of $20 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Term Loan Promissory Note”). The Term Loan Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 4.192% per annum and is due to mature on July 1, 2036. Pursuant to a security agreement (the “Term Loan Security Agreement”), the obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries. J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. acted as Special Purpose Vehicle Agent of the Term Loan Lender. The Company entered into a non-recourse guaranty (the “Term Loan Guaranty,” and together with the Term Loan Agreement, the Term Loan Promissory Note and the Term Loan Security Agreement, the “Term Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Term Loan Lender of certain obligations of the Term Loan Secured Subsidiaries under the Term Loan Agreement. We have used some of the proceeds from the Term Loan Agreement to acquire four self storage properties in 2016.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries (“Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) entered into a revolving credit loan agreement (collectively, the “Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and TCF National Bank (“Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $10 million pursuant to a promissory note (the “Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3.00% over the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate and was due to mature on December 20, 2021. The obligations under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. We entered into a guaranty of payment on December 20, 2018 (the “Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Credit Facility Loan Agreement. As described in more detail below, the Credit Facility Loan Agreement has been replaced in its entirety by the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement on July 6, 2021.\n\nOn December 18, 2019, we completed a rights offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,601,291 shares of our common stock (“common stock”) at the subscription price of $4.18 per whole share of common stock, pursuant to the exercise of subscriptions and oversubscriptions from our stockholders. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.7 million in the rights offering.\n\nOn May 19, 2020, an affiliate of the Company (the “Borrower”) entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Term Note (“PPP Note”) with Customers Bank on behalf of itself, the Company, and certain other affiliates under the Paycheck Protection Program of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”). The Borrower received total proceeds of $486,602 from the PPP Note. On April 5, 2022, the Borrower was granted forgiveness of the entire PPP Note and any accrued interest. Upon forgiveness, the Company received $307,210 in cash from the Borrower, which was the amount attributable to the Company under the SBA's loan determination formula, and recorded a gain for such amount in its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.\n\nOn June 25, 2021, we completed an underwritten public offering whereby we sold and issued an aggregate of 1,121,496 shares of our common stock at the price of $5.35 per share. Subsequently, the over-allotment option was exercised, increasing the total number of shares sold and issued to 1,289,720. We raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.9 million in the public offering after giving effect to the exercise of the over-allotment option.\n\nOn July 6, 2021, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) of the Company entered into a first amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National Bank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (“Amended Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries were able to borrow from the Amended Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million, reduced to $14.75 million and $14.5 million in years 2 and 3, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the “Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note bore an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month U.S. Dollar London Inter-Bank Offered Rate or 0.25% and was due to mature on July 6, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the effective interest rate was 8.44%. The publication of LIBOR ceased after June 30, 2023. The Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement provided for a replacement index based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). The interest rate on the Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note subsequent to June 30, 2023, was equal to 3% plus the greater of SOFR plus 0.11448% or 0.25%. The obligations under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement were secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into an amended and restated guaranty of payment on July 6, 2021 (“Amended Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Amended Credit Facility Lender\n\n22\n\nof certain obligations of the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents. As described in more detail below, the Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement has been replaced in its entirety by the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement on July 6, 2024.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, the Company entered into an At Market Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (the “Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may sell, from time to time, shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $15,000,000, through the Agent. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, under the Sales Agreement, the Company sold and issued an aggregate of 373,833 shares of common stock and raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2,272,628, less sales commissions of approximately $45,491 and other offering costs resulting in net proceeds of $2,008,436. There were no shares of common stock sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 under the Sales Agreement.\n\nOn July 6, 2024, certain wholly owned subsidiaries (“Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries”) of the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Facility Loan Agreement (collectively, the “Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement”) between the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries and The Huntington National Bank, successor by merger to TCF National Bank (“Second Amended Credit Facility Lender”). Under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries may borrow from the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender in the principal amount of up to $15 million, reduced to $14.75 million and $14.5 million in years 2 and 3, respectively, pursuant to a promissory note (the “Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note”). The Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note bears an interest rate equal to 3% plus the greater of the One Month SOFR or 0.25% and is due to mature on July 6, 2027, with an option to extend the maturity to July 6, 2028. An annual unused facility fee is charged based on the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during the trailing twelve month period ending each June 30. The fee will be calculated at 0.25% per annum if the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during such trailing twelve month period was greater than fifty percent, and will be calculated at 0.15% if the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement during such trailing twelve month period was less than or equal to fifty percent. The obligations under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement are secured by certain real estate assets owned by the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries. The Company entered into a second amended and restated guaranty of payment as of July 6, 2024 (“Second Amended Credit Facility Guaranty,” and together with the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Second Amended Credit Facility Promissory Note and related instruments, the “Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents”) to guarantee the payment to the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender of certain obligations of the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. The Company and the Second Amended Credit Facility Secured Subsidiaries paid customary fees and expenses in connection with their entry into the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Documents. The Company also maintains a bank account at the Second Amended Credit Facility Lender. As of September 30, 2024, we have no withdrawn proceeds under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement. We currently intend to strategically withdraw proceeds available under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement to fund: (i) the acquisition of additional self storage properties, (ii) expansions at existing self storage properties in our portfolio, and/or (iii) joint ventures with third parties for the acquisition and expansion of self storage properties.\n\nOn July 8, 2024, in connection with the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement, the Company entered into a swap transaction for an interest rate derivative with Huntington (the \"Cap Rate Agreement\") effective July 10, 2024. The notional amount and strike is $7,500,000 and 5.25%, respectively. The cost of the initial premium was $57,000 and will be carried as an asset on the balance sheet at fair value. The Cap Rate Agreement terminates on July 6, 2027.\n\nWe continue to actively review a number of store and store portfolio acquisition opportunities and have been working to further develop and expand our current stores. We did not complete any acquisitions in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. In addition, we may pursue third-party management opportunities of properties owned by certain affiliates or joint venture partners for a fee, and utilize such relationships with third-party owners as a source for future acquisitions and investment opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, under our third-party management platform, Global MaxManagementSM, we managed one third-party owned property, which was previously rebranded as “Global Self Storage,” had 137,318-leasable square feet and was comprised of 619 climate-controlled and non-climate-controlled units located in Edmond, Oklahoma.\n\nWe expect we will have sufficient cash from current sources to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months because our capital resources currently exceed our projected expenses for the next twelve months. However, we may opt to supplement our equity capital and increase potential returns to our stockholders through the use of prudent levels of borrowings. We may use debt when the available terms and conditions are favorable to long-term investing and well-aligned with our strategic business plan.\n\nThe Company currently has capital resources totaling approximately $25.1 million, comprised of $6.9 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and $3.2 million of marketable securities as of September 30, 2024, and $15 million available for\n\n23\n\nwithdrawal under the Second Amended Credit Facility Loan Agreement which matures on July 6, 2027. Capital resources derived from retained cash flow have been and are currently expected to continue to be negligible. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less stockholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain stores. These capital resources allow us to continue to execute our strategic business plan, which includes funding acquisitions, either directly or through joint ventures; expansion projects at our existing properties; and broadening our revenue base and pipeline of potential acquisitions through developing Global MaxManagementSM, our third-party management platform. Our board of directors regularly reviews our strategic business plan, including topics and metrices like capital formation, debt versus equity ratios, dividend policy, use of capital and debt, funds from operations (“FFO”) and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) performance, and optimal cash levels. See the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for the definition and use of FFO and AFFO.\n\nWe expect that the results of our operations will be affected by a number of factors. Many of the factors that will affect our operating results are beyond our control. The Company and its properties could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to, among other things, public health crises, natural disasters and geopolitical events, including the ongoing conflict between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, financial and credit market volatility and disruptions, inflationary pressures, rising interest rate fluctuations, supply chain issues, labor shortages and recessionary concerns.\n\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\n\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenues increased from $3,090,374 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $3,200,276 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.6%, or $109,902. Rental income increased from $2,968,263 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $3,070,871 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 3.5%, or $102,608. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in occupancy and existing tenant rates under our proprietary revenue rate management program, which was partially offset by lower move-in rental rates year-over-year across the United States and in the markets that we operate.\n\nOther property related income consists of tenant insurance fees, sales of storage supplies, and other ancillary revenues. Other property related income increased from $103,676 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $111,618 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.7%, or $7,942. The increase was primarily attributable to additional tenants subscribing to tenant insurance.\n\nIncome from our third-party management platform consists of management fees and customer insurance fees. Management fees and other income decreased from $18,435 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $17,787 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the adjustment of fees for our third-party management services in accordance with current market rates.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses increased from $2,261,841 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $2,327,186 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.9%, or $65,345, which was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses. Store operating expenses decreased from $1,163,064 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $1,153,947 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.8%, or $9,117.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $683,629 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $762,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 11.5%, or $78,371. The increase in general and administrative expenses during this period are primarily attributable to increased professional fees and employment costs.\n\nDepreciation and amortization decreased from $409,245 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $409,227 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nBusiness development which includes capital raising, store acquisition, and third-party management marketing expenses decreased from $5,903 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $2,012 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 65.9%, or $3,891. These costs primarily consist of costs incurred in connection with business development, capital raising, and future potential store acquisitions, and third-party management marketing expenses. Business development costs are typically non-recurring and fluctuate based on periodic business development and acquisition activity.\n\n24\n\nOperating Income\n\nAs a result of the operating effects noted above, operating income increased from $828,533 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $873,090 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.4%, or $44,557.\n\nOther income (expense)\n\nInterest expense on debt increased from $212,712 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $259,419 during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap and the decrease in cash settlements under the interest rate cap. The cash payments for the $20 million Term Loan Agreement remain the same every month until June 2036 and are $107,699 per month.\n\nDividend, interest, and other income was $66,906 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $68,703 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nUnrealized loss on marketable equity securities was $411,969 during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and the unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was $499,283 during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet income\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, net income was $270,758, or $0.02 per fully diluted share. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $1,181,657, or $0.10 per fully diluted share.\n\nResults of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\n\nRevenues\n\nTotal revenues increased from $9,214,345 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $9,343,354 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4%, or $129,009. Rental income increased from $8,857,845 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $8,967,371 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 1.2%, or $109,526. The increase was primarily attributable to increased occupancies and increases in existing tenant rates under our revenue rate management program.\n\nOther property related income consists of customer insurance fees, sales of storage supplies, and other ancillary revenues. Other property related income increased from $293,788 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $323,957 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 10.3%, or $30,169. The increase was primarily attributable to additional tenants subscribing to tenant insurance.\n\nIncome from our third-party management platform consists of management fees and customer insurance fees. Management fees and other income decreased from $62,712 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $52,026 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the adjustment of fees for our third-party management services in accordance with current market rates.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nTotal operating expenses increased from $6,783,120 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $7,243,360 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.8%, or $460,240, which was primarily attributable to an increase in store level expenses and general and administrative expenses. Store operating expenses increased from $3,374,379 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $3,556,232 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.4%, or $181,853. The increase in store operating expenses was due primarily to increased expenses for employment costs and property insurance.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased from $2,172,965 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $2,457,551 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 13.1%, or $284,586. The increase in general and administrative expenses during this period are primarily attributable to increased professional fees and employment costs.\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased from $1,224,624 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $1,225,290 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1%, or $666.\n\nBusiness development, capital raising, store acquisition, and third-party management marketing expenses decreased from $11,152 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $4,287 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These costs primarily\n\n25\n\nconsist of costs incurred in connection with business development, capital raising, and future potential store acquisitions, and third-party management marketing expenses. Business development costs are typically non-recurring and fluctuate based on periodic business development and acquisition activity.\n\nOperating Income\n\nAs a result of the operating effects noted above, operating income decreased from $2,431,225 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $2,099,994 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 13.6%, or $331,231.\n\nOther income (expense)\n\nInterest expense on debt increased from $619,550 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $675,622 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was attributable to the change in fair value of the interest rate cap partially offset by cash settlements under the interest rate cap from the difference between the reference interest rate and the strike rate and lower interest payments under the Term Loan Agreement. The cash payments for the $20 million Term Loan Agreement remain the same every month until June 2036 and are $107,699 per month.\n\nDividend, interest, and other income was $194,960 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and $211,030 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was attributable to the dividends earned on money market mutual fund balances.\n\nUnrealized loss on marketable equity securities was $165,266 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was $403,935 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet income\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net income was $1,841,369, or $0.16 per fully diluted share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $2,039,337, or $0.18 per fully diluted share.\n\nDistributions and Closing Market Prices\n\nDistributions for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $0.0725 per share. The Company’s closing market price as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $5.21 and $4.86, respectively. Past market price performance and distribution levels do not guarantee similar results in the future.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. NAREIT defines FFO as a REIT’s net income, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, and adding back real estate depreciation and amortization. The Company also excludes changes in unrealized gains or losses on marketable equity securities. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, FFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company’s financial statements.\n\nAdjusted FFO (“AFFO”) and AFFO per share are non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, business development, capital raising, and acquisition related costs and non-recurring items, which we believe are not indicative of the Company’s operating results. AFFO and AFFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. AFFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. We present AFFO because we believe it is a helpful measure in understanding our results of operations insofar as we believe that the items noted above that are included in FFO, but excluded from AFFO, are not indicative of our ongoing operating results. We also believe that the analyst community considers our AFFO (or similar measures using different terminology) when evaluating us. Because other REITs or real estate companies may not compute AFFO in the same manner as we do, and may use different terminology, our computation of AFFO may not be comparable to AFFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies. However, the Company believes that to further understand the performance of its stores, AFFO should be considered along with the net income and cash flows reported in accordance with GAAP and as presented in the Company’s financial statements.\n\n26\n\nWe believe net operating income or “NOI” is a meaningful measure of operating performance because we utilize NOI in making decisions with respect to, among other things, capital allocations, determining current store values, evaluating store performance, and in comparing period-to-period and market-to-market store operating results. In addition, we believe the investment community utilizes NOI in determining operating performance and real estate values and does not consider depreciation expense because it is based upon historical cost. NOI is defined as net store earnings before general and administrative expenses, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nNOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results.\n\nSelf Storage Portfolio\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our same-store self storage operations are presented on a comparative basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nGLOBAL SELF STORAGE STORES\n\nYear Store | Number | Net Leasable | September 30, 2024 Square Foot | September 30, 2023 Square Foot  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nProperty(1) | Address | Opened / Acquired | of Units | Square Feet | Occupancy % | Occupancy %  \nOWNED STORES  \nSSG BOLINGBROOK LLC | 296 North Weber Road, Bolingbrook, IL 60440 | 1997 / 2013 | 809 | 114,000 | 90.4 | % | 92.2 | %  \nSSG CLINTON LLC | 6 Heritage Park Road, Clinton, CT 06413 | 1996 / 2016 | 182 | 30,408 | 87.7 | % | 90.8 | %  \nSSG DOLTON LLC | 14900 Woodlawn Avenue, Dolton, IL 60419 | 2007 / 2013 | 652 | 86,590 | 90.5 | % | 86.0 | %  \nSSG FISHERS LLC | 13942 East 96th Street, McCordsville, IN 46055 | 2007 / 2016 | 546 | 76,385 | 93.8 | % | 88.8 | %  \nSSG LIMA LLC | 1910 West Robb Avenue, Lima, OH 60419 | 1996 / 2016 | 768 | 94,953 | 89.7 | % | 90.0 | %  \nSSG MERRILLVILLE LLC | 6590 Broadway, Merrillville, IN 46410 | 2005 / 2013 | 570 | 81,270 | 91.6 | % | 91.9 | %  \nSSG MILLBROOK LLC | 3814 Route 44, Millbrook, NY 12545 | 2008 / 2016 | 260 | 24,482 | 90.9 | % | 92.2 | %  \nSSG ROCHESTER LLC | 2255 Buffalo Road, Rochester, NY 14624 | 2010 / 2012 | 649 | 68,311 | 94.9 | % | 94.0 | %  \nSSG SADSBURY LLC | 21 Aim Boulevard, Sadsburyville, PA 19369 | 2006 / 2012 | 694 | 78,875 | 93.1 | % | 89.0 | %  \nSSG SUMMERVILLE I LLC | 1713 Old Trolley Road, Summerville, SC 29485 | 1990 / 2013 | 569 | 76,460 | 91.9 | % | 91.3 | %  \nSSG SUMMERVILLE II LLC | 900 North Gum Street, Summerville, SC 29483 | 1997 / 2013 | 250 | 43,710 | 94.2 | % | 86.1 | %  \nSSG WEST HENRIETTA LLC | 70 Erie Station Road, West Henrietta, NY 14586 | 2016 / 2019 | 483 | 55,550 | 88.8 | % | 84.0 | %  \nTOTAL/AVERAGESAME-STORES | 6,432 | 830,994 | 91.5 | % | 89.8 | %  \nMANAGED STORES  \nTPM EDMOND LLC | 14000 N I 35 Service Rd, Edmond, OK 73013 | 2015 / 2019 | 619 | 137,318 | 96.0 | % | 94.7 | %  \nTOTAL/AVERAGE MANAGED STORES | 619 | 137,318 | 96.0 | % | 94.7 | %  \nTOTAL/AVERAGE ALL OWNED/MANAGED STORES | 7,051 | 968,312 | 92.2 | % | 90.5 | %  \n  \n(1)\n\nEach store is directly owned or managed by the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary listed in the table.\n\nCertain stores’ leasable square feet in the chart above includes outside auto/RV/boat storage space: approximately 12,800 square feet at SSG Sadsbury LLC; 6,300 square feet at SSG Fishers LLC; 16,000 square feet at SSG Bolingbrook LLC; 8,900 square feet at\n\n27\n\nSSG Dolton LLC; 2,100 square feet at SSG Merrillville LLC; 3,800 square feet at SSG Summerville I LLC; 8,000 square feet at SSG Summerville II LLC and 8,800 square feet at SSG Clinton LLC. For SSG Lima LLC, included is approximately 3,800 square feet of non-storage commercial and student housing space. For SSG Millbrook LLC, included is approximately 1,300 square feet of wine storage and non-storage office space. For SSG Fishers LLC, included is approximately 300 square feet of storage locker space. Approximately 33% of our total available units are climate-controlled, 59% are traditional drive-up storage, and 8% are outdoor parking storage for boats, cars and recreational vehicles.\n\nSame-Store Self Storage Operations\n\nWe consider our same-store portfolio to consist of only those stores owned and operated on a stabilized basis at the beginning and at the end of the applicable periods presented. We consider a store to be stabilized once it has achieved an occupancy rate that we believe, based on our assessment of market-specific data, is representative of similar self storage assets in the applicable market for a full year measured as of the most recent January 1 and has not been significantly damaged by natural disaster or undergone significant renovation or expansion. We believe that same-store results are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because they provide information relating to changes in store-level operating performance without taking into account the effects of acquisitions, dispositions, or new ground-up developments. At September 30, 2024, we owned twelve same-store properties and zero non same-store properties. The Company believes that by providing same-store results from a stabilized pool of stores, with accompanying operating metrics including, but not limited to, variances in occupancy, rental revenue, operating expenses, and NOI, stockholders and potential investors are able to evaluate operating performance without the effects of non-stabilized occupancy levels, rent levels, expense levels, acquisitions, or completed developments. Same-store results should not be used as a basis for future same-store performance or for the performance of the Company’s stores as a whole.\n\nSame-store occupancy at September 30, 2024 increased by 1.7% to 91.5% from 89.8% at September 30, 2023.\n\nSame-store revenues increased by 3.6% and 1.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023. Same-store cost of operations decreased by 0.8% and increased 5.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023. Same-store NOI increased by 6.3% and decreased 0.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023. The increase in same-store NOI during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to an increase in revenues and decrease in cost of operations.\n\nWe believe that our results were driven by, among other things, our internet and digital marketing initiatives which helped maintain our overall average same-store occupancy of approximately 92% as of September 30, 2024. Also, contributing to our results were our customer service efforts which we believe were essential in building local brand loyalty, resulting in strong referral and word-of-mouth market demand for our storage units and services. Another contributing factor to our results was our competitor move-in rate metrics analysis which employs internet data scraping and other methods to help keep our storage unit move-in rates “in the market,” and our revenue rate management program which helped increase existing tenant rates while optimizing store occupancy.\n\nThese results are summarized as follows:\n\nSAME - STORE PROPERTIES  \n---  \nThree Months Ended September 30, | 2024 | 2023 | Variance | % Change  \nRevenues | $ | 3,182,489 | $ | 3,071,939 | $ | 110,550 | 3.6 | %  \nCost of operations | $ | 1,153,947 | $ | 1,163,064 | $ | (9,117 | ) | -0.8 | %  \nNet operating income | $ | 2,028,542 | $ | 1,908,875 | $ | 119,667 | 6.3 | %  \nDepreciation and amortization | $ | 363,123 | $ | 363,088 | $ | 35 | 0.0 | %  \nNet leasable square footage at period end* | 830,994 | 830,018 | 976 | 0.1 | %  \nNet leased square footage at period end | 760,641 | 745,335 | 15,306 | 2.1 | %  \nOverall square foot occupancy at period end | 91.5 | % | 89.8 | % | 1.7 | % | 1.9 | %  \nTotal annualized revenue per leased square foot | $ | 16.74 | $ | 16.49 | $ | 0.25 | 1.5 | %  \nTotal available leasable storage units* | 6,432 | 6,421 | 11 | 0.2 | %  \nNumber of leased storage units | 5,773 | 5,641 | 132 | 2.3 | %  \n  \n28\n\nSAME - STORE PROPERTIES  \n---  \nNine Months Ended September 30, | 2024 | 2023 | Variance | % Change  \nRevenues | $ | 9,291,328 | $ | 9,151,633 | $ | 139,695 | 1.5 | %  \nCost of operations | $ | 3,556,232 | $ | 3,374,379 | $ | 181,853 | 5.4 | %  \nNet operating income | $ | 5,735,096 | $ | 5,777,254 | $ | (42,158 | ) | -0.7 | %  \nDepreciation and amortization | $ | 1,086,925 | $ | 1,086,308 | $ | 617 | 0.1 | %  \nNet leasable square footage at period end* | $ | 830,994 | 830,018 | 976 | 0.1 | %  \nNet leased square footage at period end | 760,641 | 745,335 | 15,306 | 2.1 | %  \nOverall square foot occupancy at period end | 91.5 | % | 89.8 | % | 1.7 | % | 1.9 | %  \nTotal annualized revenue per leased square foot | $ | 16.29 | $ | 16.37 | $ | (0.08 | ) | -0.5 | %  \nTotal available leasable storage units* | 6,432 | 6,421 | 11 | 0.2 | %  \nNumber of leased storage units | 5,773 | 5,641 | 132 | 2.3 | %  \n  \n* From time to time, as guided by market conditions, net leasable square footage and total available leasable storage units at our properties may increase or decrease as a result of consolidation, division or reconfiguration of storage units.

Same-store average overall square foot occupancy for all of the Company’s same-store properties increased to 91.5% at September 30, 2024, up from 89.8% at September 30, 2023.\n\nWe believe that our focus on maintaining high occupancy helps us to maximize rental income at our properties. We seek to maintain an average square foot occupancy level at or above 90% by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our online marketing efforts in seeking to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate. Demand may fluctuate due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand is generally higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, we observed no material degradation in rent collections. However, we believe that our bad debt losses could increase from historical levels, due to (i) cumulative stress (such as inflation, recession fears, etc.) on our customers’ financial capacity and (ii) reduced rent recoveries from auctioned units.\n\n29\n\nWe may experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty. This could lead to lower occupancies and rent “roll down” as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates.\n\nWe currently expect rental income growth, if any, to come from a combination of the following: (i) continued existing tenant rent increases, (ii) higher rental rates charged to new tenants, (iii) lower promotional discounts, and (iv) higher occupancies. Our future rental income growth will likely also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including, among other things, demand for self storage space, the level of competitor supply of self storage space, and the average length of stay of our tenants. Increasing existing tenant rental rates, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We typically determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. We currently expect existing tenant rent increases for the remainder of 2024, if any, to be similar to those in the prior year.\n\nIt is difficult to predict trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents, and occupancy levels. Current trends, when viewed in the short-term, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they may be subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include, among others, initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants.\n\nImportantly, we continue to refine our ongoing revenue rate management program which includes regular internet data scraping of local competitors’ prices. We do this in seeking to maintain our competitive market price advantage for our various sized storage units at our stores. This program helps us in seeking to maximize each store’s occupancies and our self storage revenue and NOI. We believe that, through our various marketing initiatives, we can continue to attract high quality, long term tenants who we expect will be storing with us for years. As of September 30, 2024, our average tenant duration of stay was approximately 3.4 years, which was up from 3.3 years as of September 30, 2023.\n\nAnalysis of Same-Store Cost of Operations\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, same-store cost of operations decreased 0.8%, or $9,117, and increased 5.4%, or $181,853, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. This decrease in same-store cost of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to decreased expenses for real estate property taxes.\n\nEmployment. On-site store manager, regional manager, and district manager payroll expense increased 3.8%, or $12,601, and 9.1%, or $89,437, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. The increase was due primarily to routine employee hiring and inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees. We currently expect inflationary increases in compensation rates for existing employees and other increases in compensation costs as we potentially add new stores.\n\nReal Estate Property Tax. Store property tax expense decreased 6.4%, or $27,165, and increased 0.4%, or $4,693, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. When compared to store property tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, we currently expect store property tax expense to be consistent during the rest of 2024. See the section titled “Property Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL” for additional detail regarding property tax relief obtained for our Dolton, IL property in 2024, which will partially offset our increased real estate property taxes.\n\nAdministrative. We classify administrative expenses as bank charges related to processing the stores’ cash receipts, credit card fees, repairs and maintenance, utilities, landscaping, alarm monitoring and trash removal. Administrative expenses decreased 2.2%, or $4,727, and increased 1.5%, or $9,439, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. We experienced a decrease in administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due primarily to decreased repairs and maintenance expenses. We currently expect moderate increases in other direct store costs in 2024.\n\nRepairs and Maintenance. Repairs and maintenance expense decreased 19.8%, or $10,883, and 8.2%, or $11,998, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. These expenses decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 primarily due to one-off repairs and maintenance completed in the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nUtilities.  Our utility expenses are currently comprised of electricity, oil, and gas costs, which vary by store and are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Also, affecting our utilities expenses over time is our ongoing LED light replacement program at all of our stores which has already resulted in lower electricity usage. Utilities expense decreased 2.2%, or $1,370, and 4.8%, or $10,032, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. It is difficult to estimate future utility costs because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and unpredictable. However, based upon current trends and expectations regarding commercial electricity\n\n30\n\nrates, we currently expect inflationary increases in rates combined with lower usage resulting in similar utility costs for the remainder of 2024.\n\nLandscaping. Landscaping expenses, which include snow removal costs, increased 2.2%, or $571, and 15.8%, or $11,880, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. The increase in landscaping expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of one-off snow removal and inflationary increases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Landscaping expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact landscaping needs including, among other things, snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events. We currently expect inflationary increases in landscaping expense for the remainder of 2024, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and unpredictable.\n\nMarketing. Marketing expense is comprised principally of internet advertising and the operating costs of our 24/7 kiosk and telephone call and reservation center. Marketing expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors. Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short term in response to these factors. Marketing expense decreased 5.4%, or $4,604, and 1.3%, or $3,420, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023. Marketing expense decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to decreased spending on digital advertising. Based upon current trends in move-ins, move-outs, and occupancies, we currently expect marketing expense to increase at a nominal rate for the remainder of 2024.\n\nGeneral. Other direct store costs include general and administrative expenses incurred at the stores. General expenses include items such as store insurance, business license costs, and the cost of operating each store’s rental office including supplies and telephone and data communication lines. General expenses increased 20.7%, or $19,112, and 38.4%, or $92,729, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increased expense for property insurance, recruitment and training, uniforms, and branded merchandise to support our customer loyalty program. We currently expect moderate increases in direct store costs during the remainder of 2024.\n\nLien Administration. Lien administration expenses increased 21.0%, or $1,142, and 6.6%, or $955, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023.\n\nProperty Tax Expenses at Dolton, IL\n\nLate in the third quarter of 2017, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed by the municipality and separately, our Class 8 tax incentive renewal hearing was held. As a result of those two events, our Dolton, IL property was reassessed at approximately 52% higher and the Class 8 tax incentive was not renewed. These events were applied retroactively to take effect on January 1, 2017. Property tax expenses have increased to $399,000 during 2020, $417,000 during 2021, $532,000 during 2022, and $559,000 during 2023. The Class 8 tax incentive phased out over the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. In 2024, tax relief was granted resulting in an approximate 17.9% reduction in tax liability to the real estate property taxes for our Dolton, IL property. We are continuing to appeal the property tax reassessment and our Class 8 tax incentive renewal status for further tax relief. However, there is no guarantee that either the assessment will be reduced or our Class 8 tax incentive status will be reinstated.\n\nAnalysis of Global Self Storage FFO and AFFO\n\nThe following tables present reconciliation and computation of net income to funds from operations (“FFO”) and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) and earnings per share to FFO and AFFO per share (unaudited):\n\n31\n\nFor the Three Months Ended September 30, | For the Nine Months Ended September 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nNet income | $ | 1,181,657 | $ | 270,758 | $ | 2,039,337 | $ | 1,841,369  \nEliminate items excluded from FFO:  \nUnrealized (gain) loss on marketable equity securities | (499,283 | ) | 411,969 | (403,935 | ) | 165,266  \nDepreciation and amortization | 409,227 | 409,245 | 1,225,290 | 1,224,624  \nFFO attributable to common stockholders | 1,091,601 | 1,091,972 | 2,860,692 | 3,231,259  \nAdjustments:  \nCompensation expense related to stock-based awards | 74,207 | 44,720 | 218,136 | 126,428  \nBusiness development | 2,012 | 5,903 | 4,287 | 11,152  \nAFFO attributable to common stockholders | $ | 1,167,820 | $ | 1,142,595 | $ | 3,083,115 | $ | 3,368,839  \nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders - basic | $ | 0.11 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.17  \nEarnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.02 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.16  \nFFO per share - diluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.26 | $ | 0.29  \nAFFO per share - diluted | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.28 | $ | 0.30  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic | 11,101,705 | 11,048,877 | 11,087,613 | 11,041,578  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted | 11,159,187 | 11,090,674 | 11,127,016 | 11,084,684  \n  \nFFO decreased 0.0%, or $371, and 11.5%, or $370,567, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, versus the same periods in 2023.

In 2020, we completed three expansion / conversion projects at our properties located in Millbrook, NY, McCordsville, IN, and West Henrietta, NY. In 2021 and 2023, we completed conversion projects at our property located in Lima, OH.\n\nIn 2019, the Company broke ground on the Millbrook, NY expansion, which added approximately 11,800 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units. Upon completion in February 2020, the Millbrook, NY store's area occupancy dropped from approximately 88.6% to approximately 45.5%. As of June 30, 2021, the Millbrook, NY store’s total area occupancy was approximately 95.4%.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased space to all-climate-controlled units at the McCordsville, IN property. In April 2020, the Company commenced such conversion, which resulted in a new total of 535 units and 76,360 leasable square feet at the McCordsville, IN property. Upon completion in June 2020, the McCordsville, IN store's total area occupancy dropped from what would have been approximately 97.4% to approximately 79.1%. As of June 30, 2021, the McCordsville, IN store’s total area occupancy was approximately 94.7%.\n\nOur West Henrietta, NY store expansion project, completed in August 2020, added approximately 7,300 leasable square feet of drive-up storage units. Upon completion of the expansion project, West Henrietta, NY’s total area occupancy dropped from approximately 89.6% to approximately 77.9%. As of June 30, 2021, the West Henrietta, NY store’s total area occupancy was approximately 89.1%.\n\nIn 2021, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased spaces to approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In July 2021, the Company completed such conversion, resulting in a new total of 756 units and 96,883 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH property. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 94.8%. This conversion did not constitute a significant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 3,000 leasable square feet of self storage to the property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property.\n\nIn 2022, the Company began reviewing plans to convert certain commercially-leased spaces to approximately 2,500 leasable square feet of all-climate-controlled units at the Lima, OH property. In January 2023, the Company completed such conversion, resulting\n\n32\n\nin a new total of 767 units and 94,928 leasable square feet at the Lima, OH property. Upon completion, total area occupancy was approximately 91.1%. This conversion did not constitute a significant renovation or expansion because it only added approximately 2,500 leasable square feet of self storage to the property. As such, our Lima, OH property remained a same store property.\n\nAnalysis of Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\n\nUnrealized gains and losses on the Company’s investment in marketable equity securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were a gain of $403,935 and a loss of $165,266, respectively. As we continue to acquire and/or develop additional stores, as part of the funding for such activities, we may liquidate our investment in marketable equity securities and potentially realize gains or losses. As of September 30, 2024, our cumulative unrealized gain on marketable equity securities was $2,423,477. There were no realized gains or losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\n\nNot applicable.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures.\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures.\n\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file pursuant to the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\nWe have a disclosure controls and procedures committee, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which meets as necessary and is responsible for considering the materiality of information and determining our disclosure obligations on a timely basis.\n\nThe disclosure controls and procedures committee carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n33\n\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\n\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company or its subsidiaries may be named in legal actions and proceedings. These actions may seek substantial or indeterminate compensatory as well as punitive damages or injunctive relief. We are also subject to governmental or regulatory examinations or investigations.

For any such matters, the Company will seek to include in its financial statements the necessary provisions for losses that it believes are probable and estimable. Furthermore, the Company will seek to evaluate whether there exist losses which may be reasonably possible and, if material, make the necessary disclosures.
