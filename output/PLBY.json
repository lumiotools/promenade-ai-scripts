(NASDAQ: PLBY) (“PLBY Group” or the “Company”), a leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle company and owner of Playboy, one of the most recognizable and iconic brands in the world, today announced financial and operational results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. Comparability is to the same period in the prior year and all periods presented reflect the Company’s Honey Birdette business as a discontinued operation, as appropriate and unless otherwise noted.\n\n**_Comments from Ben Kohn, Chief Executive Officer of PLBY Group_**\n\n“This year we have taken substantial and necessary actions to strengthen our balance sheet and restore Playboy to its iconic roots, establishing a more sustainable path forward. This week, we signed a deal with our existing lenders to restructure our debt, reducing our senior debt from approximately $218 million to approximately $152 million. Related to that, we will issue our lenders $28 million of a new convertible preferred stock. We will be able to redeem the new convertible preferred stock, at our sole option, for either cash (at any time) or common stock at a minimum price of $1.50 per share and a ceiling of $4.50 per share, subject to the terms of the preferred. The restructured debt, coupled with the approximately $30 million in total cash we now have, provides us a stronger financial foundation moving forward.”\n\n“Operationally, we continue to advance our asset-light model. Having closed the Byborg Enterprises investment last week, we are working hard to finalize the strategic licensing agreement with Byborg, with the anticipation of closing by year-end. Successfully completing this transaction will allow us to make other operational changes, which will streamline our business and accelerate our path to meaningful profitability. In addition, we have successfully signed multiple new licensing agreements, and combined with the anticipated $300 million in guaranteed minimums from Byborg over the initial 15 years of the pending agreement, we are establishing a growing baseline of recurring revenue.”\n\n“Simultaneously, we have relaunched Playboy.com, targeting key content verticals, including men’s lifestyle, automotive, sports and travel, that we believe can significantly expand our audience and grow engagement. Playboy remains the quintessential aspirational lifestyle brand, recognized around the world. We are accelerating plans to expand engagement, create exciting events and experiences, and grow our social media presence, all supported by the recently redesigned Playboy.com.”\n\n“As we near the return of the iconic Playboy magazine in early 2025, we do so from a position of growing strength. We are reviving Playboy’s place as a launching pad for talented and beautiful women through a global search for our newest Playmate, kicking off with an eight-city casting tour, culminating in the reveal of the 2024 Playmate of the Year in the new magazine.”\n\n**_Recent Highlights_**\n\n  * This week, PLBY Group signed a deal to restructure its senior debt facility, reducing its outstanding term loans to a principal amount of approximately $152 million. In connection with its debt restructuring, the Company will issue $28 million of a new convertible preferred stock which matures at the end of 2027. The preferred stock includes a 12% annual dividend rate, starting in six months, which will be payable in cash or in-kind, solely at PLBY Group’s discretion. PLBY Group has the right to redeem for cash (at any time) or convert the convertible preferred stock at any time, provided that the five-day volume-weighted average price of PLBY Group’s common stock is $1.50 or above, with a conversion price floor of $1.50 and a cap of $4.50.\n  * Last week, PLBY Group secured a strategic investment from Byborg Enterprises (“Byborg”), a privately held premium online entertainment company that is redefining the future of human interaction and reshaping digital relationships through innovative technology, in which Byborg purchased 14.9 million newly issued, unregistered shares of common stock of PLBY Group for a price of $1.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $22.35 million. The purchased shares are subject to a lock-up period of one year. In connection with the equity purchase, Byborg entered into a standstill agreement capping its total holdings in PLBY Group at 29.99%, and Byborg will receive a seat on the Board of Directors of PLBY, which will also add a new independent director, beginning in 2025.\n  * Concurrently, Byborg and PLBY Group signed a non-binding letter of intent (“LOI”) providing that the parties will work together to negotiate and execute a definitive agreement pursuant to which Byborg would license certain Playboy digital intellectual property and operate certain Playboy digital businesses. Core to the contemplated strategic partnership is pursuing additional new revenue streams, including artificial intelligence services, webcam products and other initiatives which will leverage existing Byborg intellectual property. The LOI includes $20 million in annual minimum guaranteed payments to PLBY Group over the initial 15-year term, for a total of $300 million, as well as a profit share based on performance. PLBY Group and Byborg expect to enter into the definitive agreement prior to year-end.\n\n\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Results_**\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all results are presented on a continuing operations basis and exclude the results of the Honey Birdette business that was classified as discontinued operations as of the third quarter of 2024. Management continues to explore strategic options to divest the Honey Birdette business.\n\n**Total revenue** was $12.9 million compared to $16.3 million in the prior year, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of $3.4 million, or 21%. Substantially all of the decrease was due to a decline in licensing revenue attributable primarily to the termination of two China licensees in late 2023. This was partially offset by growth in the Company’s digital subscriptions and content segment.\n\n**Licensing revenue** was $7.4 million compared to $10.9 million in the prior year, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of $3.5 million, or 32%. The decrease was attributable to China and the termination of two of the Company’s three largest licensing agreements in late 2023.\n\n**Digital Subscriptions and Content revenue** was $5.5 million, up 5% from $5.2 million in the prior year period. An increase in creator platform revenue offset a modest decline in legacy media.\n\n**Net loss from continuing operations** was $33.8 million compared to a net loss of $7.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to impairment charges on intangible assets and the decline in the licensing business.\n\n**Total net loss** was $33.8 million compared to a net loss of $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, due primarily to impairment charges on intangible assets and the decline in the licensing business.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA loss** was $1.8 million compared to positive Adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. This reflects a reduction in licensing revenue due to the termination of two China licensing agreements in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the reversal of accrued commission expense in the prior year period, partially offset by reductions in corporate expenses, reflecting ongoing cost rationalization.\n\n**_Webcast Details_**\n\nPLBY Group will host a webcast at 5 p.m. ET today to discuss the third quarter 2024 results.

The Company’s actual results may differ from their expectations, estimates, and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Words such as “expect”, “estimate”, “project”, “budget”, “forecast”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “may”, “will”, “could”, “should”, “believes”, “predicts”, “potential”, “continue”, and similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.

Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, investors should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, the Company may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, the Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. The Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because not all companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\n\nIn addition to adjusting for non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash charges for the fair value remeasurements of certain liabilities and non-recurring non-cash impairments, asset write-downs and inventory reserve charges, the Company typically adjusts for non-operating expenses and income, such as non-recurring special projects, including the implementation of internal controls, non-recurring gain or loss on the sale of assets, expenses associated with financing activities, and reorganization and severance expenses that result from the elimination or rightsizing of specific business activities or operations.\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Investors should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\n\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s net loss from continued operations to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\n\n**GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation**** _(in thousands)_**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Net loss**|  $| (33,755| )| $| (7,165| )  \n**Adjusted for:**  \n(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax| (43| )| 115  \n**Net loss from continuing operations**| (33,798| )| (7,050| )  \n**Adjusted for:**  \nInterest expense| 6,686| 6,620  \nExpense (benefit) from income taxes| 586| (929| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 1,042| 946  \n**EBITDA**| (25,484| )| (413| )  \n**Adjusted for:**  \nStock-based compensation| 1,502| 540  \nImpairments| 21,707| 392  \nAdjustments| 511| 1,312  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| (1,764| )| $| 1,831  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MDBhN2I3YjEtNjRlZC00OTgyLTk3OTQtNjM5MzkwMDQ3ODc3LTEwMTY5NTA=/tiny/Playboy-Enterprises-Inc-.png)\n"

(NASDAQ: PLBY) (“PLBY Group” or the “Company”), a leading pleasure and leisure lifestyle company and owner of Playboy, one of the most recognizable and iconic brands in the world, today announced financial and operational results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**_Comments from Ben Kohn, Chief Executive Officer of PLBY Group_**\n\n“We have taken significant steps to position Playboy for future success, aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and enhancing our operations. Our senior lenders have agreed to give us an exclusive period of time to repay all of the debt at a significant discount, which would meaningfully reduce total company leverage. To accomplish this, we have engaged a leading investment bank to help secure new financing.”\n\n“In recent months, we made substantial progress to bring one of the most iconic lifestyle brands in all of entertainment into the digital age. Playboy is the quintessential lifestyle brand, with a rich heritage, reaching not only across generations, but across content categories as well. We are confident that by rebuilding key content verticals such as men’s lifestyle, automotive, sports and travel, we can vastly expand the ways in which consumers interact with our brand – through social media, events and experiences, and content on a newly redesigned Playboy.com, which debuted earlier this week. The power of the creator economy is the key to building a successful and relevant content business in today’s rapidly changing media ecosystem, and we plan to partner with creators of all types to produce dynamic, fresh content across all of our distribution channels. We are creating exciting opportunities for advertising and sponsorship partners to reach new consumers by re-establishing Playboy as the premier aspirational lifestyle brand. This new strategy is already delivering results, including a multi-million dollar pipeline of sponsorship deals. A key part of this strategy was revamping our social media accounts, driving nearly 30 million Instagram video views in the past three months alone, according to Emplifi, our social media insights provider.”\n\n“ _Playboy_ magazine, scheduled to return in early 2025, will serve as a powerful promotional tool for our relaunch, and will feature not only Playmate and celebrity collaborations, but also many iconic franchises such as the Playboy Interview, 20 Questions and the Playboy Advisor. Playboy is known for launching the careers of some of the most talented women in the world, and we are reviving that legacy with a global search for our newest Playmate, kicking off with an eight-city casting tour starting next month in New York City and culminating in the reveal of the 2024 Playmate of the Year in the new magazine.”\n\n“The rebuilding of our licensing business continues to progress. In the past few months, we’ve signed multiple new deals, including with a new apparel and accessories licensing partner in China, a global condoms and gel lubricants partner, a new e-commerce shop partner, and multiple other deals, amounting to a total of over $45 million in minimum guarantees over the coming years. Our pipeline continues to grow and we are optimistic about what lies ahead for our licensing business.”\n\n**_Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * Secured an agreement with the Company’s senior lenders to give it an exclusive period of time to repay its senior debt at a significant discount, subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements relating to the amendment and subsequent refinancing of the Company’s senior debt.\n  * Filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a new At-The-Market (“ATM”) program, which will allow the Company to offer its common stock, from time to time, in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings, not to exceed an aggregate amount of $15 million. Any sales pursuant to the ATM will be conducted through Roth Capital Partners as sales agent, although the Company does not plan on executing the ATM at current trading levels of PLBY shares and management will be cognizant of dilution when considering sales in the future.\n\n\n\n**_Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results_**\n\n**Total revenue** was $24.9 million compared to $35.1 million in the prior year period, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of $10.2 million, or 29%. Approximately $1.4 million of the decrease was attributable to the _Playb_ _oy.com_ e-commerce business no longer being operated by the Company in 2024, which was in addition to a $5.0 million decline in licensing revenue attributable primarily to the termination of two China licensees in late 2023. There were also declines at Honey Birdette and in the Company’s legacy digital business.\n\n**Direct-to-consumer revenue** declined $5.2 million, or 26%, year-over-year, to $14.5 million. Revenues from _Playboy.com_ e-commerce declined by $1.4 million, as the Company transitioned it from an owned-and-operated model to a licensing model, while revenue from Honey Birdette decreased by $3.8 million, or 21% year-over-year, due largely to an approximately 50% reduction in the number of days on sale as the Company focuses on brand health and gross margin.\n\n**Licensing revenue** declined $5.0 million, or 49%, year-over-year, to $5.3 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to China and the termination of two of the Company’s three largest licensing agreements in late 2023, which management has already begun to remedy by entering into multiple new licensing agreements in recent months.\n\n**Digital subscriptions and content revenue** was $5.1 million, consistent with the prior year period. An increase in creator platform revenue was offset by a decline in legacy media.\n\n**Net loss from continuing operations** was $16.7 million, an improvement of $115.6 million from a net loss from continuing operations of $132.3 million in the prior year period, as the Company significantly cut costs and expenses and due to a $146.2 million impairment charge in the prior year period which did not recur.\n\n**Total net loss** was $16.7 million, an improvement of $115.2 million from a total net loss of $131.8 million in the second quarter of 2023.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA loss** was $2.9 million, a decline of $2.8 million from a $0.1 million adjusted EBITDA loss during the prior year period. This reflects a $4.9 million decrease in licensing EBITDA due largely to two contracts terminated in China in late 2023, a $0.7 million decline in Honey Birdette EBITDA, partially offset by a $1.9 million reduction in corporate expense and a $1.3 million _Playboy.com_ EBITDA loss in the prior year period that did not recur.\n\nThe Company ended the second quarter with approximately $17 million in cash and cash equivalents.\n\n**_Webcast Details_**\n\nThe Company will host a webcast at 5 p.m. Eastern Time today to discuss the second quarter 2024 financial results. Participants may access the live webcast on the events section of the PLBY Group website at _https://www.plbygroup.com/investors_. \n\n**_About PLBY Group, Inc._**\n\nPLBY Group, Inc. is a global pleasure and leisure company connecting consumers with products, content, and experiences that help them lead more fulfilling lives.

Adjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company believes that the use of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing its financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, investors should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, the Company may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, the Company’s presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. The Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because not all companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\n\nIn addition to adjusting for non-cash stock-based compensation, non-cash charges for the fair value remeasurements of certain liabilities and non-recurring non-cash impairments, asset write-downs and inventory reserve charges, the Company typically adjusts for non-operating expenses and income, such as non-recurring special projects, including the implementation of internal controls, non-recurring gain or loss on the sale of assets, expenses associated with financing activities, and reorganization and severance expenses that result from the elimination or rightsizing of specific business activities or operations.\n\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on the Company’s GAAP results and using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA on a supplemental basis. Investors should review the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA below and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\n\nThe following table reconciles the Company’s net loss from continued operations to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands):\n\n****GAAP Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation**** _(in thousands)_****  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****June 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**  \n**Net loss**|  $| (16,652| )| $| (131,815| )  \n**Adjusted for:**  \n(Income) loss from discontinued operations, net of tax| —| (452| )  \n**Net loss from continuing operations**| (16,652| )| (132,267| )  \n**Adjusted for:**  \nInterest expense| 6,588| 5,757  \nGain on extinguishment of debt| —| (7,980| )  \nExpense (benefit) from income taxes| 616| (8,868| )  \nDepreciation and amortization| 2,511| 1,848  \n**EBITDA**| (6,937| )| (141,510| )  \n**Adjusted for:**  \nStock-based compensation| 2,005| 3,151  \nImpairments| 599| 146,240  \nInventory reserve charges| —| —  \nMandatorily redeemable preferred stock fair value remeasurement| —| (9,523| )  \nWrite-down of capitalized software| —| —  \nAdjustments| 1,397| 1,548  \n**Adjusted EBITDA**|  $| (2,936| )| $| (94| )  \n  \n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MDllZGI4M2EtNGJlNi00MzE3LWFhNjAtNzVmZjNlZTljMzVkLTEwMTY5NTA=/tiny/Playboy-Enterprises-Inc-.png)\n"
