(“H&E” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: HEES) today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Lewistown Rental, a Lewistown, Montana-based equipment rental business and three of its affiliated rental operations in Havre, Glasgow and Great Falls, Montana. Each location serves multiple end markets, including non-residential, industrial and agriculture. The company and its affiliates deploy a diverse fleet of equipment with a total estimated fleet value, as measured by original equipment cost, of $28.5 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, following the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. \n\nBrad Barber, chief executive officer of H&E, stated, “Lewistown Rental, together with its affiliated operations, has demonstrated impressive growth over the past several years by addressing a unique customer base across underserved markets in northern and central Montana, utilizing a diverse and comprehensive mix of equipment.
