NEWMARK 16\n2.TTM Adjusted EBITDA / TTM Interest Expense.\n3.Through share or unit repurchases, dividends, and distributions.\nCertain Revenue Terms Defined\nFee and non-fee revenues\nThe Company’s total revenues include certain Management services revenues that equal their related expenses. These revenues represent fully reimbursable compensation and non-compensation costs recorded as part\nof Newmark's Global Corporate Services (\"GCS\") and Property management businesses. Such revenues therefore have no impact on the Company's GAAP or non-GAAP earnings measures and may be referred to as\n\"Pass through revenues\". The amounts recorded as Pass through revenues are also recorded as \"Pass through expenses\". Newmark's Total revenues also include non-cash gains with respect to originated mortgage\nservicing rights (“OMSRs”), which represent the fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing recognized at commitment, net. Such non-cash gains may also be called \"OMSR revenues.\" Newmark may also\nrefer to Pass through revenues and OMSR revenues together as “Non-fee revenues”, and the remainder of its total revenues as \"Fee revenues“\nManagement services, servicing fees, and other\n\"Servicing and other revenues\" may be called Newmark's \"servicing business\" and includes servicing fees, interest income on loans held for sale, escrow interest, and yield maintenance fees, which all relate primarily to\nNewmark's multifamily GSE/FHA business. \"Management services, servicing fees, and other\" (which may also be referred to as \"recurring revenues\", \"recurring businesses\", or \"management businesses\") includes all\npass through revenues, as well as fees from Newmark's servicing business, GCS, Property Management, its flexible workspace platform, and Valuation & Advisory, as well as all revenues generated by Spring11. Fees\nfrom management services, servicing, and other\" are revenues from all recurring businesses excluding Pass through revenues. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the portion of Spring11's revenues associated with its\nservicing and asset management portfolio were no longer reported under \"Management services\" but were instead recorded as part of \"Servicing and other revenues\" for all periods from the first quarter of 2023 onwards.\nThis change had no impact on the overall line items \"Fees from management services, servicing, and other\" and \"Management services, servicing fees, and other\", or on the Company's consolidated results.\nCapital Markets\n\"Fees from commercial mortgage origination, net\" includes origination fees related to Newmark's multifamily GSE/FHA business (which may be used interchangeably with \"Loan originations related fees and sales\npremiums, net\") and fees from Commercial mortgage brokerage and debt placement. Beginning in the second quarter of 2024 and retrospectively, \"Capital markets\" includes Fees from commercial mortgage origination,\nnet, \"Investment sales\", and \"OMSR revenues\".\nLeasing and Other Commissions\nLeasing and Other Commissions includes fees from landlord (or \"agency\") representation and tenant (or \"occupier\") representation.\nCommission-based Revenues\nNewmark's \"commission-based\" revenues include Leasing and Other Commissions, Fees from commercial mortgage origination, net, Investment sales, and Valuation & Advisory. Brokers and originators in these\nbusinesses (who together may be referred to as \"producers\") and revenue-generating Valuation & Advisory professionals earn a substantial portion, or all their compensation based on their production. Commission-based\nrevenues exclude OMSR revenues, because Newmark does not compensate its professionals based on this non-cash item.\nContractual Business\n\"Contractual business”, which may be used interchangeably with \"contractual services\" or \"contractual revenues\", is defined as business for which the Company has a contract with a client that is generally for a year or\nlonger. Contractual business, when quantified, includes all revenues related to landlord representation (or “agency”) leasing, loan servicing (including escrow interest income), outsourcing (including property management,\nfacilities management, and asset management), and lease administration. It also includes certain fees under contract produced by the Company’s flexible workspace and tenant representation service lines.\nAdditional details on current and historical amounts for certain of Newmark's revenues are available in the Company's quarterly supplemental Excel tables.\nNEWMARK 17\nOther Useful Information\nInformation on Newmark’s Recent Servicing Business Results\nNewmark produced $169.8 million in servicing fees during the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. In addition to servicing fees, the Company generated $94.3 million of other revenues, for a total of $264.1 million of servicing &\nother revenues. These include escrow interest, servicing and asset management fees, interest on loans held for sale, and yield maintenance fees. Multifamily mortgage servicing revenue is stable and recurring in part because of\ngreater call protection versus single family mortgages, and because interest income moves in tandem with interest rates. Over 98% of the Company’s GSE loans include prepayment penalties. Starting in the first quarter of 2024,\nNewmark’s servicing fees also reflect Spring 11’s limited servicing and asset management business, retrospectively from the first quarter of 2023 onwards. Please see “Recurring Revenues” under “Certain Revenue Terms Defined” in\nthe appendix for more information regarding Spring11’s servicing and asset management revenues.\nWe believe that for the industry, commercial and multifamily servicing and asset management companies earn 40 to 50 basis points on their Fannie Mae servicing book, eight to 10 basis points on Freddie Mac loans, approximately 15\nbasis points for FHA loans, and 1 to 3 basis points for limited servicing. The fees for special servicing and asset management can vary depending on a variety of factors. Spring11’s portfolio currently earns closer to the low-end of the\nlatter range but is targeting higher fees over time as it expands its offerings across special servicing and asset management. Limited servicing, special servicing, and asset management together generally produce higher profit margins\nthan Newmark as a whole, but lower profit margins versus GSE/FHA primary servicing. We expect our overall portfolio to continue providing a steady stream of income and cash flow over the life of the serviced loans.\nNewmark’s agency risk sharing portfolio was $31.0 billion and its OLTV was 62% at 9/30/2024. Additionally, between 1999 and 3Q 2024, Berkeley Point’s risk sharing portfolio losses averaged under 2 basis points annually, which is\nmeaningfully lower than the over 40 basis points that servicers typically earn per year. Therefore, Berkeley Point’s cumulative portfolio losses over the past 25.75 years were significantly less than the $264.1 million of revenues that\nour overall servicing portfolio generated over the 12 months ended September 30, 2024.\nSignature Transactions\nThe book value of the overall loan portfolio was approximately $60 billion when Newmark was retained as an advisor by the FDIC and approximately $53 billion when the Company began marketing the loans, while the completed\ntransactions had a combined notional value of $39.5 billion. The latter figure consisted of $21.7 billion of equity placements recorded as part of the Company's investment sales volumes and $17.8 billion of loan sales recorded as\nmortgage brokerage. A portion of the loans did not relate to real estate. For more information, please see various announcements, press releases, and other information on the FDIC website, including: \"FDIC Announces Upcoming\nSale of the Loan Portfolio from the Former Signature Bank, New York, New York\", \"SIGF-23 Sale Announcement $18.5 Billion All Cash Loan Sale\", \"SIGCRE-23 Sale Announcement $33.22 Billion Commercial Real Estate Loan\nPortfolio\", \"FDIC Signature Bank Receivership Sells 20 Percent Equity Interest in Entity Holding $9 Billion Rent-Stabilized / Rent-Controlled Multifamily Loans\", \"FDIC Signature Bridge Bank Receivership Sells Five Percent Equity\nInterest in Entities Holding $5.8 Billion of Rent-Stabilized / Rent-Controlled Multifamily Loans\", and \"FDIC Signature Bridge Bank Receivership Sells 20 Percent Equity Interest in Entity Holding $16.8 Billion of Commercial Real Estate\nLoans\".\nRecent Acquisitions and Hires\nFor additional information about key hires thus far in 2024, see press releases including: \"Newmark Expands Germany Presence, Naming Top Industry Leader Marcus Lütgering as Country Head to Drive Growth and Strategy\";\n\"Newmark Adds Steve Williamson and Matthew Kang to UK & EMEA Capital Markets Team\"; \"Newmark Hires Evan Williams as Head of Affordable Housing Debt & Structured Finance, Expanding Client Service Offerings\"; \"Newmark\nHires Bryan Beel as Valuation & Advisory Multifamily Specialty Practice Leader\"; \"Newmark Announces Valuation & Advisory has Opened in Singapore\"; \"Newmark Lands Leading National Affordable Housing Advisory Team\",\n\"Newmark Launches Paris Office, Bolstering Global Expansion with Key Talent Additions\", \"Newmark Hires Matthew Featherstone as Head of Debt & Structured Finance for the UK and Europe\", and \"Newmark Expands Debt Platform\nin Partnership with U.S. Capital Markets Team, Industry Powerhouse Jonathan Firestone to Join and Co-Head\".

The firm generated a majority of its fiscal year\n2022 total revenues from management services, and has particular strength in capital markets, corporate real estate advisory, planning and development, tenant representation, landlord (or agency) leasing, and valuation. For the\ntrailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023, MSCI ranked Gerald Eve at number three for U.K. industrial investment sales.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Newmark purchased the approximately 49% of Spring11 that it did not already own, having held a controlling stake since 2017. The acquisition of the balance of Spring11 significantly increased the size of\nthe Company's overall servicing and asset management portfolio. Spring11 provides commercial real estate due diligence, consulting, asset management and limited servicing, as well as advisory services to a variety of clients,\nincluding lenders, investment banks and investors. For more information on these acquisitions, please see the Company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and/or the\nfollowing the press release on its website: \"Newmark Acquires Top UK-Based Real Estate Advisory Firm Gerald Eve\".\nNEWMARK 18\nOther Useful Information (continued)\nRecent Notable Transactions\nFor additional information about certain recent notable transactions for which Newmark acted as an advisor, please see press releases including: \"Newmark Advises on $3.4 Billion Joint Venture on One Million-Square-Foot Texas\nData Center\"; \"Newmark Advises on $5 Billion Joint Venture Partnership to Develop AI/High-Power Computer (HPC) Data Centers Across the U.S.\"; and \"Newmark Secures $985 Million Financing on Behalf of 80 Clarkson\nDevelopers in New York City.\" Please also see additional releases and/or articles with respect to year-to-date transactions and client wins in the \"Media\" section of Newmark's main website.\nCash Generated by the Business\nCash generated by the business means \"Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding loan originations and sales\", before the impact of cash used for \"Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees\nand partners\" (which Newmark considers to be a form of investment, but which is recorded as part of Cash Flows from Operating Activities) and the impact of cash used with respect to the 2021 Equity Event.

The quarterly results presentation and\n10-Q contain or will include detailed sources for such information.\nFigures for Newmark and its Peers\nWith respect to any revenue or earnings comparisons versus “the industry”, “competitors”, and/or “peers”: Newmark’s 2011 revenues are based on unaudited full year 2011 total revenues for Newmark & Company Real Estate, Inc.,\n(“Newmark & Co.”). 2011 is the year we were acquired by our former parent company, BGC Partners, Inc. (\"BGC\", which is now officially known as BGC Group, Inc. BGC IPOed us in 2017 and spun us off in 2018.) The peers\nincluded in the 2011 through 2023 compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) are US tickers CBRE, CIGI, JLL, MMI, and WD (in all cases using USD), and UK ticker symbol SVS (in all cases using GBP). These companies generated\ntotal revenue CAGRs of between approximately 6% and 17% from 2011 through 2023, or a simple mean of 12%. Only some of these peers reported net or fee revenues consistent with more recent methodology during this period,\ntherefore one cannot use these metrics in calculations for periods prior to 2019. In addition, US ticker CWK did not report revenues for periods before 2015 and is therefore excluded. For some years, the impact of FASB topic ASC\n606 increased GAAP revenues for Newmark and certain peers.\nWith respect to Adjusted EBITDA growth: For all periods, NMRK is compared only with its full service peers, which are US tickers CBRE, CIGI, CWK, and JLL. Historical Adjusted EBITDA amounts are based on each of these\ncompanies' respective disclosures and definitions. For future periods, the Adjusted EBITDA figures for the full service peers are based on consensus estimates as per FactSet as of November 12, 2024. NMRK Adjusted EBITDA\nfigures are based on the mid-point of our 2024 outlook or the low-end of our 2026 target, both as of November 5, 2024.\nOther Items\nInvestors may find the following information useful: (i) Throughout this document, certain other reclassifications may have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current presentation and to show results on a\nconsistent basis across periods.

Of this $2 trillion, Newmark Research believes that ~$529 billion are troubled. We expect these\nmaturities will eventually translate into higher sales and acquisition financing as owners and lenders address increased scrutiny and the potential for higher-for-longer interest rates.\n- Of these maturities, we believe that approximately:\n- 1/3 will likely result in a loan sale or property sale.\n- 1/3 will need assistance with restructurings and/or recapitalizations.\n- 1/3 will likely require an advisor to help find new lenders.\n- We also expect this wall of maturities to drive demand for Newmark’s other services, including Leasing, Property Management, Valuation & Advisory, and Servicing.\nSources: Newmark Research, Trepp, and/or the MBA. Data for 2016-2022 is based on Trepp. Data from 2023 onward is based on the MBA’s 2023 loan maturities published in February 2024. Some maturities that are shown in 2024 may have been rolled over to 2025.\n1. Newmark Research used the following methodology: The loans are marked-to-market using an average of cumulative changes in the Dow Jones REIT sector price indices, REIT sector enterprise value indices and Green Street sector CPPI. The $1.3T covers the 2024 to 2033 NEWMARK 21\nmaturity period, of which Newmark Research estimates $670B matures between 2024-2026. This analysis excludes other property types included in the Trepp and MBA figures, such as hotel and healthcare. The Trepp and MBA data excludes loans for acquisitions,\ndevelopment, and construction, as well as loans collateralized by owner-occupied commercial properties.\nReturn to Workplace Continues to Improve Year-Over-Year\nWhile workplace utilization has not reached pre-pandemic levels, year-over-year change suggests improvement\nAs a % of 2019 levels\n81%\n76% 78% 77%\n73%\n69% 69%\n67%\n64% 65%\n52%\n47%\nFreespace (Americas) SWAA* Placer.ai (U.S.) Kastle U.S. Freespace (APAC) Freespace (EMEA)\n3Q 2023 3Q 2024\n- While each of the above measures use a different methodology, they all agree that workspace utilization continued to show improvement in 3Q 2024.\n- Most of these measures climbed to post-pandemic highs at some point this year, which should continue to benefit our office-focused service lines.\nSources:\nKastle: Data is from Bloomberg, as of 10/11/2024.

The definitions of these and other non-GAAP terms are below. The Company has made certain clarifications of\nand/or changes to its non-GAAP measures, including “Calculation of Non-Compensation Expense Adjustments for Adjusted Earnings” that will be applicable for reporting periods beginning with the third quarter of 2023 and thereafter,\nas described below. Historically, Adjusted Earnings excluded gains or charges related to resolutions of litigation, disputes, investigations, or enforcement matters that are generally non-recurring, exceptional, or unusual, or similar items\nthat management believes do not best reflect Newmark’s underlying operating performance. To help management and investors best assess Newmark’s underlying operating performance and for the Company to best facilitate\nstrategic planning, beginning with the third quarter of 2023 and thereafter, calculations of Adjusted Earnings will also exclude unaffiliated third-party professional fees and expense related to these items. Newmark has not modified any\nprior period non-GAAP measures, as it has determined such amounts were immaterial to previously reported results.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS DEFINED\nNewmark uses non-GAAP financial measures, including “Adjusted Earnings before noncontrolling interests and taxes” and “Post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders”, which are supplemental measures of operating\nresults used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Newmark believes that Adjusted Earnings best reflect the operating earnings generated by the Company on a\nconsolidated basis and are the earnings which management considers when managing its business. As compared with “Income (loss) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests” and “Net income (loss) for fully diluted shares”,\nboth prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted Earnings calculations primarily exclude certain non-cash items and other expenses that generally do not involve the receipt or outlay of cash by the Company and/or which do not\ndilute existing stockholders, as well as certain gains and charges that management believes do not best reflect the underlying operating performance of Newmark. Adjusted Earnings is calculated by taking the most comparable GAAP\nmeasures and making adjustments for certain items with respect to compensation expenses, non-compensation expenses, and other income, as discussed below.\nCALCULATIONS OF COMPENSATION ADJUSTMENTS FOR ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\nTreatment of Equity-Based Compensation under Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nThe Company’s Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA measures exclude all GAAP charges included in the line item “Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs” (or “equity-\nbased compensation” for purposes of defining the Company’s non-GAAP results) as recorded on the Company’s GAAP Consolidated Statements of Operations and GAAP Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These GAAP\nequity-based compensation charges reflect the following items:\n- Charges with respect to grants of exchangeability, which reflect the right of holders of limited partnership units with no capital accounts, such as LPUs and PSUs, to exchange these units into shares of common stock, or into\npartnership units with capital accounts, such as HDUs, as well as cash paid with respect to taxes withheld or expected to be owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. The withholding taxes related to the exchange of certain non-\nexchangeable units without a capital account into either common stock or partnership units with a capital account may be funded by the redemption of preferred units such as PPSUs.\nNEWMARK 30\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\n- Charges with respect to preferred units. Any preferred units would not be included in the Company’s fully diluted share count because they cannot be made exchangeable into shares of common stock and are\nentitled only to a fixed distribution. Preferred units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units that may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the grant of\nshares of common stock at ratios designed to cover any withholding taxes expected to be paid. The Company believes that this is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of\nissuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares, to pay applicable withholding taxes. GAAP equity-based compensation charges with respect to the grant of an\noffsetting amount of common stock or partnership units with capital accounts in connection with the redemption of non-exchangeable units, including PSUs and LPUs.\n- GAAP equity-based compensation charges with respect to the grant of an offsetting amount of common stock or partnership units with capital accounts in connection with the redemption of non-exchangeable\nunits, including PSUs and LPUs.\n- Charges related to amortization of restricted stock units (“RSUs”), limited partnership units, restricted stock awards, other equity-based awards.\n- Charges related to grants of equity awards, including common stock, RSUs, restricted stock awards, or partnership units with capital accounts.\n- Allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs. Such allocations represent the pro-rata portion of post-tax GAAP earnings available to such unit holders.\nThe amount of certain quarterly equity-based compensation charges is based upon the Company’s estimate of such expected charges during the annual period, as described further below under “Methodology for\nCalculating Adjusted Earnings Taxes”.\nVirtually all of Newmark’s key executives and producers have equity or partnership stakes in the Company and its subsidiaries and generally receive deferred equity or limited partnership units as part of their\ncompensation. A significant percentage of Newmark’s fully diluted shares are owned by its executives, partners, and employees. The Company issues limited partnership units, RSUs, restricted stock, as well as\nother forms of equity-based compensation, including grants of exchangeability into shares of common stock, to provide liquidity to its employees, to align the interests of its employees and management with those\nof common stockholders, to help motivate and retain key employees, and to encourage a collaborative culture that drives cross-selling and growth.\nAll share equivalents that are part of the Company’s equity-based compensation program, including REUs, PSUs, LPUs, certain HDUs, and other units that may be made exchangeable into common stock, as well\nas RSUs (which are recorded using the treasury stock method), are included in the fully diluted share count when issued or at the beginning of the subsequent quarter after the date of grant. Generally, limited\npartnership units (other than preferred units) are expected to be paid a pro-rata distribution based on Newmark’s calculation of Adjusted Earnings per fully diluted share.\nCertain Other Compensation-Related Items under Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nNewmark also excludes various other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance for the given period from its calculation of Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted\nEBITDA. These may include compensation-related items with respect to cost-saving initiatives, such as severance charges incurred in connection with headcount reductions as part of broad restructuring and/or cost\nsavings plans.\nThe Company also excludes compensation charges related to non-cash GAAP gains attributable to originated mortgage servicing rights (“OMSRs”) because these gains are also excluded from Adjusted Earnings and\nAdjusted EBITDA. OMSRs represent the fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing recognized at commitment, net.\nNNEEWWMMAARRKK 31\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\nExcluded Compensation-Related Items with Respect to the 2021 Equity Event under Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nNewmark does not view the cash GAAP compensation charges related to 2021 Equity Event (the \"Impact of the 2021 Equity Event\") as being reflective of its ongoing operations. These consisted of charges relating\nto cash paid to independent contractors for their withholding taxes and the cash redemption of HDUs. These had been recorded as expenses based on Newmark's previous non-GAAP definitions, but were excluded\nin the recast non-GAAP results beginning in the third quarter of 2021 for the following reasons:\n– But for the 2021 Equity Event, the items comprising such charges would have otherwise been settled in shares and been recorded as equity-based compensation in future periods, as is the Company's normal\npractice. Had this occurred, such amounts would have been excluded from Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA and would also have resulted in higher fully diluted share counts, all else equal.\n– Newmark views the fully diluted share count reduction related to the 2021 Equity Event to be economically similar to the common practice among public companies of issuing the net amount of common shares\nto employees for their vested stock-based compensation, selling a portion of the gross shares pay applicable withholding taxes, and separately making open market repurchases of common shares.\n– There was nothing comparable to the 2021 Equity Event in 2020 and nothing similar is currently contemplated after 2021. Accordingly, the only prior period recast with respect to the 2021 Equity Event was the\nsecond quarter of 2021.\nCalculation of Non-Compensation Expense Adjustments for Adjusted Earnings\nNewmark’s calculation of pre-tax Adjusted Earnings excludes GAAP gains or charges related to the following:\n– Non-cash amortization of intangibles with respect to acquisitions.\n– Other acquisition-related costs, including unaffiliated third-party professional fees and expenses.\n– Resolutions of non-recurring, exceptional or unusual gains or charges related to resolutions of litigation, disputes, investigations, or enforcement matters that are generally non-recurring, exceptional, or unusual,\nor similar items that management believes do not best reflect Newmark’s underlying operating performance, including related unaffiliated third-party professional fees and expenses.\n– Non-cash gains attributable to OMSRs.\n– Non-cash amortization of mortgage servicing rights (which Newmark refers to as “MSRs”). Under GAAP, the Company recognizes OMSRs equal to the fair value of servicing rights retained on mortgage loans\noriginated and sold. Subsequent to the initial recognition at fair value, MSRs are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value and amortized in proportion to the net servicing revenue expected to be\nearned. However, it is expected that any cash received with respect to these servicing rights, net of associated expenses, will increase Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA in future periods.\n– Various other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance for the given period, including non-compensation-related charges incurred as part of broad\nrestructuring and/or cost savings plans. Such GAAP items may include charges for exiting leases and/or other long-term contracts as part of cost-saving initiatives, as well as non-cash impairment charges\nrelated to assets, goodwill, and/or intangible assets created from acquisitions.\nNEWMARK 32\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\nCalculation of Other income (loss) for Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted Earnings calculations also exclude certain other non-cash, non-dilutive, and/or non-economic items, which may in some periods include:\n– Unusual, non-ordinary or non-recurring gains or charges.\n– Non-cash GAAP asset impairment charges.\n– Gains or losses on divestitures.\n– The impact of any unrealized non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses on “Other income (loss)” related to the variable share forward agreements with respect to Newmark’s receipt of the payments from\nNasdaq, Inc. (“Nasdaq”), in 2021 and 2022 and the 2020 Nasdaq payment (the “Nasdaq Forwards”).\n– Mark-to-market adjustments for non-marketable investments.\n– Certain other non-cash, non-dilutive, and/or non-economic items.\nDue to Nasdaq’s sale of its U.S. fixed income business in the second quarter of 2021, the Nasdaq Earn-out and related Forward settlements were accelerated, less certain previously disclosed adjustments.\nBecause these shares were originally expected to be received over a 15 year period ending in 2027, the Earn-out had been included in calculations of Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA under Newmark's\nprevious non-GAAP methodology. Due to the acceleration of the Earn-out and the Nasdaq Forwards, the Company now views results excluding certain items related to the Earn-out to be a better reflection of the\nunderlying performance of Newmark’s ongoing operations. Therefore, beginning with the third quarter of 2021, other income (loss) for Adjusted Earnings and Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of the\nbelow items from relevant periods. These items may collectively be referred to as the \"Impact of Nasdaq\".\n– Realized gains related to the accelerated receipt on June 25, 2021, of Nasdaq shares.\n– Realized gains or losses and unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses with respect to Nasdaq shares received prior to the Earn-out acceleration.\n– The impact of any unrealized non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses on “Other income (loss)” related to the Nasdaq Forwards. This item was historically excluded under the previous non-GAAP\ndefinitions.\n– Other items related to the Earn-out.\nNewmark's calculations of non-GAAP “Other income (loss)” for certain prior periods includes dividend income on its Nasdaq shares, as these dividends contributed to cash flow and were generally correlated to\nNewmark's interest expense on short term borrowing against such shares. As Newmark sold 100% of these shares between the third quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, both its interest expense and\ndividend income declined accordingly.\nNEWMARK 33\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\nMETHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING ADJUSTED EARNINGS TAXES\nAlthough Adjusted Earnings are calculated on a pre-tax basis, Newmark also reports post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted shareholders. The Company defines post-tax Adjusted Earnings to fully diluted\nshareholders as pre-tax Adjusted Earnings reduced by the non-GAAP tax provision described below and net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest for Adjusted Earnings.\nThe Company calculates its tax provision for post-tax Adjusted Earnings using an annual estimate similar to how it accounts for its income tax provision under GAAP. To calculate the quarterly tax provision under\nGAAP, Newmark estimates its full fiscal year GAAP Income (loss) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests and the expected inclusions and deductions for income tax purposes, including expected equity-\nbased compensation during the annual period. The resulting annualized tax rate is applied to Newmark’s quarterly GAAP income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests. At the end of the annual period,\nthe Company updates its estimate to reflect the actual tax amounts owed for the period.\nTo determine the non-GAAP tax provision, Newmark first adjusts pre-tax Adjusted Earnings by recognizing any, and only, amounts for which a tax deduction applies under applicable law. The amounts include\ncharges with respect to equity-based compensation, certain charges related to employee loan forgiveness, certain net operating loss carryforwards when taken for statutory purposes, and certain charges related to\ntax goodwill amortization. These adjustments may also reflect timing and measurement differences, including treatment of employee loans, changes in the value of units between the dates of grants of\nexchangeability and the date of actual unit exchange, changes in the value of RSUs and/or restricted stock awards between the date of grant and the date the award vests, variations in the value of certain deferred\ntax assets and liabilities, and the different timing of permitted deductions for tax under GAAP and statutory tax requirements.\nAfter application of these adjustments, the result is the Company’s taxable income for its pre-tax Adjusted Earnings, to which Newmark then applies the statutory tax rates to determine its non-GAAP tax provision.\nNewmark views the effective tax rate on pre-tax Adjusted Earnings as equal to the amount of its non-GAAP tax provision divided by the amount of pre-tax Adjusted Earnings.\nGenerally, the most significant factor affecting this non-GAAP tax provision is the amount of charges relating to equity-based compensation. Because the charges relating to equity-based compensation are\ndeductible in accordance with applicable tax laws, increases in such charges have the effect of lowering the Company’s non-GAAP effective tax rate and thereby increasing its post-tax Adjusted Earnings.\nNewmark incurs income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure, and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of its subsidiaries. Certain of the Company’s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are\nsubject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (“UBT”) in New York City. Any U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the unit\nholders rather than with the partnership entity. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes on the Company’s allocable share of the U.S. results of\noperations. Outside of the U.S., Newmark is expected to operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes. For these reasons, taxes for Adjusted Earnings are expected to be\npresented to show the tax provision the consolidated Company would expect to pay if 100% of earnings were taxed at global corporate rates.\nCALCULATIONS OF PRE- AND POST-TAX ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nNewmark’s pre-tax Adjusted Earnings and post-tax Adjusted Earnings per share calculations assume either that:\n- The fully diluted share count includes the shares related to any dilutive instruments, but excludes the associated expense, net of tax, when the impact would be dilutive; or.\n- The fully diluted share count excludes the shares related to these instruments, but includes the associated expense, net of tax, when the impact would be anti-dilutive.\nNEWMARK 34\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\nThe share count for Adjusted Earnings excludes certain shares and share equivalents expected to be issued in future periods but not yet eligible to receive dividends and/or distributions. Each quarter, the\ndividend payable to Newmark’s stockholders, if any, is expected to be determined by the Company’s Board of Directors with reference to a number of factors. Newmark may also pay a pro-rata distribution of net\nincome to limited partnership units, as well as to Cantor for its noncontrolling interest.\nThe declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by the Company will be at the discretion of its Board of Directors using the fully diluted share count. For more information on any\nshare count adjustments, see the table of this document and/or the Company’s most recent financial results press release titled “Fully Diluted Weighted-Average Share Count for GAAP and Adjusted Earnings.”\nMANAGEMENT RATIONALE FOR USING ADJUSTED EARNINGS\nNewmark’s calculation of Adjusted Earnings excludes the items discussed above because they are either non-cash in nature, because the anticipated benefits from the expenditures are not expected to be fully\nrealized until future periods, or because the Company views results excluding these items as a better reflection of the underlying performance of Newmark’s ongoing operations.\nManagement uses Adjusted Earnings in part to help it evaluate, among other things, the overall performance of the Company’s business and to make decisions with respect to the Company’s operations. The term\n“Adjusted Earnings” should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss). The Company views Adjusted Earnings as a metric that is not indicative of liquidity, or the cash available to\nfund its operations, but rather as a performance measure. Pre- and post-tax Adjusted Earnings, as well as related measures, are not intended to replace the Company’s presentation of its GAAP financial results.\nHowever, management believes that these measures help provide investors with a clearer understanding of Newmark’s financial performance and offer useful information to both management and investors regarding\ncertain financial and business trends related to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Management believes that the GAAP and Adjusted Earnings measures of financial performance should be\nconsidered together.\nFor more information regarding Adjusted Earnings, see the sections of this document and/or the Company’s most recent financial results press release titled \"Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Common\nStockholders to Adjusted Earnings Before Noncontrolling Interests and Taxes and GAAP Fully Diluted EPS to Post-Tax Adjusted EPS”, including the related footnotes, for details about how Newmark’s non-GAAP\nresults are reconciled to those under GAAP.\nNEWMARK 35\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\nADJUSTED EBITDA DEFINED\nNewmark also provides an additional non-GAAP financial performance measure, “Adjusted EBITDA”, which it defines as GAAP “Net income (loss) available to common stockholders”, adjusted for the following items:\n– Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest.\n– Provision (benefit) for income taxes.\n– OMSR revenue.\n– MSR amortization.\n– Compensation charges related to OMSRs.\n– Fixed asset depreciation and intangible asset amortization.\n– Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\n– Various other GAAP items that management views as not reflective of the Company’s underlying performance for the given period. These may include compensation-related items with respect to cost-saving\ninitiatives, such as severance charges incurred in connection with headcount reductions as part of broad restructuring and/or cost savings plans; charges for exiting leases and/or other long-term contracts as\npart of cost-saving initiatives; and non-cash impairment charges related to assets, goodwill and/or intangibles created from acquisitions.\n– Other non-cash, non-dilutive, and/or non-economic items, which may, in certain periods, include the impact of any unrealized non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses on “other income (loss)” related to the\nNasdaq Forwards, as well as mark-to-market adjustments for non-marketable investments.\n– Interest expense.\n– The Impact of Nasdaq and the Impact of the 2021 Equity Event, (together, the \"Impact of Nasdaq and the 2021 Equity Event\"), which are defined above.\nNEWMARK 36\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\nMANAGEMENT RATIONALE FOR USING ADJUSTED EBITDA\nNewmark’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items discussed above because they are either non-cash in nature, because the anticipated benefits from the expenditures are not expected to be fully\nrealized until future periods, or because the Company views excluding these items as a better reflection of the underlying performance Newmark’s ongoing operations. The Company’s management believes that its\nAdjusted EBITDA measure is useful in evaluating Newmark’s operating performance, because the calculation of this measure generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects\nof capital spending and acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions. Such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall\noperating performance. As a result, the Company’s management uses this measure to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes. Newmark believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to\ninvestors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of the Company’s financial results and operations.\nSince Newmark’s Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, investors should use this measure in addition to GAAP measures of net income when analyzing Newmark’s operating\nperformance. Because not all companies use identical EBITDA calculations, the Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore,\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow or GAAP cash flow from operations, because the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain cash requirements, such as tax and debt\nservice payments.\nFor more information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, see the section of this document and/or the Company’s most recent financial results press release titled “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA”,\nincluding the related footnotes, for details about how Newmark’s non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP.\nLIQUIDITY DEFINED\nNewmark may also use a non-GAAP measure called “liquidity”. The Company considers liquidity to be comprised of the sum of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and reverse repurchase agreements\n(if any), less securities lent out in securities loaned transactions and repurchase agreements. The Company considers liquidity to be an important metric for determining the amount of cash that is available or that\ncould be readily available to the Company on short notice. For more information regarding liquidity, see the section of this document and/or the Company’s most recent financial results press release titled “Liquidity\nAnalysis”, including any related footnotes, for details about how Newmark’s non-GAAP results are reconciled to those under GAAP.\nNET LEVERAGE DEFINED\nNewmark may also use a non-GAAP measure called \"net leverage.“ \"Net debt\", when used, is defined as total corporate debt (which excludes Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored\nEnterprises), net of cash or, if applicable, total liquidity, while \"net leverage\", when used, equals net debt divided by trailing twelve month Adjusted EBITDA.\nTIMING OF OUTLOOK FOR CERTAIN GAAP AND NON-GAAP ITEMS\nNewmark anticipates providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP revenues and for certain non-GAAP measures from time to time.\nHowever, the Company does not anticipate providing an outlook for other GAAP results. This is because certain GAAP items, which are excluded from Adjusted Earnings and/or Adjusted EBITDA, are difficult to\nforecast with precision before the end of each period. The Company therefore believes that it is not possible for it to have the required information necessary to forecast GAAP results or to quantitatively reconcile\nGAAP forecasts to non-GAAP forecasts with sufficient precision without unreasonable efforts. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. The\nrelevant items that are difficult to predict on a quarterly and/or annual basis with precision and may materially impact the Company’s GAAP results include, but are not limited, to the following:\nNEWMARK\nNEWMARK 37\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(continued)\n- Certain equity-based compensation charges that may be determined at the discretion of management.\n- Unusual, non-ordinary, or non-recurring items.\n- The impact of gains or losses on certain marketable securities, as well as any gains or losses related to associated mark-to-market movements and/or hedging. These items are calculated using period-end\nclosing prices.\n- Non-cash asset impairment charges, which are calculated and analyzed based on the period-end values of the underlying assets. These amounts may not be known until after period-end.\n- Acquisitions, dispositions, and/or resolutions of litigation, disputes, investigations, enforcement matters, or similar items, which are fluid and unpredictable in nature.\nTIMING OF OUTLOOK FOR CERTAIN GAAP AND NON-GAAP ITEMS\nNewmark anticipates providing forward-looking guidance for GAAP revenues and for certain non-GAAP measures from time to time.\nHowever, the Company does not anticipate providing an outlook for other GAAP results.
