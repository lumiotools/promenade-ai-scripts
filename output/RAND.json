Penberthy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rand. “The sale of SciAps, which netted us $13.1 million in total proceeds, and the sale of our remaining BDC holdings, which generated a realized gain, not only delivered substantial returns but also allowed us to reduce debt and improve liquidity. With over $24 million in total liquidity, we are well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. Following the closing of the SciAps transaction, we have further transitioned the portfolio closer to a targeted debt-focused portfolio, and will continue to focus on mezzanine debt investments, which we believe will help in delivering strong returns and supporting consistent shareholder dividends.” \n\n**Third Quarter Highlights** _(compared with the prior-year period unless otherwise noted)_\n\n  * Total investment income grew $477,000, or 27%, to $2.2 million, which reflected strong growth of interest from portfolio companies given the origination of five new debt instruments over the last year. Also contributing to the total investment income growth was an increase in fee income. \n  * Total expenses were $1.3 million compared with $810,000 in last year’s third quarter. The change largely reflects a $354,000 increase in capital gains incentive fee expense and a $178,000 increase in the income based incentive fee expense payable to the Company’s external investment advisor. The Company had lower interest expense of $46,000 given the debt pay down during the quarter. \n  * Adjusted expenses, which exclude capital gains incentive fees and is a non-GAAP financial measure, were $1.0 million compared with $851,000 in the third quarter of 2023. _See the attached description of this non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliation table for adjusted expenses._\n  * Net investment income was $887,000, or $0.34 per share, compared with $799,000, or $0.31 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net investment income per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the capital gains incentive fee accrual expense, was $0.46 per share, up 59% from $0.29 per share in last year’s third quarter. _See the attached description of this non-GAAP financial measure and reconciliation table for adjusted net investment income per share._\n\n\n\n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Rand’s portfolio included investments with a fair value of $75.0 million across 22 portfolio businesses. This was a decrease of $2.1 million, or 3%, from December 31, 2023, and reflected new and follow-on investments and valuation adjustments in multiple portfolio companies, offset by the SciAps exit, stock sales and other portfolio company loan repayments. At September 30, 2024, Rand’s portfolio was comprised of approximately 74% in debt investments and 26% in equity investments in private companies. The annualized weighted average yield of debt investments, which includes PIK interest, was 13.8% at September 30, 2024, compared with 13.6% at the end of 2023. \n\n_Third quarter 2024:_\n\n  * Funded a follow-on debt investment of $125,000 in ITA Acquisition, LLC. Rand’s total debt and equity investment in ITA Acquisition, LLC had a fair value of $4.9 million at quarter-end. \n  * Received $13.1 million from the previously announced sale of portfolio company SciAps, Inc., which included a realized gain of $7.7 million. The proceeds from the sale payable at closing to Rand consisted of $2.1 million in debt repayment, $165,000 in interest income and loan-related fees, and $10.8 million in equity return. These totals reflect $244,000 held in transaction-related escrows. \n  * Sold remaining shares in two publicly traded BDCs for total proceeds of $1.3 million, which netted a realized gain of $249,000. \n  * Exited investment in Mezmeriz, realizing a tax loss on an equity investment having a fair value of zero. \n\n\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nCash was $3.4 million at September 30, 2024. During the quarter, Rand utilized the proceeds from the portfolio company sale and cash on hand to reduce its outstanding borrowings by $13.3 million, leaving a principal balance of $3.9 million on its existing $25.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024. The outstanding borrowings carried an interest rate of 8.46% at quarter-end. \n\nThe Company did not repurchase any outstanding common stock during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Dividends**\n\nOn July 31, 2024, Rand declared its regular quarterly cash dividend distribution of $0.29 per share. The cash dividend was paid during the third quarter to shareholders of record as of August 30, 2024. Rand’s fourth quarter dividend announcement is expected in early December. \n\n**Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nRand will host a conference call and webcast on Wednesday November 6, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Eastern Time, to review its financial results.

          "content": "November 6, 2024\nRand Capital Reports 27% Increase in\nTotal Investment Income for Third Quarter\n2024, Supported by Strategic Debt\nPortfolio Growth\nTotal investment income rose 27% to $2.2 million for the quarter compared with\nthe third quarter last year, driven by strong growth in interest income from an\nexpanded portfolio of debt investments\nNet asset value per share (“NAV”) increased to $27.29, up 3% from June 30, 2024\nand 16% higher than year-end 2023\n$13.1 million received from the sale of portfolio company SciAps, Inc. with\nproceeds used to reduce debt balance\nPaid a quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share for third quarter 2024\nBUFFALO, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rand Capital Corporation (Nasdaq: RAND) (“Rand”\nor the “Company”), a business development company providing alternative financing for\nlower middle market companies, announced its results for the third quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\n\"Our third quarter results reflect the strength of our investment strategy, highlighted by a\n27% increase in total investment income, driven by the growth in our debt portfolio,”\ncommented Daniel P. Penberthy, President and Chief Executive Officer of Rand. “The sale\nof SciAps, which netted us $13.1 million in total proceeds, and the sale of our remaining\nBDC holdings, which generated a realized gain, not only delivered substantial returns but\nalso allowed us to reduce debt and improve liquidity. With over $24 million in total liquidity,\nwe are well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. Following the closing of the\nSciAps transaction, we have further transitioned the portfolio closer to a targeted debt-\nfocused portfolio, and will continue to focus on mezzanine debt investments, which we\nbelieve will help in delivering strong returns and supporting consistent shareholder\ndividends.”\nThird Quarter Highlights (compared with the prior-year period unless otherwise noted)\nTotal investment income grew $477,000, or 27%, to $2.2 million, which reflected\nstrong growth of interest from portfolio companies given the origination of five new debt\ninstruments over the last year. Also contributing to the total investment income growth\nwas an increase in fee income.\nTotal expenses were $1.3 million compared with $810,000 in last year’s third quarter.\nThe change largely reflects a $354,000 increase in capital gains incentive fee expense\nand a $178,000 increase in the income based incentive fee expense payable to the\nCompany’s external investment advisor. The Company had lower interest expense of\n$46,000 given the debt pay down during the quarter.\nAdjusted expenses, which exclude capital gains incentive fees and is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure, were $1.0 million compared with $851,000 in the third quarter of\n2023. See the attached description of this non-GAAP financial measure and\nreconciliation table for adjusted expenses.\nNet investment income was $887,000, or $0.34 per share, compared with $799,000, or\n$0.31 per share, in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net investment income per\nshare, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the capital gains incentive fee\naccrual expense, was $0.46 per share, up 59% from $0.29 per share in last year’s third\nquarter. See the attached description of this non-GAAP financial measure and\nreconciliation table for adjusted net investment income per share.\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of September 30, 2024, Rand’s portfolio included investments with a fair value of $75.0\nmillion across 22 portfolio businesses. This was a decrease of $2.1 million, or 3%, from\nDecember 31, 2023, and reflected new and follow-on investments and valuation adjustments\nin multiple portfolio companies, offset by the SciAps exit, stock sales and other portfolio\ncompany loan repayments. At September 30, 2024, Rand’s portfolio was comprised of\napproximately 74% in debt investments and 26% in equity investments in private companies.\nThe annualized weighted average yield of debt investments, which includes PIK interest,\nwas 13.8% at September 30, 2024, compared with 13.6% at the end of 2023.\nThird quarter 2024:\nFunded a follow-on debt investment of $125,000 in ITA Acquisition, LLC. Rand’s total\ndebt and equity investment in ITA Acquisition, LLC had a fair value of $4.9 million at\nquarter-end.\nReceived $13.1 million from the previously announced sale of portfolio company\nSciAps, Inc., which included a realized gain of $7.7 million. The proceeds from the sale\npayable at closing to Rand consisted of $2.1 million in debt repayment, $165,000 in\ninterest income and loan-related fees, and $10.8 million in equity return. These totals\nreflect $244,000 held in transaction-related escrows.\nSold remaining shares in two publicly traded BDCs for total proceeds of $1.3 million,\nwhich netted a realized gain of $249,000.\nExited investment in Mezmeriz, realizing a tax loss on an equity investment having a\nfair value of zero.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash was $3.4 million at September 30, 2024. During the quarter, Rand utilized the\nproceeds from the portfolio company sale and cash on hand to reduce its outstanding\nborrowings by $13.3 million, leaving a principal balance of $3.9 million on its existing $25.0\nmillion senior secured revolving credit facility at September 30, 2024. The outstanding\nborrowings carried an interest rate of 8.46% at quarter-end.\nThe Company did not repurchase any outstanding common stock during the third quarter of\n2024.\nDividends\nOn July 31, 2024, Rand declared its regular quarterly cash dividend distribution of $0.29 per\nshare. The cash dividend was paid during the third quarter to shareholders of record as of\nAugust 30, 2024. Rand’s fourth quarter dividend announcement is expected in early\nDecember.\nWebcast and Conference Call\nRand will host a conference call and webcast on Wednesday November 6, 2024, at 1:30\np.m. Eastern Time, to review its financial results.

(“GAAP”) financial measure, Rand presents adjusted expenses, which is a non-\nGAAP financial measure. Adjusted expenses is defined as GAAP total expenses removing\nthe effect of any expenses/(credits) for capital gains incentive fees accrual.

Restricted securities are subject to one or more restrictions on resale and are not freely marketable. Type of investment for equity position is in the form of shares unless otherwise noted as units or interests, i.e., preferred shares, common shares.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Date Acquired column indicates the date on which the Corporation first acquired an investment.\n\n(c)\n\nEach equity percentage estimates the Corporation’s ownership interest in the applicable portfolio investment. The estimated ownership is calculated based on the percent of outstanding voting securities held by the Corporation or the potential percentage of voting securities held by the Corporation upon exercise of warrants or conversion of debentures, or other available data. If applicable, the symbol “<1%” indicates that the Corporation holds an equity interest of less than one percent.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Corporation’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value and establishes guidelines for measuring fair value. At September 30, 2024, ASC 820 designates 100% of the Corporation’s investments as “Level 3” assets. Under the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading day of the reporting period. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale and are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our external investment advisor Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”) and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is considered to be the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of any particular date, however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other dispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in determining the fair value of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the investment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have an impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 3. “Investments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n(e)\n\nThese investments are non-income producing. All other investments are income producing. Non-income producing investments have not generated cash payments of interest or dividends including LLC tax-related distributions within the last twelve months or are not expected to do so going forward. If a debt or a preferred equity investment fails to make its most recent payment, then the investment will also be classified as non-income producing.\n\n(f)\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the total cost of investment securities was approximately $67.1 million. Net unrealized appreciation was approximately $8.0 million, which was comprised of $12.1 million of unrealized appreciation of investment securities and ($4.2) million of unrealized depreciation of investment securities. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was $13.6 million and the aggregate gross unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was ($3.3) million. The net unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was $10.2 million based on a tax cost of $64.8 million.\n\n(g)\n\nAll of the Corporation’s portfolio assets are pledged as collateral for purposes of securing the Corporation’s senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a general security agreement, dated June 27, 2022, between the Corporation, the subsidiaries listed therein, and the Lender (as defined herein).\n\n(h)\n\nReduction in cost and fair value from previously reported balances reflects current principal repayment.\n\n(i)\n\nRepresents interest due (amounts over $100,000) from investments included as interest receivable on the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. None at September 30, 2024.\n\n(j)\n\nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\n\n(k)\n\nAffiliate Investments are defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), as those Non-Control investments in companies in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation.\n\n(l)\n\nPayment in kind (PIK) represents earned interest that is added to the cost basis of the investment and due at maturity. The amount of PIK earned is included in the interest rate detailed in the “Type of Investment” column, unless it has been noted with a (+), in which case the PIK is in addition to the face amount of interest due on the security.\n\n(m)\n\nEquity holdings are held in a wholly owned (100%) “blocker corporation” subsidiary of Rand Capital Corporation for federal income tax and Regulated Investment Company (RIC) compliance purposes.\n\n(n)\n\nIndicates assets that the Corporation believes do not represent “qualifying assets” under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets must represent at least 70% of the Corporation’s total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. The Corporation had no non-qualifying assets as of September 30, 2024.\n\n(o)\n\nControl Investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments in companies in which more than 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation or where greater than 50% of the board representation is maintained.\n\n(p)\n\nInvestments classified as Level 3 for purposes of the fair value determination by RCM and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n8\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS\n\nSeptember 30, 2024

Restricted securities are subject to one or more restrictions on resale and are not freely marketable. Type of investment for equity position is in the form of shares unless otherwise noted as units or interests, i.e., preferred shares, common shares.\n\n(b)\n\nThe Date Acquired column indicates the date on which the Corporation first acquired an investment.\n\n(c)\n\nEach equity percentage estimates the Corporation’s ownership interest in the applicable portfolio investment. The estimated ownership is calculated based on the percent of outstanding voting securities held by the Corporation or the potential percentage of voting securities held by the Corporation upon exercise of warrants or conversion of debentures, or other available data. If applicable, the symbol “<1%” indicates that the Corporation holds an equity interest of less than one percent.\n\n(d)\n\nThe Corporation’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value and establishes guidelines for measuring fair value. At December 31, 2023, ASC 820 designates 91% of the Corporation’s investments as “Level 3” assets. Under the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading day of the reporting period. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale and are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our external investment advisor Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”) and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is considered to be the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of any particular date, however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other dispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in determining the fair value of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the investment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have an impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 3. “Investments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n(e)\n\nThese investments are non-income producing. All other investments are income producing. Non-income producing investments have not generated cash payments of interest or dividends including LLC tax-related distributions within the last twelve months or are not expected to do so going forward. If a debt or a preferred equity investment fails to make its most recent payment, then the investment will also be classified as non-income producing.\n\n(f)\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total cost of investment securities was approximately $68.4 million. Net unrealized appreciation was approximately $8.8 million, which was comprised of $14.1 million of unrealized appreciation of investment securities and ($5.4) million of unrealized depreciation of investment securities. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was $14.1 million and the aggregate gross unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was ($4.2) million. The net unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was $9.9 million based on a tax cost of $68 million.\n\n(g)\n\nAll of the Corporation’s portfolio assets are pledged as collateral for purposes of securing the Corporation’s senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a general security agreement, dated June 27, 2022, between the Corporation, the subsidiaries listed therein, and the Lender (as defined herein).\n\n(h)\n\nReduction in cost and fair value from previously reported balances reflects current principal repayment.\n\n(i)\n\nRepresents interest due (amounts over $50,000) from investments included as interest receivable on the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\n(j)\n\nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments. \n\n(k)\n\nAffiliate Investments are defined by the 1940 Act, as those Non-Control investments in companies in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation.\n\n(l)\n\nPayment in kind (PIK) represents earned interest that is added to the cost basis of the investment and due at maturity. The amount of PIK earned is included in the interest rate detailed in the “Type of Investment” column, unless it has been noted with a (+), in which case the PIK is in addition to the face amount of interest due on the security.\n\n(m)\n\nEquity holdings are held in a wholly owned (100%) “blocker corporation” subsidiary of Rand Capital Corporation for federal income tax and Regulated Investment Company (RIC) compliance purposes.\n\n(n)\n\nIndicates assets that the Corporation believes do not represent “qualifying assets” under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets must represent at least 70% of the Corporation’s total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. Of the Corporation’s total assets, 5.38% were non-qualifying assets as of December 31, 2023.\n\n(o)\n\nControl Investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments in companies in which more than 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation or where greater than 50% of the board representation is maintained.\n\n(p)\n\nInvestments classified as Level 3 for purposes of the fair value determination by RCM and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n16\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nCONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF PORTFOLIO

ORGANIZATION\n\nRand Capital Corporation (“Rand”, “we”, “us” and “our”) was incorporated under the laws of New York in February 1969. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and operated as an internally managed, closed end, management investment company from that time until November 2019.\n\nIn November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the “Closing”) with East Asset Management (“East”). The transaction consisted of a $25 million investment in Rand by East, in the form of cash and contributed portfolio assets, in exchange for approximately 8.3 million shares of Rand common stock. East owns approximately 64% of Rand Capital’s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2024. Concurrent with the Closing, Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”), a registered investment adviser, was retained by Rand as its external investment adviser and administrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as our investment adviser and administrator are collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction”). The term of our investment advisory and management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) in October 2024 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. In addition, the term of the administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by the Board in October 2024 and is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025. The Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement can continue for successive annual periods after December 31, 2025 provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i)(A) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), of us, RCM or our respective affiliates. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an incentive fee, if specified benchmarks are met.\n\nIn connection with the Closing, we also entered into a shareholder agreement by and between Rand and East (the “Shareholder Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has the right to designate two or three persons, depending upon the size of the Board, for nomination for election to the Board. East has the right to designate (i) up to two persons if the size of the Board is composed of fewer than seven directors or (ii) up to three persons if the size of the Board is composed of seven or more directors. East’s right to designate persons for nomination for election to the Board under the Shareholder Agreement is the exclusive means by which East may designate or nominate persons for election to the Board. The Board currently consists of five directors, and Adam S. Gusky and Benjamin E. Godley are East's designees on the Board.\n\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements specified in the 1940 Act. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets” and provide managerial assistance to the portfolio companies in which we invest. See “Item 1. Business - Regulations, Business Development Company Regulations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nIn connection with the completion of the Transaction, we have shifted to an investment strategy focused on higher yielding debt investments and elected U.S. Federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (“RIC”).\n\nThe Board declared the following quarterly cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nQuarter | Dividend/ShareAmount | Record Date | Payment Date  \n---|---|---|---  \n1st | $ | 0.25 | March 13, 2024 | March 29, 2024  \n2nd | $ | 0.29 | May 31, 2024 | June 14, 2024  \n3rd | $ | 0.29 | August 30, 2024 | September 13, 2024  \n  \nIn order to continue to qualify as a RIC, Rand holds several of its equity investments in wholly-owned subsidiaries that facilitate a tax structure that is advantageous to the RIC election. Rand has the following wholly-owned blocker subsidiaries in place at September 30, 2024: Rand BMP Swanson Holdings Corp., Rand Carolina Skiff Holdings Corp., Rand DSD Holdings Corp., Rand Filterworks Holdings Corp., Rand FSS Holdings Corp., Rand INEA Holdings Corp., and Rand ITA Holdings Corp. (collectively the “Blocker Corps”). These subsidiaries are consolidated using United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for financial reporting purposes.\n\n20\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nOn October 7, 2020, Rand, RCM and certain of their affiliates received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) to permit Rand to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain affiliates, including other BDCs and registered investment companies managed by RCM and certain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with Rand’s investment objective, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). On March 29, 2021, the SEC granted Rand, Callodine Group, LLC (“Callodine”), which holds a controlling interest in RCM, and certain of their affiliates a new exemptive order (the “New Order”) that superseded the Order and permits Rand to co-invest with affiliates managed by RCM and Callodine. Callodine is a yield focused asset management platform. Pursuant to the New Order, Rand is generally permitted to co-invest with affiliates covered by the New Order if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Rand’s independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Rand and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of Rand or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of Rand’s shareholders and is consistent with Rand’s investment objective and strategies and (3) the investment by Rand’s affiliates would not disadvantage Rand, and Rand’s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which Rand’s affiliates are investing. In addition, on September 6, 2022, the SEC granted an amendment to the New Order to permit Rand to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds (as defined in the New Order) that do not hold any investments in such existing portfolio companies.\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements describe the operations of Rand and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Rand Capital Sub, LLC (\"Rand Sub\") and the Blocker Corps (collectively, the “Corporation”).\n\nOur corporate office is located in Buffalo, NY and our website address is www.randcapital.com. We make available on our website our annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with the SEC. Our shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “RAND.”\n\nNote 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of Presentation – It is our opinion that the accompanying consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with GAAP of the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and statement of changes in net assets for the interim periods presented. The Corporation is an investment company following accounting and reporting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 946, Financial Services—Investment Companies. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted; however, we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information presented herein not misleading. The interim results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.\n\nThese statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Information contained in this filing should also be reviewed in conjunction with our related filings with the SEC prior to the date of this report.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rand and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statement of financial position of cash, interest receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term nature of these financial instruments.\n\nInvestment Classification – In accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Corporation classifies its investments by level of control. Under the 1940 Act, “Control Investments” are investments in companies that the Corporation is deemed to “Control” because it owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the company or has greater than 50% representation on the company’s board. “Affiliate Investments” are companies in which the Corporation owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities. “Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments” are those companies that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\n\nInvestments - Investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by RCM and approved by the Board. The Corporation generally invests in loan, debt, and equity instruments and there is no single standard for determining fair value of these investments. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio company while employing a consistent valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments, there may be material risks associated with this determination including that estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events. The Corporation analyzes and values\n\n21\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\neach investment quarterly and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become impaired, including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful. Conversely, the Corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that an underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and, therefore, the Corporation's equity securities in the underlying portfolio company have also appreciated in value. Additionally, the Corporation continues to assess any material risks associated with this fair value determination, including risks associated with material conflicts of interest. Under the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading day of the reporting period.\n\nQualifying Assets - As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation’s portfolio of investments only includes qualifying assets as defined in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. The Corporation’s qualifying assets consist of qualifying investments in privately held businesses, principally based in the United States.\n\nRevenue Recognition -Interest Income - Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt. In such cases, interest is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate. There was no reserve for possible losses of interest receivable as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Corporation holds debt securities in its investment portfolio that contain payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest provisions. PIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.\n\nRevenue Recognition - Dividend Income – The Corporation may receive cash distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies or corporations, and these distributions are classified as dividend income on the consolidated statement of operations. Dividend income is recognized on an accrual basis when it can be reasonably estimated for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\n\nThe Corporation may hold preferred equity securities that contain cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are recorded as dividend income, if declared and deemed collectible, and any dividends in arrears are recognized into income and added to the balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred equity is redeemed.\n\nRevenue Recognition - Fee Income - Consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the portfolio companies upon successful closing of financings, income associated with portfolio company monitoring fees and income associated with portfolio company loan modification fees.\n\nRealized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Investments - Amounts reported as realized gains and losses are measured by the difference between the proceeds from the sale or exchange and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses recorded in prior periods. The cost of securities that have, in management’s judgment, become worthless are written off and reported as realized losses when appropriate. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the difference between the fair value of the investments and the cost basis of the investments.\n\nOriginal Issue Discount – Investments may include “original issue discount”, or OID. This occurs when the Corporation purchases a warrant and a note from a portfolio company simultaneously, which requires an allocation of a portion of the purchase price to the warrant and reduces the purchase price allocated to the note by an equal amount in the form of a note discount or OID. The note is reported net of the OID and the OID is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.\n\nNet Assets per Share - Net assets per share are based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding. There are no common stock equivalents outstanding.\n\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information - Income taxes paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were $152,374 and $509,063, respectively. Interest paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,090,775 and $614,640, respectively. The Corporation converted $1,338,517 and $813,599 of interest receivable into investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nAccounting Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n22\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nStockholders’ Equity (Net Assets) - At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were 500,000 shares of $10.00 par value preferred stock authorized and unissued.\n\nOn May 7, 2024, the Board approved a share repurchase plan which authorizes the Corporation to repurchase shares of Rand’s outstanding common stock with an aggregate cost of up to $1,500,000 at prices per share of common stock no greater than the then current net asset value. This share repurchase authorization is in effect through May 7, 2025, and replaces the share repurchase authorization that was previously approved by the Board in April 2023. No shares of Rand's common stock were repurchased by the Corporation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nIncome Taxes – The Corporation elected to be treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. The Corporation must distribute substantially all of its investment company taxable income each tax year as dividends to its shareholders to maintain its RIC status. If the Corporation continues to qualify as a RIC and continues to satisfy the annual distribution requirement, the Corporation will not have to pay corporate level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that the Corporation distributes to its stockholders.\n\nThe Blocker Corps, which are consolidated under U.S. GAAP for financial reporting purposes, are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Therefore, the Corporation accounts for income taxes pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under FASB ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The Corporation records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if and to the extent it is more likely than not that the Corporation will not recover the deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Corporation weights all relevant positive and negative evidence, and considers among other factors, historical financial performance, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, and tax planning strategies. Changes in circumstances, including the Blocker Corps generating significant taxable income and tax planning strategies, could cause a change in judgment about the need for a valuation allowance of the related deferred tax assets. Any change in the valuation allowance will be included in income in the period of the change in estimate.\n\nAccordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the valuation allowance against the Corporation's U.S. federal deferred tax assets was $131,338.\n\nThe Corporation reviews the tax positions it has taken to determine if they meet a \"more likely than not threshold\" for the benefit of the tax position to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. A tax position that fails to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold will result in either a reduction of a current or deferred tax asset or receivable, or the recording of a current or deferred tax liability. There were no uncertain tax positions recorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Corporation may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Corporation determines that its estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated dividend distributions for the current year from such income, the Corporation accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as such taxable income is earned. The Corporation did not incur any federal excise tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Corporation incurred $24,543 in federal excise tax expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nDistributions from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and those differences could be material. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. Reclassifications due to permanent book-tax differences, including the offset of net operating losses against short-term gains and nondeductible meals and entertainment, have no impact on net assets.\n\nThe Corporation is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023. In general, the Corporation’s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023.\n\nIt is the Corporation’s policy to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Corporation incurred $720 in interest expense related to income tax liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no amounts recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n23\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nConcentration of Credit and Market Risk – The Corporation’s financial instruments potentially subject it to concentrations of credit risk. Cash is invested with banks in amounts which, at times, exceed insured limits. The Corporation does not anticipate non-performance by such banks.\n\nThe following are the concentrations of the top five portfolio company values compared to the fair value of the Corporation’s total investment portfolio:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024  \n---  \nTilson Technology Management, Inc.

ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation is currently evaluating the potential effect the new standard will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n\nNote 3. INVESTMENTS\n\nThe Corporation’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\n\nLoan investments are defined as traditional loan financings typically with no equity features or required equity co-investment. Debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights, stock purchase warrants, and/or stock purchase options. Equity investments are direct investments into a portfolio company and may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\n\nThe Corporation uses several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment. The main approaches are:\n\n•\n\nLoan and debt securities are generally valued at cost when representative of the fair value of the investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds are expected to exist from a sale of a portfolio company at its estimated fair value. The valuation may also consider the carrying interest rate versus the related inherent portfolio risk of the investment. A loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality, collection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist.\n\n•\n\nEquity securities may be valued using the:\n\n▪\n\nCost approach - The cost approach uses estimates of the liquidation value of the portfolio companies’ assets in relation to the cost of the respective security. This approach values the equity at the value remaining after the portfolio company pays off its debt and loan balances and its outstanding liabilities.\n\n▪\n\nMarket approach - The market approach uses observable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions. It may include both private and public M&A transactions where the traded price is a multiple of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) or another relevant operating metric. It may also include the market value of comparable public companies that are trading in an active market, or the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the investment. Additionally, the Corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor.\n\n24\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\n▪\n\nIncome approach - The income approach employs valuation techniques to convert future benefits or costs, usually in the form of cash flows, into a present value amount. The measurement is based on value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\n\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, used in the Corporation’s valuation at the measurement date. Under the valuation policy, the Corporation values unrestricted publicly traded companies, categorized as Level 1 investments, at the closing price on the last trading day of the reporting period.\n\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\n\nLevel 3: Unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value.\n\nFinancial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, all of the Corporation’s investments were Level 3 investments. At December 31, 2023, 9% of the Corporation’s investments were Level 1 investments and 91% were Level 3 investments. There were no Level 2 investments at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\n\nIn the valuation process, the Corporation values restricted securities categorized as Level 3 investments, using information from these portfolio companies, which may include:\n\n•\n\nAudited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets;\n\n•\n\nCurrent and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company;\n\n•\n\nCurrent and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations;\n\n•\n\nThe current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event were to occur;\n\n•\n\nPending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company;\n\n•\n\nCurrent information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent financing transactions;\n\n•\n\nCurrent ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed;\n\n•\n\nChanges in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company;\n\n•\n\nQualitative assessment of key management; and\n\n•\n\nOther factors deemed relevant to assess valuation.\n\nThe valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company’s performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the factors that led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted.\n\nEquity Securities\n\nEquity securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s equity investments are EBITDA and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the debt and senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard industry multiples may be used when available; however, the Corporation’s portfolio companies are typically privately-held, lower middle market companies and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational characteristics of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\n\nAnother key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction entered into by the portfolio company with a sophisticated, non-strategic, unrelated, new investor. The terms of these equity transactions may not be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the Corporation, and the impact of the difference in transaction terms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\n\n25\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nWhen appropriate the Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes. This model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the valuation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\n\nFor investments made within the last year, the Corporation generally relies on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless other fair value inputs are identified causing the Corporation to depart from this basis.\n\nLoan and Debt Securities\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s loan and debt securities are the financial and operational performance of the portfolio company, similar debt with similar terms with other portfolio companies, as well as the market acceptance for the portfolio company’s products or services. These inputs will likely provide an indicator as to the probability of principal recovery of the investment. The Corporation’s loan and debt investments are often junior secured or unsecured securities. Fair value may also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a change in fair value. For recent investments, the Corporation generally relies on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless other fair value inputs are identified causing the Corporation to depart from this basis.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the Corporation’s Level 3 portfolio investments as of September 30, 2024:\n\nInvestment Type | Market Approach EBITDA Multiple | Market Approach Liquidation Seniority | Market ApproachRevenue Multiple | Market Approach Transaction Pricing | Totals  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Equity | $ | 72,522 | $ | — | $ | 700,000 | $ | 100,063 | $ | 872,585  \nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Loan and Debt | 10,957,828 | 4,476,604 | — | 2,949,000 | 18,383,432  \nTotal Non-Control/Non-Affiliate | $ | 11,030,350 | $ | 4,476,604 | $ | 700,000 | $ | 3,049,063 | $ | 19,256,017  \nAffiliate Equity | $ | 18,272,384 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 18,272,384  \nAffiliate Loan and Debt | 30,837,197 | — | — | 1,750,000 | 32,587,197  \nTotal Affiliate | $ | 49,109,581 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 1,750,000 | $ | 50,859,581  \nControl Equity | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | — | $ | —  \nControl Loan and Debt | — | 4,919,969 | — | — | 4,919,969  \nTotal Control | $ | — | $ | 4,919,969 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 4,919,969  \nTotal Level 3 Investments | $ | 60,139,931 | $ | 9,396,573 | $ | 700,000 | $ | 4,799,063 | $ | 75,035,567  \nRange | 5X - 12.3X | 1X | 3.5X | Not Applicable  \nUnobservable Input | EBITDA Multiple | Asset Value | Revenue Multiple | Transaction Price  \nWeighted Average | 6.9X | 1X | 3.5X | Not Applicable  \n  \nThe following table provides a summary of the components of Level 1, 2 and 3 Assets Measured at Fair Value at September 30, 2024:\n\nFair Value Measurements at Reported Date Using  \n---  \nDescription | September 30, 2024 | Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets(Level 1) | SignificantObservable Inputs(Level 2) | Other SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)  \nLoan investments | $ | 17,301,482 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 17,301,482  \nDebt investments | 38,589,116 | — | — | 38,589,116  \nEquity investments | 19,144,969 | — | — | 19,144,969  \nTotal | $ | 75,035,567 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 75,035,567  \n  \n26\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of Level 1, 2 and 3 Assets Measured at Fair Value at December 31, 2023:\n\nFair Value Measurements at Reported Date Using  \n---  \nDescription | December 31, 2023 | Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets(Level 1) | SignificantObservable Inputs(Level 2) | Other SignificantUnobservableInputs(Level 3)  \nLoan investments | $ | 12,417,977 | $ | — | $ | — | $ | 12,417,977  \nDebt investments | 36,861,525 | — | — | 36,861,525  \nEquity investments | 27,846,210 | 7,309,650 | — | 20,536,560  \nTotal | $ | 77,125,712 | $ | 7,309,650 | $ | — | $ | 69,816,062  \n  \n27\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in Assets Measured at Fair Value Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  \n---  \nDescription | Loan Investments | DebtInvestments | EquityInvestments | Total  \nEnding balance December 31, 2023, of Level 3 Assets | $ | 12,417,977 | $ | 36,861,525 | $ | 20,536,560 | $ | 69,816,062  \nRealized gains (losses) included in net change in net assetsfrom operations:  \nDSD Operating, LLC (DSD) | — | — | 23,699 | 23,699  \nKnoa Software, Inc.

SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\n\nOn June 27, 2022, the Corporation entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with M&T Bank, as lender (the “Lender”), which provides the Corporation with a senior secured revolving credit facility in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0 million (the “Credit Facility”). The amount the Corporation can borrow, at any given time, under the Credit Facility is tied to a borrowing base, which is measured as (i) 75% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of the publicly traded equity securities held (other than shares of ACV Auctions, if any) plus (ii) the least of (a) 75% of the fair market value of the shares of ACV Auctions held, if any, (b) $6.25 million and (c) 25% of the aggregate borrowing base availability for the Credit Facility at any date of determination plus (iii) 50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of eligible private loans held that meet specified criteria plus (iv) the lesser of (a) 50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of unsecured private loans held that meet specified criteria and (b) $1.25 million minus (v) such reserves as the Lender may establish from time to time in its sole discretion. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of June 27, 2027. Under the borrowing base formula described above, the unused line of credit balance for the Credit Facility was $21,100,000 at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe Corporation’s borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) or (ii) 0.25%. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation's applicable interest rate was 8.46%. In addition, under the terms of the Credit Facility, the Corporation has also agreed to pay the Lender an unused commitment fee on a quarterly basis, computed as 0.30% multiplied by the average daily Unused Commitment Fee Base (which is defined as the difference between (i) $25.0 million and (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Corporation’s outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility) for the preceding quarter.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants usual and customary for agreements of this type, including among others, covenants that prohibit, subject to certain specified exceptions, the Corporation’s ability to merge or consolidate with other companies, sell any material part of the Corporation’s assets, incur other indebtedness, incur liens on the Corporation’s assets, make investments or loans to third parties other than permitted investments and permitted loans, and declare any distribution or dividend other than certain permitted distributions. The Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: (i) a tangible net worth covenant that requires the Corporation to maintain a Tangible Net Worth (defined in the Credit Agreement as the Corporation’s aggregate assets, excluding intangible assets, less all liabilities) of not less than $50.0 million, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter, (ii) an asset coverage ratio covenant that requires the Corporation to maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of the fair market value of all of the Corporation’s assets to the sum of all of the Corporation’s obligations for borrowed money plus all capital lease obligations) of not less than 3:1, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter and (iii) an interest coverage ratio covenant that requires the Corporation to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) of not less than 2.5:1, which is measured quarterly on a trailing twelve-months basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Corporation was in compliance with these covenants.\n\nEvents of default under the Credit Agreement which permit the Lender to exercise its remedies, including acceleration of the principal and interest on the Credit Facility, include, among others: (i) default in the payment of principal or interest on the Credit Facility, (ii) default by the Corporation on any other obligation, condition, covenant or other provision under the Credit Agreement and related documents, (iii) failure by the Corporation to pay any material indebtedness or obligation owing to any third party or affiliate, or the failure by the Corporation to perform any agreement with any third party or affiliate that would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, (iv) the sale of all or substantially all of the Corporation’s assets to a third party, (v) various bankruptcy and insolvency events, and (vi) any material adverse change in the Corporation and its subsidiaries,\n\n30\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\ntaken as a whole, or their business, assets, operations, management, ownership, affairs, condition (financial or otherwise) or the Lender’s collateral that the Lender reasonably determines will have a material adverse effect on the Lender’s collateral, the Corporation and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or their business, assets, operation or condition (financial or otherwise) or on the Corporation’s ability to repay its debts.\n\nIn connection with entry into the Credit Facility, the Corporation and each of its subsidiaries that guaranty the Credit Facility entered into a general security agreement, dated June 27, 2022, with the Lender (the “Security Agreement”). The Security Agreement secures all of the Corporation’s obligations to the Lender, including, without limitation, principal and interest on the Credit Facility and any fees and charges. The security interest granted under the Security Agreement covers all of the Corporation’s personal property including, among other things, all accounts, chattel paper, investment property, deposit accounts, general intangibles, inventory, and all of the fixtures. The Security Agreement contains various representations, warranties, covenants and agreements customary in security agreements and various events of default with remedies under the New York Uniform Commercial Code and the Security Agreement. Events of default under the Security Agreement, which permit the Lender to exercise its various remedies, are similar to those contained in the Credit Agreement.\n\nThe outstanding balance drawn on the Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $3,900,000 and $16,250,000, respectively. The unamortized closing fee was $68,750 and $87,500 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and it is recorded in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Amortization expense related to the Credit Facility during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6,250 and $18,750, respectively. Amortization expense related to the Credit Facility during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $6,250 and $18,750, respectively.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the average debt outstanding under the Credit Facility and weighted average interest rate were as follows:\n\nThree months endedSeptember 30, 2024 | Three months endedSeptember 30, 2023 | Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2024 | Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2023  \n---|---|---|---  \nAverage debt outstanding | $ | 10,026,087 | $ | 12,161,957 | $ | 14,746,168 | $ | 10,086,630  \nWeighted average interest rate | 8.99 | % | 8.95 | % | 8.93 | % | 8.68 | %  \n  \nNote 7.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\n\nInvestment Management Agreement\n\nIn November 2019, the Corporation completed a stock sale transaction with East Asset Management. Concurrent with the Closing, RCM, a registered investment adviser, was retained by Rand as its external investment adviser and administrator, which resulted in Daniel Penberthy, the Corporation's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Margaret Brechtel, the Corporation's Executive Vice President, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, serving as officers and employees of RCM. Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Corporation pays RCM, as compensation for the investment advisory and management services, fees consisting of two components: (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive Fee.\n\nAt September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts payable to RCM were comprised of the following, and are reported on the \"Due to investment adviser\" line on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nBase Management Fee payable | $ | 309,265 | $ | 287,297  \nIncome Based Incentive Fees payable | 178,218 | —  \nCapital Gains Fee payable | — | 692,000  \nTotal due to investment adviser | $ | 487,483 | $ | 979,297  \n  \nThe “Base Management Fee” is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the Corporation’s total assets (other than cash but including assets purchased with borrowed funds). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Base Management Fee was $309,265 and $934,532, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Base Management Fee was $268,609 and $769,869, respectively.\n\nThe “Incentive Fee” is comprised of two parts: (1) the “Income Based Fee” and (2) the “Capital Gains Fee”. The Income Based Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” (as defined in the Investment Management Agreement) for the immediately preceding calendar quarter, subject to a hurdle rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized) and is payable promptly following the filing of the Corporation’s financial statements for such quarter, to the extent the Income Based Fee exceeds Accrued Unpaid Income.\n\nThe Corporation pays RCM an Incentive Fee with respect to its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows:\n\n(i)\n\nno Income Based Fee in any quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter does not exceed the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized);\n\n(ii)\n\n100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized) but is less than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized); and\n\n(iii)\n\n20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% (8.75% annualized).\n\n32\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nThe Income Based Fee paid to RCM for any calendar quarter shall not be in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap. The “Incentive Fee Cap” for any quarter is an amount equal to (1) 20.0% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period (as defined below) minus (2) the aggregate Income Based Fee that was paid in respect of the calendar quarters included in the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period.\n\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Income Based Fee Calculation Period” is defined as, with reference to a calendar quarter, the period of time consisting of such calendar quarter and the additional quarters that comprise the eleven calendar quarters immediately preceding such calendar quarter.\n\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Cumulative Net Return” is defined as (1) the aggregate net investment income in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period minus (2) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Corporation pays no Income Based Fee to RCM for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the Income Based Fee that is payable to RCM for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Corporation pays an Income Based Fee to RCM equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Income Based Fee that is payable to RCM for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Corporation pays an Income Based Fee to the Adviser equal to the Income Based Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.\n\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Net Capital Loss,” in respect of a particular period, means the difference, if positive, between (1) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (2) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period. \n\nAny Income Based Fee otherwise payable under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income (as described below) (such fees being the “Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees”) shall be deferred, on a security by security basis, and shall become payable to RCM only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received in respect of any Accrued Unpaid Income. Any Accrued Unpaid Income that is subsequently reversed in connection with a write-down, write-off, impairment or similar treatment of the investment giving rise to such Accrued Unpaid Income will, in the applicable period of reversal, (1) reduce Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and (2) reduce the amount of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees. For purposes of the Investment Management Agreement, Accrued Unpaid Income is defined as any net investment income that consists of any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment-in-kind interest, payment-in-kind dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that the Corporation has recognized in accordance with GAAP, but has not yet received in cash. Subsequent payments of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees that are deferred as provided for in the Investment Management Agreement shall not reduce the amounts otherwise payable for any quarter as an Income Based Fee.\n\nFor the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Income Based Fees earned were $178,218. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no Income Based Fees earned under the Investment Management Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, cumulative accrued Income Based Fees payable were $178,218, and after calculating Accrued Unpaid Income, none was immediately payable. As of December 31, 2023, there were there were no accrued Income Based Fees payable.\n\nThe second part of the Incentive Fee is the “Capital Gains Fee”. This fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (2) the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from November 8, 2019. If this amount is positive at the end of any calendar year, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee payable for that calendar year. If the Investment Management Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains Fee.\n\nFor purposes of the Capital Gains Fee:\n\n•\n\nThe cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Corporations portfolio when sold minus (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\n\n•\n\nThe cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\n\n33\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\n•\n\nThe aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the amount, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date minus (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\n\nFor purposes of calculating the amount of the capital gains incentive fee accrual to be included as part of a company’s financial statements, GAAP requires a company to consider, as part of such calculation, the amount of cumulative aggregate unrealized capital appreciation that such company has with respect to its investments. As a result, the capital gains incentive fee accrual under GAAP is calculated using the both the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and losses and the aggregate net change in unrealized capital appreciation/depreciation at the close of the period. If the calculated amount is positive, GAAP requires the Corporation to record a capital gains incentive fee accrual equal to 20% of this cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of actual capital gains incentive fees paid, or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP, for all prior periods. However, unrealized capital appreciation is not used by the Corporation as part of the calculation to determine the amount of the Capital Gains Fee actually payable to RCM under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement. There can be no assurances that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was no Capital Gains Fee currently payable under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, and the final calculations are determined annually, and subject to change based on subsequent realized gains, losses or unrealized losses during the remainder of 2024.\n\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Corporation is required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee on all realized and unrealized gains and losses, resulting in an accrual of $4,346,000 at September 30, 2024, which represents the fee that would be due based on net portfolio appreciation. The $4,346,000 accrued capital gains incentive fee is recorded in the line item “Capital gains incentive fees” on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at September 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, there was an accrual of $2,971,700 for the capital gains incentive fee, which represented both the capital gains fee payable to RCM of $692,000 and $2,279,700 that would be due based on net portfolio appreciation at December 31, 2023. The $692,000 capital gains fee payable was recorded in the line item \"Due to investment adviser\" on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at December 31, 2023, and was paid to RCM during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the capital gains incentive fee expense was $313,000 and $2,066,300, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the capital gains incentive fee expense was ($41,300) and $740,700, respectively.\n\nAdministration Agreement\n\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, RCM agreed to perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of) the administrative services necessary for the Corporation’s operations, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as RCM, subject to review by the Board, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations under the Administration Agreement. RCM shall also arrange for the services of, and oversee, custodians, depositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other shareholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters, brokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary or desirable.\n\nRCM is responsible for the Corporation’s financial and other records that are required to be maintained and prepares all reports and other materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority, including reports to shareholders. In addition, RCM assists the Corporation in determining and publishing the Corporation’s net asset value (NAV), overseeing the preparation and filing of the tax returns, and the printing and dissemination of reports to shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered by others. RCM provides, on the Corporation’s behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that have accepted its offer to provide such assistance.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Corporation recorded administrative fees of $118,167 and $111,750, respectively, related to costs incurred by RCM that are reimbursable under the Administration Agreement.\n\n34\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nNote 9.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods.\n\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nStatements included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Additional oral or written forward-looking statements may be made by us from time to time, and forward-looking statements may be included in documents that are filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements may include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions, including statements related to our investment strategies and our intention to co-invest with certain of our affiliates; the impact of our election as a RIC for U.S. federal tax purposes on the payment of corporate level U.S. federal income taxes by Rand; statements regarding our liquidity and financial resources; statements regarding any capital gains fee that may be due to RCM upon a hypothetical liquidation of our portfolio and the amount of the capital gains fee that may be payable to RCM for 2024; and statements regarding our compliance with the RIC requirements as of September 30, 2024; and statements regarding future dividend payments, and are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “believes,” “forecasts,” “intends,” “possible,” “expects,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or “plans” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions concerning the state of the United States economy and the local markets in which our portfolio companies operate, the state of the securities markets in which the securities of our portfolio companies could be traded, liquidity within the United States financial markets, and inflation. Forward-looking statements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” contained in Part II, Item 1A of this report and in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThere may be other factors not identified that affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date when it is made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them.\n\nOverview\n\nWe are an externally managed non-diversified investment company that lends to and invests in lower middle market companies. Our investment objective is to generate current income and when possible, complement this current income with capital appreciation. As a result, our investments are primarily in higher yielding debt instruments. Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”).\n\nWe have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements specified in the 1940 Act.\n\nIn November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the “Closing”) with East Asset Management (“East”). The transaction consisted of a $25 million investment in Rand by East, in the form of cash and contributed portfolio assets, in exchange for approximately 8.3 million shares of Rand common stock. East owns approximately 64% of Rand Capital’s outstanding common stock at September 30, 2024. Concurrent with the Closing, Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”), a registered investment adviser, was retained by Rand as its external investment adviser and administrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as our investment adviser and administrator are collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction”). The term of the new investment advisory and management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) in October 2024 and will expire on December 31, 2025. In addition, the term of the administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by the Board in October 2024 and will expire on December 31, 2025. The Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement can continue for successive annual periods after December 31, 2025 provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i)(A) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the\n\n36\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\naffirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), of us, RCM or our respective affiliates.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an incentive fee, comprised of two parts: (1) the \"Income Based Fee\" and (2) the \"Capital Gains Fee\", if specified benchmarks are met.\n\nWe elected U.S federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. In addition, as a RIC, we must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90% of our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any. Accordingly, our Board has regularly declared a quarterly cash dividend since our RIC election.\n\nOur Board declared the following quarterly cash dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\n\nQuarter | Dividend/ShareAmount | Record Date | Payment Date  \n---|---|---|---  \n1st | $ | 0.25 | March 13, 2024 | March 29, 2024  \n2nd | $ | 0.29 | May 31, 2024 | June 14, 2024  \n3rd | $ | 0.29 | August 30, 2024 | September 13, 2024  \n  \nWe may co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive relief order we received from the SEC, with certain of our affiliates. See “SEC Exemptive Order” below.We believe these types of co-investments may afford us additional investment opportunities and provide an ability to achieve greater diversification in our investment portfolio.\n\nSEC Exemptive Order\n\nOn October 7, 2020, Rand, RCM and certain of their affiliates received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit the Corporation to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain affiliates, including other BDCs and registered investment companies managed by RCM and certain of its affiliates, in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). On March 29, 2021, the SEC granted Rand, RCM, Callodine, which holds a controlling interest in RCM, and certain of their affiliates a new exemptive order (the “New Order”) that superseded the Order and permits Rand to co-invest with affiliates managed by RCM and Callodine. Pursuant to the New Order, we are generally permitted to co-invest with affiliates covered by the New Order if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Rand’s independent directors makes certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Rand and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of Rand or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Rand’s shareholders and is consistent with Rand’s investment objective and strategies and (3) the investment by Rand’s affiliates would not disadvantage Rand, and Rand’s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which Rand’s affiliates are investing. In addition, on September 6, 2022, the SEC granted an amendment to the New Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds (as defined in the New Order) that do not hold any investments in such existing portfolio companies.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. A summary of our critical accounting policies can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n\n37\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nFinancial Condition\n\nOverview:\n\nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | (Decrease) Increase | % (Decrease) Increase  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal assets | $ | 79,798,119 | $ | 81,021,982 | $ | (1,223,863 | ) | (1.5 | )%  \nTotal liabilities | 9,351,483 | 20,206,769 | (10,855,286 | ) | (53.7 | )%  \nNet assets | $ | 70,446,636 | $ | 60,815,213 | $ | 9,631,423 | 15.8 | %  \n  \nNet asset value per share (NAV) was $27.29 at September 30, 2024 and $23.56 at December 31, 2023.\n\nCash approximated 4.8% of net assets at September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.4% of net assets at December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring 2022, we entered into a $25 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with M&T Bank, as lender (the “Lender”), with the amount that we can borrow thereunder, at any given time, determined based upon a borrowing base formula. The Credit Facility has a 5-year term with a maturity date of June 27, 2027. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) or (ii) 0.25%. At September 30, 2024, there was $3,900,000 drawn on the Credit Facility and the applicable interest rate was 8.46%. See “Note 6. Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our Credit Facility.\n\nComposition of Our Investment Portfolio\n\nOur financial condition is dependent on the success of our portfolio holdings.

As a result, we are focused on investing in higher yielding debt instruments and related equity investments in privately held, lower middle market companies with a committed and experienced management team in a broad variety of industries. In the past, we have also invested in publicly traded shares of other business development companies that provide income through dividends and have more liquidity than our private company equity investments.\n\n38\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nThe change in investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, at cost, is comprised of the following:\n\nCostIncrease (Decrease)  \n---  \nNew investments:  \nMattison Avenue Holdings, LLC (Mattison) | $ | 5,500,000  \nMountain Regional Equipment Solutions (MRES) | 3,204,545  \nSeybert’s Billiards Corporation (Seybert's) | 1,800,000  \nITA Acquisition, LLC (ITA) | 458,333  \nBMP Food Service Supply Holdco, LLC (FSS) | 107,619  \nTotal of new investments | 11,070,497  \nOther changes to investments:  \nCaitec, Inc.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, total investment income was received from 23 portfolio companies.\n\nInterest from portfolio companies – Interest from portfolio companies was approximately 27% higher during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 due to the fact that we originated additional interest yielding investments during the last year. The new debt instruments were originated from FSS, ITA, Mattison, MRES, and Seybert's.\n\nInterest from other investments - The decrease in interest from other investments is primarily due to lower average idle cash balances during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023.\n\nDividend and other investment income - Dividend income is comprised of cash distributions from limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations in which we have invested. Our investment agreements with certain LLCs require those LLCs to distribute funds to us for payment of income taxes on our allocable share of the LLC’s profits. These portfolio companies may also elect to make additional discretionary distributions or dividends. Dividend income will fluctuate based upon the profitability of these LLCs and corporations and the timing of the distributions. The dividend distributions for the respective periods were:\n\nThree months endedSeptember 30, 2024 | Three months endedSeptember 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nFS KKR | $ | 33,600 | $ | 36,000  \nTilson Technology Management Inc.

The financing fees are amortized ratably over the life of the instrument associated with the fees. The unamortized fees are carried on the balance sheet under the line item “Deferred revenue.”\n\nThe income associated with the amortization of financing fees was $52,803 and $38,565 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a prepayment fee of $146,300 from our debt investment in SciAps, a loan modification fee of $4,929 from our debt investment in SciAps, and a monitoring fee of $11,589 from our investment in First Coast Mulch. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a monitoring fee of $12,000 from our investment in First Coast Mulch.\n\nExpenses\n\nThree months endedSeptember 30, 2024 | Three months endedSeptember 30, 2023 | Increase | % Increase  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal expenses | $ | 1,333,930 | $ | 809,936 | $ | 523,994 | 64.7 | %  \n  \nThe increase in total expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same period in 2023 was primarily due to a $354,300 increase in the capital gains incentive fee expense and a $178,218 increase in the income based incentive fee expense.\n\nThe capital gains incentive fee accrual expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to the calculation of the capital gains fee as required by GAAP. We are required under GAAP to accrue capital gains incentive fees on the basis of net realized capital gains and losses and net unrealized gains and losses. Our capital gains incentive fee accrual reflects the capital gains incentive fees that would be payable to RCM if our entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet date, even though RCM is not entitled to this capital gains incentive fee under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to unrealized gains unless and until such gains are realized. The increase in expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024 can be attributed to realized capital gains during the quarter.\n\nThe income based incentive fee is calculated quarterly in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement. The income based incentive fee accrued during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $178,218, and is due to an increase in\n\n40\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income above the hurdle rate as set forth and described in the Investment Management Agreement. “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\" means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during such calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for such calendar quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding any portion of the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment-in-kind interest, payment-in-kind dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities, that we have recognized in accordance with GAAP, but have not yet received in cash (collectively, “Accrued Unpaid Income”). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized and unrealized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The income based incentive fee with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income shall be deferred, on a security by security basis, and shall become payable only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received. The Accrued Unpaid Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 exceeded the income based incentive fee for the third quarter of 2024, and therefore, no income based incentive fee is currently payable to RCM at September 30, 2024.\n\nNet Investment Income\n\nThe excess of investment income over total expenses, including income taxes, represents net investment income. The net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $887,035 and $798,583, respectively.\n\nRealized Gain (Loss) on Investments\n\nThree months endedSeptember 30, 2024 | Three months endedSeptember 30, 2023 | Change  \n---|---|---  \nRealized gain (loss) on investments before income taxes | $ | 7,230,082 | $ | (2,802,731 | ) | $ | 10,032,813  \n  \nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold our investment in SciAps and recognized a realized gain of $7,699,879. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we liquidated our investment in Mezmeriz, which was previously valued at $0, and recognized a realized loss of ($742,850). We also recognized a realized gain of $23,699 from additional proceeds received from DSD Operating, LLC (DSD), an investment we exited during 2023.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net realized gain of $190,072 on the sale of 48,000 shares of FS KKR and a net realized gain of $59,282 on the sale of 40,000 shares of Barings.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, we liquidated our investment in Rheonix, Inc.

The principal measure of our financial performance is \"Net increase in net assets from operations\" on our consolidated statements of operations.

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized and unrealized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. The income based incentive fee with respect to Accrued Unpaid Income shall be deferred, on a security by security basis, and shall become payable only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received. The Accrued Unpaid Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 exceeded the income based incentive fee for the third quarter of 2024, and therefore, no income based incentive fee is currently payable to RCM at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe base management fee payable to RCM is calculated based upon total assets less cash, and, as we deploy more capital into investments, the base management fee payable to RCM will increase accordingly. The base management fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $934,532 and $769,869, respectively.\n\nProfessional fees expense increased by $44,825 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus the same period in 2023, as we incurred increased fees associated with the complex regulatory environment in which we operate.\n\n44\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nNet Investment Income\n\nThe excess of investment income over total expenses, including income taxes, represents net investment income. The net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $1,209,425 and $2,006,129, respectively.\n\nRealized Gain on Investments\n\nNine months endedSeptember 30, 2024 | Nine months endedSeptember 30, 2023 | Change  \n---|---|---  \nRealized gain on investments before income taxes | $ | 11,108,282 | $ | 1,068,904 | $ | 10,039,378  \n  \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold our investment in SciAps and recognized a realized gain of $7,699,879.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net realized gain of $3,450,092 on the sale of 194,934 shares of ACV, a net realized gain of $598,371 on the sale of 86,000 shares of Carlyle, a net realized gain of $484,834 on the sale of 195,000 shares of Pennantpark, a net realized gain of $190,072 on the sale of 48,000 shares of FS KKR, a net realized gain of $176,794 on the sale of 21,000 shares of Ares, and a net realized gain of $59,282 on the sale of 40,000 shares of Barings.

The principal measure of our financial performance is \"Net increase in net assets from operations\" on our consolidated statements of operations. The net increase in net assets from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $11,773,670 and $5,437,671, respectively.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet anticipated cash requirements, fund new and follow-on portfolio investments, pay distributions to our shareholders and respond to other general business demands. As of September 30, 2024, our total liquidity consisted of approximately $3,353,000 in cash and $21,100,000 of remaining availability on our Credit Facility.\n\nDuring 2022, we entered into a $25 million Credit Facility. The amount we can borrow, at any given time, under the Credit Facility is tied to a borrowing base, which is measured as (i) 75% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of the publicly traded equity securities we hold (other than shares of ACV Auctions, if any) plus (ii) the least of (a) 75% of the fair market value of the shares of ACV Auctions we hold, if any, (b) $6.25 million and (c) 25% of the aggregate borrowing base availability for the Credit Facility at any date of determination plus (iii) 50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of eligible private loans we hold that meet specified criteria plus (iv) the lesser of (a) 50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of unsecured private loans we hold that meet specified criteria and (b) $1.25 million minus (v) such reserves as the Lender may establish from time to time in its sole discretion. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of June 27, 2027. The outstanding balance drawn on the Credit Facility at September 30, 2024 was $3,900,000. Under the borrowing base formula described above, the unused line of credit balance for the Credit Facility was $21,100,000 at September 30, 2024.\n\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) or (ii) 0.25%. At September 30, 2024, our applicable interest rate was 8.46%.\n\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants usual and customary for agreements of this type, including among others covenants that prohibit, subject to certain specified exceptions, our ability to merge or consolidate with other companies, sell any material part of our assets, incur other indebtedness, incur liens on our assets, make investments or loans to third parties other than permitted investments and permitted loans, and declare any distribution or dividend other than certain permitted distributions. The Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: (i) a tangible net worth covenant that requires us to maintain a Tangible Net Worth (defined in the Credit Agreement as our aggregate assets, excluding intangible assets, less all of our liabilities) of not less than $50.0 million, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter, (ii) an asset coverage ratio covenant that requires us to maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of the fair market value of all of our assets to the sum of all of our obligations for borrowed money plus all capital lease obligations) of not less than 3:1, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter and (iii) an interest coverage ratio covenant that requires us to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) of not less than 2.5:1, which is measured quarterly on a trailing twelve-months basis. We believe we were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2024. See “Note 6. Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility” on our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our Credit Facility.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we experienced a net increase in cash of approximately $57,000, which is a net effect of approximately $14,550,000 of net cash provided by our operating activities and approximately $14,492,000 of net cash used in our financing activities.\n\nThe $14,550,000 of net cash provided by our operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted primarily from net investment income of approximately $1,208,000, approximately $24,852,000 from the sales of equity investments and repayments of debt investments, and an approximately $1,495,000 net increase in operating liabilities. This was partially offset by approximately $11,070,000 used to fund new or follow-on portfolio company investments, approximately $1,339,000 in non-cash interest income, and an approximately $499,000 net increase in operating assets.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $14,492,000. This is comprised of $12,350,000 repaid on the Credit Facility and approximately $2,142,000 in dividends paid to shareholders.\n\nWe anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through cash generated through our ongoing operating activities and through borrowings under the $25 million Credit Facility. We anticipate that we will continue to exit investments. However, the timing of liquidation events with respect to our privately held investments is difficult to project.\n\n47\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and the valuation of our investment portfolio.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nChanges in interest rates may affect our interest expense on the debt outstanding under our Credit Facility. Our debt borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25%. Changes in interest rates can also affect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, all of our debt investments had fixed interest rates and were not directly impacted by changes in market interest rates.\n\nBased on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of September 30, 2024, the following table shows the approximate annualized increase (decrease) in net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates under our Credit Facility, assuming no changes in our borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Because we often borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between our borrowing rate and the rate we earn on the invested proceeds borrowed. In periods of rising interest rates, the rate we earn on our debt investments with fixed interest rates will remain the same, while the interest incurred on our borrowings under the Credit Facility will increase.\n\nImpact on net investment income from a change in interest rates on our Credit Facility at:  \n---  \n1% | 2% | 3%  \nIncrease in interest rate | $ | (39,000 | ) | $ | (78,000 | ) | $ | (117,000 | )  \nDecrease in interest rate | 39,000 | 78,000 | 117,000  \n  \nAlthough we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity under our Credit Facility at September 30, 2024, it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality, size and composition of our investment portfolio, and other business developments, including borrowings under our Credit Facility, that could affect our net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis.\n\nWe do not currently engage in any hedging activities. However, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our borrowed funds.\n\nValuation Risk\n\nWe carry our investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by RCM and approved by our Board. Determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio company investment while employing a consistent valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments, there may be material risks associated with this determination including that estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the value realized on these investments to be different than the valuations that are assigned. The types of factors that we may take into account in valuation of our investments include, as relevant, third party valuations, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly-traded securities, recent sales of or offers to buy comparable companies, and other relevant factors.\n\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that this information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation’s controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.\n\n48\n\n[Table of Contents](#toc_page)\n\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is\nbeing recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Craig Mychajluk, Investor\nRelations. Thank you, Mr. Mychajluk, you may begin.\nCraig Mychajluk: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe appreciate your interest in Rand Capital and for joining us today for our third quarter 2024\nfinancial results conference call. On the line with me are Dan Penberthy, our President and\nChief Executive Officer; and Margaret Brechtel, our Executive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer. A copy of the release and slides that accompany our conversation is available\nat randcapital.com.\nIf you're following along with the slide deck, please turn to Slide 2, where I'd like to point out\nsome important information. As you are likely aware, we may make some forward-looking\nstatements during this presentation. These statements apply to future events that are subject to\nrisks and uncertainties as well as other factors that could cause actual results to differ from\nwhere we are today. You can find a summary of these risks and uncertainties and other factors\nin the earnings release and other documents filed by the company with the Securities and\nExchange Commission. These documents can be found on our website or at sec.gov.\nDuring today's call, we'll also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures, we believe these will\nbe useful in evaluating our performance, should not consider the presentation of this additional\ninformation in isolation or as a substitute for results in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. We have provided reconciliations of non-GAAP measures with\ncomparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's earnings release. With that,\nplease turn to Slide 3, and I’ll hand the discussion over to Dan.\nDan?\nDan Penberthy: Thank you, Craig, and good afternoon, everyone. Rand delivered another\nstrong quarter of performance, driven by disciplined execution and strategic positioning in a\ncomplex market environment. We achieved robust growth in total investment income, increasing\n27% over the prior year period to $2.2 million. This success was fueled by our commitment to\nbuilding a well-diversified income-generating portfolio, which included 5 new debt instruments\nover the year and enhanced fee income.\nOur net asset value per share rose 3% from the prior quarter and 16% year-to-date, reaching\n$27.29 at the end of the third quarter. This growth reflects our careful management of a $75\nmillion portfolio now concentrated 74% in debt investments with an overall yield of 13.8%.\nThese results underscore our focus on creating value through a balanced mix of assets that can\nweather today's economic headwinds while driving attractive returns.\nAdditionally, we successfully exited several key investments this quarter, including a notable\nsale of SciAps which provided us with $13.1 million in proceeds. We have also sold our final\npositions in 2 public BDCs, realizing proceeds of $1.3 million. This further strengthens our\nbalance sheet and also increases our capacity for future investments.\nWe initially allocated this capital to reducing our outstanding bank debt, lowering it by $13.3\nmillion leaving us with a balance of $3.9 million outstanding at quarter end. We have benefited\nPage 3 of 7\nRand Capital Corporation\nThird Quarter 2024 Teleconference Transcript\nNovember 6, 2024\nfrom recent Fed rate reduction and our debt pay downs and are seeing lower interest expenses\nand improved profitability, a positive trend that supports our overall financial performance.\nWith $24 million in total liquidity, we remain strategically positioned to capitalize our market\ndynamics as they unfold, making selective high-return investments that will further drive growth\nand long-term value.\nOur success in achieving strategic objectives over the past few years has translated into real\nbenefits for our shareholders, as highlighted on Slide 4. Over this time, we have steadily\nincreased our dividends with payouts rising from $0.44 per share in 2021 to $0.83 in 2022 and\n$1.33 in 2023. This year, as of Q3 2024, we have paid total dividends of $0.83 per share. Our\nfourth quarter dividend announcement is expected in early December.\nOur commitment to a robust balance sheet, optimized portfolio and strategic capital deployment\ngives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering meaningful returns for our shareholders\nwell into the future. Turning to Slide 5. You will see our portfolio's distribution between debt and\nequity, along with the recent changes.\nOur portfolio now stands at fair value of $75 million spread across 22 businesses. The fair value\nwas down approximately 14% sequentially, which reflects the successful exit from SciAps, along\nwith the stock sales and loan repayments from other portfolio companies. With the close of the\nSciAps transaction, we have progressed towards our goal of a more debt-focused portfolio. And\nas we have already noted, 74% of our investments are in debt structures, while the remaining\n26% is in equity investments in private companies.\nSlide 6 highlights our activity this past quarter, including a small follow-on debt investment. We\ndid invest $125,000 as a follow-on to ITA, a Florida-based manufacturer of blinds and shades.\nWith this additional investment, our total holdings in ITA across both debt and equity reached a\nfair value of $4.9 million at the quarter end. The bottom half of the slide showcases notable exits\nfor the quarter led by the successful sale of SciAps.\nAs noted, the exit generated $13.1 million in total proceeds. And this did include $2.1 million\nfrom a debt repayment, $165,000 in interest income and fees and a $10.8 million in equity\nreturn. This transaction resulted in a realized gain of $7.7 million for Rand. Additionally, we\nreceived $1.3 million in proceeds from the sale of our remaining shares in 2 publicly traded\nBDCs, Barings and FS KKR. These provided realized gains of $249,000 combined. Lastly, we\nexited our investment in Mezmeriz realizing a loss on an asset previously valued at 0.\nTurning to Slide 7. You will see the diversity of our portfolio and the shifts in our industry\nallocation since the second quarter. These changes reflect both the portfolio adjustments we\ndiscussed and the portfolio fair value updates. Notably, our professional services allocation\nincreased from 43% to 50% of our portfolio, while manufacturing decreased from 25% to 16%.\nAdditionally, with the sale of our BDC stocks, they are no longer represented in this industry\nmix. We view this industry diversity as a cornerstone of our strategic approach. By maintaining a\nwide range of sectors within our portfolio, we bolster resilience during economic challenges and\nbetter manage risk in our investment portfolio. At the end of the quarter, Slide 8 highlights our\ntop 5 portfolio companies.\nNotably, Tilson remains our largest fair value investment with a total value of $12.3 million,\nwhich has remained consistent with the previous quarter. Its share of our total portfolio has\nPage 4 of 7\nRand Capital Corporation\nThird Quarter 2024 Teleconference Transcript\nNovember 6, 2024\nincreased sequentially primarily due to a reduction in total assets resulting from the asset sales\nwe previously mentioned.\nAdditionally, following the sale of SciAps, ITA has entered the top 5 rankings. Together, these 5\ncompanies now represent 50% of our overall portfolio at quarter end. With that, I'll turn it over to\nMargaret to further review our financials in a much greater depth.\nMargaret Brechtel: Thanks, Dan, and good afternoon, everybody. I will start on Slide 10, which\nprovides an overview of our financial summary for the third quarter of 2024. Total investment\nincome for the quarter was $2.2 million, reflecting a 27% increase compared with the same\nquarter last year. This growth was primarily driven by a 27% rise in interest income attributed to\n5 new interest-yielding investments made over the past year.\nAdditionally, we experienced a $165,000 increase in fee income, largely due to the SciAps sale\nthat Dan mentioned. In total, 21 portfolio companies contributed to our investment income\nduring the quarter. On the expense side, total expenses for the third quarter amounted to\napproximately $1.3 million, up from $810,000 in the prior quarter. This increase included a\n$533,000 increase in incentive fees expense during the quarter. We did, however, benefit from\na $46,000 decrease in interest expenses due to debt paydowns during the quarter.\nIncentive fees are comprised of 2 components: an income-based fee and a capital gains fee,\nboth of which are contingent on meeting specified benchmarks. The income-based fee is\ncalculated quarterly based on the pre-incentive fee net investment income with a hurdle rate of\n1.75% per quarter or 7% annualized.\nFor the 3 months ending September 30, 2024, this fee accrued at $178,000 with no similar\nexpense incurred in the prior year period. The second component of the incentive fee is the\ncapital gains fees. According to GAAP, we are required to accrue a capital gains incentive fee\nbased on all our realized and unrealized gains and losses. Given the recent performance of our\nportfolio and realized gains, we recognized a higher accrual this quarter.\nWhen we adjust for accrued capital gains incentive fees, our adjusted expenses, which is a non-\nGAAP financial measure, were $1 million this quarter compared to $851,000 in the third quarter\nof 2023.\nFinally, our net investment income for the third quarter increased to $887,000 or $0.34 per\nshare from $799,000 or $0.31 per share in the same period last year. The adjusted net\ninvestment income per share, also a non-GAAP measure that excludes the capital gains\nincentive fee accrual expense was $0.46 per share, representing a 59% increase from $0.29\nper share in the last year's third quarter.\nOn Slide 11, you will see a waterfall graph illustrating the change in net asset value for the\nquarter. As of September 30, 2024, net assets totaled $70.4 million, representing a 3% increase\nfrom the end of the second quarter of 2024. This change was primarily driven by a net realized\ngain of $7.2 million from sales and dispositions of investments, which was partially offset by a\n$5.5 million net change in unrealized depreciation of investments.\nDuring the quarter, Rand distributed $748,000 in cash dividends to shareholders. Consequently,\nthe net asset value per share as of September 30, 2024, rose to $27.29 per share, up from\n$26.56 last quarter. As highlighted on Slide 12, we maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet\nthat positions us well for future investments. Total assets decreased by 12% to $79.8 million\nPage 5 of 7\nRand Capital Corporation\nThird Quarter 2024 Teleconference Transcript\nNovember 6, 2024\nprimarily due to the sale of SciAps and included approximately $3.4 million in cash at the end of\nthe quarter.\nAccording to our borrowing base formula, as of September 30, 2024, Rand had $21.1 million\navailable under its existing $25 million senior secured revolving credit facility. Our outstanding\nborrowings stood at $3.9 million with an interest rate of 8.46% at quarter end. We believe our\nstrategy in shifting the portfolio to incorporate more income-generating investments will enable\nus to maintain higher dividend levels over time.\nRand previously announced its third quarter dividend of $0.29 per share, which was paid on or\naround September 13, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 30, 2024. With that, I will\nturn the discussion back to Dan.\nDan Penberthy: Thanks, Margaret. Moving on to Slide 13. As we look ahead, our strategy\nremains clear, and we are energized by the multiple pathways we have to enhance both our\nincome and value creation. First, we continue to see significant potential in further expanding\nour debt portfolio, although we will always have the equity exposure, which will provide future\nlong-term gain potential.\nBy building on our history of successful debt investments, we are positioned to drive income\ngrowth through targeted strategic originations that align with our long-term objectives. We are\nalso committed to deploying available capital efficiently to fuel our growth. Our revolving credit\nfacility provides essential flexibility and recent reductions in Fed interest rates and hopefully\nsome more down the road, combined with debt paydowns, are already lowering our borrowing\ncosts.\nThese factors together set the stage for what we hope are strengthened profitability and\nincreased dividend potential both of which are important pillars of our commitment to our\nshareholders. Optimizing our portfolio holdings is another priority as we assess current market\nconditions rather to refine positions and maximize future returns.\nAdditionally, we recognize that our portfolio companies face a complex landscape with\ninflationary pressures, fluctuating interest rates and M&A challenges. Our role is to support the\nresilience, helping them navigate these headwinds so they can emerge even stronger.\nFinally, our commitment to driving shareholder returns is at the core of every decision we make.\nBy growing our investment income, we aim to support increased dividends, contributing to\nsustainable long-term value for our investors. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and\nconfident in our strategic direction to achieve these goals.\nThank you for joining us today and your ongoing interest in Rand Capital. We look forward to\nupdating you on 2 matters, the first is our fourth quarter dividend announcement expected in\nDecember and also our quarter and full year 2024 results, which will be reported in March. Have\na great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at\nthis time.

Our investment objective is to maximize\ntotal return to our shareholders with current income and capital appreciation\nby focusing our debt and related equity investments in privately-held, lower\nmiddle market companies with committed and experienced managements in\na broad variety of industries. We invest in businesses that have sustainable,\ndifferentiated and market-proven products, revenue of more than $10 million\nand EBITDA in excess of $1.5 million. Our investment activities are managed by\nour external investment adviser, Rand Capital Management, LLC.\nDividends Paid Per Share\n$1.33\n$0.83\n$0.44\n2021 2022 2023\nPortfolio Fair Value New Investments\n($ in millions) ($ in millions)\n$77.1 $19.7 $20.3\n$64.1\n$61.5\n$7.0\n2021 2022 2023 2021 2022 2023\nDear Shareholders,\n2023 was another year of progress and achievement at Rand. Amidst a dynamic and unique market\nlandscape, we remained steadfast in our commitment to driving investment returns and dividend growth.\nOverall, our results have been bolstered by the sustained growth in interest income, primarily attributed to\nthe continued deployment of capital focused on high-quality debt investments as part of our investment\nstrategy.\n2023 Highlights:\n• Dividend Distribution: We paid total dividends of $1.33 per share, comprising four regular quarterly\ndividends and a noteworthy special dividend in the fourth quarter.\n• Robust Investment Income: Our total investment income grew 27% to $7.3 million for the year,\nfueled by sustained growth in interest income from our portfolio companies.\n• Portfolio Expansion: The fair value of our investments rose to $77.1 million across 30 portfolio\nbusinesses, with a net increase of $15.6 million, or 25%, from the previous year.\n• Net Asset Value Increase: Our net asset value per share was $23.56 at year-end, a 5% increase\nfrom the prior year, net of dividends paid.\n• Strategic Investments: We deployed $20.3 million across nine transactions, strategically\ndiversifying our portfolio with four new portfolio companies and five follow-on investments,\npredominantly focused on income-producing assets.\nPortfolio expansion centered on income producing investments drove a higher return to\nshareholders\nThe commitment to portfolio optimization was evidenced by exiting certain portfolio positions and the\nmonetization of some equity investments. These transactions, combined with loan repayments, bolstered\nour cash position by approximately $10 million. Furthermore, drawing down over $13 million from our credit\nfacility enabled us to thoughtfully deploy capital, primarily into income-producing investments. As a result,\nour debt portfolio now constitutes 64% of our total portfolio compared with 56% at the end of 2022, leading\nto an enhanced portfolio yield.\nThe largest investment totaled $4.3 million in INEA, a stocking distributor of controlled expansion alloys,\nelectronic grade nickels, refractory grade metals and alloys, and soft magnetic alloys. Other new\ninvestments were $4.0 million in All About People, a full-service staffing and executive search firm with a\ngrowing focus on the healthcare industry; $3.8 million in First Coast Mulch, a commercial mulch installation\ncompany that covers the north and central Florida market; and $3.0 million in PressurePro, a family owned\nand operated company that has established itself as a market leader for branded tire pressure monitoring\nsystems consisting of a suite of proprietary hardware and software.\nIn addition, during the year, we made $5.2 million of follow-on investments in four existing portfolio\ncompanies – BMP Food Service Supply, ITA Acquisition, Tilson Technologies, and Caitec.\nAmidst these developments, we successfully exited our investment in Dealer Solutions and Designs,\nyielding significant returns for our shareholders. Notably, we received proceeds totaling $6.7 million,\nincluding a net gain of $2.5 million.\nWe believe transitioning our portfolio to include more income producing investments can support an\nincreased dividend level over time. During the second quarter of 2023, we raised our regular quarterly cash\ndividend by 20% or $0.05 per share. For the full year, we paid total dividends of $1.33 per share, which\nincluded a $0.38 per share special dividend paid in the fourth quarter. Our aggregate total dividends\nrepresented an increase of 60% over our 2022 dividends paid and 3x growth over 2021.\nPoised for continued growth in 2024\nWe intend to continue to grow and scale our business by focusing on debt and related equity investments in\nprivately held, lower middle market companies to drive investment income growth in order to increase the\ndividend paid.\nWe entered 2024 with diverse capital sources and over $19 million in available liquidity. We believe this,\ncoupled with prospective investment income and potential proceeds from portfolio exits, positions us\nfavorably to capitalize on new investment opportunities, while continuing to support existing portfolio\ncompanies that demonstrate growth potential.\nThe efforts of our external investment advisor, Rand Capital Management, coupled with their extensive\nnetwork of referral relationships, continues to yield a robust pipeline of investment opportunities. As we\nembark on the upcoming year, we are confident in our ability to leverage these resources to strengthen our\nportfolio, thereby driving earnings potential and delivering strong returns for our shareholders.\nThank you for your continued confidence and support as we navigate the path ahead.\nSincerely,\nRobert M.

Business\nRand Capital Corporation (“Rand”, “we”, “us” and “our”) was incorporated under the laws of New York in February 1969.\nWe completed our initial public offering in 1971 and operated as an internally managed, closed-end, management investment\ncompany from that time until November 2019.\nIn November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the “Closing”) with East Asset Management (“East”). The\ntransaction consisted of a $25 million investment in Rand by East, in the form of cash and contributed portfolio assets, in exchange for\napproximately 8.3 million shares of Rand common stock. East owns approximately 64% of Rand Capital’s outstanding common stock\nat December 31, 2023. Concurrent with the Closing, Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”), a registered investment adviser, was\nretained by Rand as its external investment adviser and administrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as our investment adviser\nand administrator are collectively referred to herein as the “Transaction”). The term of the new investment advisory and management\nagreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by our Board of\nDirectors (the “Board”) in October 2023 and is now set to expire on December 31, 2024. In addition, the term of the administration\nagreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with RCM was extended after its renewal was approved by the Board in October 2023\nand is now set to expire on December 31, 2024. The Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement can\ncontinue for successive annual periods after December 31, 2024 provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least\nannually by (i)(A) the affirmative vote of a majority of the Board or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting\nsecurities, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19)\nof the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\"), of us, RCM or our respective affiliates. Pursuant to the terms\nof the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an incentive fee, if specified\nbenchmarks are met.\nIn connection with the Closing, we also entered into a shareholder agreement by and between Rand and East (the\n“Shareholder Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has the right to designate two or three persons,\ndepending upon the size of the Board, for nomination for election to the Board. East has the right to designate (i) up to two persons if\nthe size of the Board is composed of fewer than seven directors or (ii) up to three persons if the size of the Board is composed of seven\nor more directors. East’s right to designate persons for nomination for election to the Board under the Shareholder Agreement is the\nexclusive means by which East may designate or nominate persons for election to the Board. The Board currently consists of five\ndirectors, and East has designated Adam S. Gusky and Benjamin E. Godley for nomination to the Board.\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. We have elected to be\nregulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the 1940 Act. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain\nregulatory requirements specified in the 1940 Act. For instance, we generally have to invest at least 70% of our total assets in\n“qualifying assets” and provide managerial assistance to the portfolio companies in which we invest. See “Item 1. Business -\nRegulations.”\nPrior to 2021, we made the majority of our investments through our wholly owned subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC, Inc.\n(“Rand SBIC”), which operated as a small business investment company (“SBIC”) and was licensed by the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration (“SBA”) from 2002 to 2021. Until December 2021, Rand SBIC also operated as a BDC.\nIn November 2021, Rand SBIC repaid, in full, 100% of its outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures and surrendered its SBIC\nlicense. In connection with the surrender of its SBIC license, Rand SBIC changed its name to Rand Capital Sub, Inc. (“Rand Sub”),\nwithdrew its election to be regulated as a BDC, and merged with and into Rand Capital Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability\ncompany, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rand.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, (“Annual Report”), unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, the “Corporation”,\n“us”, and “our” refer to Rand Capital Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nIn connection with the completion of the Transaction, we have shifted to an investment strategy focused on higher yielding\ndebt investments and elected U.S. Federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) as of January 1, 2020 on our U.S.\nFederal tax return for the 2020 tax year. As required for the RIC election, we paid a special dividend to shareholders to distribute all of\nour accumulated earnings and profits since inception to 2019. In order to continue to qualify as a RIC, Rand holds several of its equity\ninvestments in holding companies that facilitate a tax structure that is advantageous to the RIC election. These wholly owned\nsubsidiaries (the \"Blocker Corps\") are consolidated using United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") for\nfinancial reporting purposes.\n1\nRand's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") declared the following cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nDividend/Share\nQuarter Amount Record Date Payment Date Type\n1st $ 0.20 March 13, 2023 March 27, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n2nd $ 0.25 May 31, 2023 June 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n3rd $ 0.25 August 31, 2023 September 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.25 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.38 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Special\nThe Board declared the following cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2022:\nDividend/Share\nQuarter Amount Record Date Payment Date Type\n1st $ 0.15 March 14, 2022 March 28, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n2nd $ 0.15 June 1, 2022 June 15, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n3rd $ 0.15 September 1, 2022 September 15, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.20 December 19, 2022 December 30, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.18 December 19, 2022 December 30, 2022 Special\nRand effected a 1-for-9 reverse stock split of its common stock effective May 21, 2020. The reverse stock split affected all\nissued and outstanding shares of Rand's common stock, including shares held in treasury. The reverse stock split reduced the number\nof issued and outstanding shares of Rand’s common stock from 23,845,470 shares and 23,304,424 shares, respectively, to 2,648,916\nshares and 2,588,800 shares, respectively. The reverse stock split affected all shareholders uniformly and did not alter any\nshareholder's percentage interest in Rand’s outstanding common stock, except for adjustments for fractional shares.\nOn October 7, 2020, Rand, RCM and certain of their affiliates received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) to permit Rand to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain affiliates, including other BDCs and registered\ninvestment companies, managed by RCM and certain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with Rand’s investment objective,\npolicies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). On\nMarch 29, 2021, the SEC granted Rand, Callodine Group, LLC (“Callodine”), which holds a controlling interest in RCM, and certain\nof their affiliates a new exemptive order (the “New Order”) that superseded the Order and permits Rand to co-invest with affiliates\nmanaged by RCM and Callodine. Callodine is a yield focused asset management platform. Pursuant to the New Order, Rand is\ngenerally permitted to co-invest with affiliates covered by the New Order if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the\n1940 Act) of Rand’s independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1)\nthe terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Rand and its shareholders and do not\ninvolve overreaching in respect of Rand or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with\nthe interests of Rand’s shareholders and is consistent with Rand’s investment objective and strategies and, (3) the investment by\nRand’s affiliates would not disadvantage Rand, and Rand’s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous\nthan that on which Rand’s affiliates are investing. In addition, on September 6, 2022, the SEC granted an amendment to the New\nOrder to permit Rand to participate in follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds (as\ndefined in the New Order) that do not hold any investments in such existing portfolio companies.\nOur corporate office is located in Buffalo, NY and our website address is www.randcapital.com. We make available on our\nwebsite our annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information as soon as reasonably practicable after such material\nis filed with the SEC. Our shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “RAND.”\nOur Investment Objectives and Strategy\nOur investment activities are managed by our external investment adviser, RCM. Our investment objective is to generate\ncurrent income and, when possible, complement this current income with capital appreciation. As a result, the investments made by\nRand during 2023 were, and the investments to be made by Rand in the future are expected to be, made primarily in debt instruments.\nAt times when excess cash is available on our balance sheet, we may also invest in high yielding publicly traded equity instruments\nthat provide income through dividends and are relatively more liquid than our private company equity investments.\nWe expect to co-invest in privately held, lower middle market companies with committed and experienced management in a\nbroad variety of industries. We seek to invest in businesses that have sustainable, differentiated and market-accepted products and\nhave revenue of greater than $10 million and a path to free cash flow or are already generating greater than $1.5 million in EBITDA.\n2\nWe primarily provide funding to companies that need growth or expansion capital or are looking to finance an ownership transition.\nWe typically are a minority investor and work with other lenders, investment partners and sponsors to source and fund investment\nopportunities.\nGoing forward, our initial investment in any one portfolio company is expected to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million .\nThe debt instruments we invest in are not expected to be rated by any rating agency and, if they were, would be expected to be below\ninvestment grade. Because of the higher risk nature of our investments, we seek board observation or information rights and may\nrequire a board seat.\nThe maximum size of our investment in any single portfolio company and the diversification of our overall portfolio is\nsubject to compliance with SEC and IRS regulation requirements.\nWe may engage in various investment strategies to achieve our investment objectives based on the types of opportunities we\ndiscover and the competitive landscape. We expect to focus on current cash yields in order to achieve our income producing goals.\nOur Investment Process\nThe investment process is comprised of the sourcing and qualifying of investment opportunities, evaluating and negotiating\nthe investment instrument and documentation, due diligence of the business plan, operations and prospects of the prospective investee\nand follow through investment monitoring, follow on investments and portfolio management.\nRCM’s investment team identifies investment opportunities through a network of investment referral relationships.\nInvestment proposals may come to RCM or us from other sources, including unsolicited proposals from companies and referrals from\naccountants, bankers, lawyers and other members of the financial community. We believe that RCM’s and our reputation and\nexperience in the investment community provide a competitive advantage in originating quality investments.\nIn a typical private financing, a member of RCM’s investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) will review and\nanalyze through due diligence, the business plan and operations of the potential portfolio company. Additionally, the Investment\nCommittee will familiarize themselves with the portfolio company’s industry and competitive landscape and may conduct reference\nchecks with its customers and suppliers. RCM’s Investment Committee will then review the transaction and, if approved, the\ntransaction will be funded by Rand.\nFollowing our initial investment, we may make follow-on investments to take advantage of warrants or other preferential\nrights granted to us to increase or maintain our position in a promising portfolio company or provide additional funds to allow a\nportfolio company to fully implement its business plans, develop a new line of business or recover from unexpected business\nproblems. Follow-on investments in a portfolio company are evaluated on an individual basis by RCM’s Investment Committee.\nDisposition of Investments\nWe may exit investments upon the maturity of a debt security or when a liquidity event takes place, such as the sale,\nrecapitalization, or initial public offering of a portfolio company. The method and timing of the disposition of our portfolio\ninvestments can be critical to the realization of maximum total return. We generally expect to dispose of our equity securities through\nprivate sales of securities to other investors or through the sale or merger of the portfolio company. We anticipate the principal\namount of our debt investments will be repaid with interest and we may realize further appreciation from warrants or other equity type\ninstruments received in connection with an investment.\nCurrent Portfolio Companies\nFor a description of our current portfolio company investments, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations – Composition of the Investment Portfolio.”\nCompetition\nWe compete for quality investments with other venture capital firms, individual investors, business development companies,\nand investment funds (including private equity funds and mezzanine funds). We believe we are able to compete with these entities\nprimarily on the basis of RCM’s and our referral network, RCM’s and our investing reputation and experience, RCM’s responsive,\n3\nquick, and efficient investment analysis and decision-making process, the size of our initial investment, and the investment terms we\noffer. For information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\nEmployees\nWe do not have any employees. Our operations are managed by RCM, our investment adviser and administrator.\nDaniel Penberthy serves as President and Chief Executive Officer of Rand and Margaret Brechtel serves as Executive Vice\nPresident, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Rand. Daniel Penberthy and Margaret Brechtel also serve as officers of\nRCM, our investment adviser and administrator.\nWe reimburse our administrator, RCM, for the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing\nits obligations, on behalf of Rand, under the Administration Agreement. For a more detailed discussion of the administration\nagreement with RCM, see “Administration Agreement” below.\nInvestment Advisory and Management Agreement\nRCM serves as our investment adviser (the “Adviser”) under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement. The\nAdviser is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Adviser manages the\ninvestment and reinvestment of our assets and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:\n(i) determines the composition of Rand’s portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes therein and the manner of\nimplementing such changes;\n(ii) identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments;\n(iii) executes, closes, services and monitors the investments;\n(iv) determines the securities and other assets that we will purchase, retain or sell;\n(v) performs due diligence on prospective portfolio companies and investments;\n(vi) provides us with other investment advisory, research and related services that may, from time to time, be required for the\ninvestment of our assets; and\n(vii) assists us in the valuation of portfolio investments.\nThe Adviser’s services under the Investment Management Agreement are not exclusive, and it does furnish similar services\nto other entities and funds. In addition, subject to compliance with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Adviser is authorized to enter\ninto one or more sub-advisory agreements with other investment advisors (each a “Sub-Advisor”), including for purposes of\nrecommending specific securities or other investments based upon our investment objectives and policies, and working, along with the\nAdviser, in structuring, negotiating, arranging or effecting the acquisition or disposition of our investments and monitoring our\ninvestments. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser, and not us, will be responsible for any\ncompensation payable to any Sub-Advisor.\nAbout the Investment Process of the Adviser\nThe Adviser’s principal investment portfolio managers are Daniel Penberthy and Scott Barfield, who collectively manage the\nAdviser on a day-to-day basis. All decisions to acquire or dispose of assets on our behalf are made by the Adviser’s Investment\nCommittee. Each decision must be approved by a majority vote of the Investment Committee members.\nFrom January 1, 2023 to March 1, 2023, the Investment Committee was comprised of the following five individuals:\n• Scott Barfield;\n• Brian Collins;\n• Adam Gusky;\n• James Morrow; and\n• Daniel Penberthy.\n4\nFrom March 2, 2023 to December 31, 2023, the Investment Committee was comprised of the following five individuals:\n• Scott Barfield;\n• Brian Collins;\n• Steven Brannon;\n• James Morrow; and\n• Daniel Penberthy.\nWe believe that each member of the Investment Committee during 2023 had significant and substantial experience making\nand managing investments in debt and equity instruments that are consistent with our investment objectives and strategies across\nmarket cycles and industries. We believe that the experience and investing acumen of RCM’s Investment Committee provides us with\na competitive advantage in identifying, originating, investing in and managing a portfolio of investments in lower middle-market\ncompanies.\nAll potential investment opportunities undergo an initial informal review by members of the Investment Committee and each\npotential investment opportunity that is determined to have merit is then presented and evaluated at Investment Committee meetings in\nwhich the members of the Investment Committee discuss the qualities and risks of that potential investment opportunity and the\npricing and structure for the investment.\nFees Paid to Adviser\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement, we pay the Adviser, as compensation for the investment advisory and\nmanagement services, fees consisting of two components: (i) the Base Management Fee; and (ii) the Incentive Fees.\nBase Management Fee\nThe “Base Management Fee” is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents\nbut including assets purchased with borrowed funds), determined according to procedures duly adopted by the Board.\nThe Base Management Fee is calculated based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents\nbut including assets purchased with borrowed funds) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters.\nIncentive Fees\nThe “Incentive Fees” are comprised of two parts: (1) the Income Based Fee; and (2) the Capital Gains Fee.\nIncome Based Fee\nThe “Income Based Fee” is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment\nIncome for the immediately preceding calendar quarter and is payable promptly following the filing of our financial statements for\nsuch quarter.\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement, “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” is defined as interest income,\ndividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as\ncommitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees we receive from portfolio companies) we accrue during the\nrelevant calendar quarter, minus the operating expenses for such calendar quarter (including the Base Management Fee, expenses\npayable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred\nstock, but excluding any portion of Incentive Fee).\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes any accretion of original issue discount, market discount, payment-in-kind\ninterest, payment-in-kind dividends or other types of deferred or accrued income, including in connection with zero coupon securities,\nthat we have recognized in accordance with GAAP, but have not yet received in cash (collectively, “Accrued Unpaid Income”). Pre-\nIncentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized and unrealized capital losses, or unrealized\ncapital appreciation or depreciation.\n5\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets\nless indebtedness) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a “hurdle rate”, expressed as a rate of\nreturn on the value of our net assets at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized).\nWe pay the Adviser an Incentive Fee with respect to our Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar quarter as follows:\n(i) no Income Based Fee in any quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter does not\nexceed the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized);\n(ii) 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-\nIncentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00%\nannualized) but is less than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized); and\n(iii) 20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion\nof the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% (8.75%\nannualized).\nHowever, the Income Based Fee paid to the Adviser shall not be in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap. The “Incentive Fee Cap”\nfor any quarter is an amount equal to (1) 20.0% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Income Based\nFee Calculation Period (as defined below) minus (2) the aggregate Income Based Fee that was paid in respect of the calendar quarters\nincluded in the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period.\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Income Based Fee Calculation Period” is defined as, with\nreference to a calendar quarter, the period of time consisting of such calendar quarter and the additional quarters that comprise the\neleven calendar quarters immediately preceding such calendar quarter.\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Cumulative Net Return” is defined as (1) the aggregate net\ninvestment income in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period minus (2) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect\nof the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, we pay no\nIncome Based Fee to the Adviser for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is\nless than the Income Based Fee that is payable to the Adviser for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap)\ncalculated as described above, we pay an Income Based Fee to the Adviser equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any\nquarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Income Based Fee that is payable to the Adviser for such\nquarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, we pay an Income Based Fee to the Adviser\nequal to the Income Based Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Net Capital Loss,” in respect of a particular period, means the\ndifference, if positive, between (1) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period minus (2) aggregate capital\ngains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.\nAny Income Based Fee otherwise payable under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to Accrued Unpaid\nIncome (such fees being the “Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees”) shall be deferred, on a security-by-security basis, and shall\nbecome payable to the Adviser only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received by us in respect of any Accrued Unpaid Income.\nAny Accrued Unpaid Income that is subsequently reversed by us in connection with a write-down, write-off, impairment, or similar\ntreatment of the investment giving rise to such Accrued Unpaid Income will, in the applicable period of reversal, (1) reduce Pre-\nIncentive Fee Net Investment Income and (2) reduce the amount of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees. Subsequent payments of\nAccrued Unpaid Income Based Fees that are deferred shall not reduce the amounts otherwise payable for any quarter as an Income\nBased Fee.\nCapital Gains Fee\nThe “Capital Gains Fee” is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the\nInvestment Management Agreement). Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is calculated\nat the end of each applicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate\nunrealized capital depreciation from (2) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from the effective date\nof the Prior Investment Management Agreement. If this amount is positive at the end of any calendar year, then the Capital Gains Fee\nfor such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the cumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If\nsuch amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee payable for that calendar year. If the Investment Management Agreement\nis terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end, the termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for\npurposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains Fee.\n6\nFor purposes of the Capital Gains Fee:\n• The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the\nnet sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such\ninvestment.\n• The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price\nof each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\n• The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the\nvaluation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date minus (b) the\naccreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\nThe accreted or amortized cost basis of an investment shall mean, with respect to an investment owned by us as of the\neffective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement, the fair value of that investment as set forth in our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019, as filed with the SEC on November 7, 2019, and, with respect to an\ninvestment acquired by us subsequent to the effective date of the Prior Investment Management Agreement or the Investment\nManagement Agreement, the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment as reflected in the our financial statements.\nExample 1: Income Based Fee Calculations: *\nAlternative 1\nAssumptions:\nInvestment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25%\nHurdle rate(1) = 1.75%\nBase Management Fee(2) = 0.375%\nOther expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (Base Management Fee + other expenses)) = 0.675%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate, therefore there is no Income Based Fee is payable\nfor the calendar quarter.\nAlternative 2\nAssumptions:\nInvestment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.70%\nHurdle rate(1) = 1.75%\nBase Management Fee(2) = 0.375%\nOther expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (Base Management Fee + other expenses)) = 2.125%\nIncome Based Fee (subject to “catch up”)(3) = 100.00% × (2.125% – 1.75%) = 0.375%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the “catch-up” provision,\ntherefore the Income Based Fee payable for the calendar quarter is 0.375%.\nAlternative 3\nAssumptions:\nInvestment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50%\nHurdle rate(1) = 1.75%\nBase Management Fee(2) = 0.375%\nOther expenses (legal, accounting, transfer agent, etc.) = 0.20%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (investment income – (Base Management Fee + other expenses)) = 2.925%\n7\nIncome Based Fee (subject to “catch up”)(3) = 100.00% × “catch-up” + (20.00% × (Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income\nabove 2.1875%))\nCatch-up = 2.1875% – 1.75% = 0.4375%\nIncome Based Fee = (100.00% × .4375%) + (20.00% × (2.925% – 2.1875%))\n= 0.4375% + (20.00% × 0.7375%)\n= 0.4375% + 0.1475%\n= 0.585%\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the “catch-up” provision, therefore the\nIncome Based Fee payable for the calendar quarter is 0.585%.\n* For ease of review, (i) the hypothetical amounts of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, investment income, Base\nManagement Fee, other expenses, and Income Based Fee are each expressed as a percentage of total assets, though as\ndescribed in greater detail above, each of these amounts are calculated as a numerical dollar amount as set forth in the\nInvestment Management Agreement, (ii) the hypothetical amount of the Base Management Fee is assumed to be consistent\nfrom quarter to quarter, and (iii) these examples each assume that the Incentive Fee Cap is not yet in effect.\n(1) Represents 7.00% annualized hurdle rate.\n(2) Represents 1.50% annualized Base Management Fee.\n(3) The “catch-up” provision is intended to provide the Adviser with an Income Based Fee of 20.00% on all Pre-Incentive\nFee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when Rand’s Pre-Incentive Net Investment Income exceeds\n1.75% in any calendar quarter.\nExample 2: Capital Gains Fee Calculations:\nAlternative 1\nAssumptions:\nYear 1: $20.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), and $30.0 million investment made in Company B\n(“Investment B”)\nYear 2: Investment A sold for $50.0 million and fair market value (“FMV”) of Investment B determined to be $32.0 million\nYear 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million\nYear 4: Investment B sold for $31.0 million\nThe Capital Gains Fees, if any, would be calculated as follows:\nYear 1: None\nYear 2: Capital Gains Fee of $6.0 million — ($30.0 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20.0%)\nYear 3: None — $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by ($30.0 million cumulative capital gains less $5.0 million cumulative capital\ndepreciation)) less $6.0 million (previous Capital Gains Fee paid in Year 2)\nYear 4: Capital Gains Fee of $0.2 million — $6.2 million ($31.0 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20.0%) less\n$6.0 million (Capital Gains Fee taken in Year 2)\nAlternative 2\nAssumptions:\nYear 1: $20.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $30.0 million investment made in Company B (“Investment\nB”) and $25.0 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)\nYear 2: Investment A sold for $50.0 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25.0 million and FMV of Investment C\ndetermined to be $25.0 million\nYear 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27.0 million and Investment C sold for $30.0 million\nYear 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $35.0 million\nYear 5: Investment B sold for $20.0 million\nThe Capital Gains Fees, if any, would be calculated as follows:\nYear 1: None\nYear 2: $5.0 million Capital Gains Fee - 20.0% multiplied by $25.0 million ($30.0 million realized capital gains on Investment A less\n$5.0 million unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B)\nYear 3: $1.4 million Capital Gains Fee - $6.4 million (20.0% multiplied by $32.0 million ($35.0 million cumulative realized capital\ngains less $3.0 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5.0 million Capital Gains Fee received in Year 2\n8\nYear 4: $0.6 million Capital Gains Fee - $7.0 million (20.0% multiplied by $35.0 million cumulative realized capital gains) less\ncumulative $6.4 million Capital Gains Fee received in Year 2 and Year 3\nYear 5: None — $5.0 million (20.0% multiplied by $25.0 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35.0 million less realized\ncapital losses of $10.0 million)) less $7.0 million cumulative Capital Gains Fee paid in Year 2, Year 3 and Year 4\nPayment of Expenses\nUnder the terms of Investment Management Agreement, all investment professionals of the Adviser and its staff, when and to\nthe extent engaged in providing investment advisory services to us, and the compensation of such personnel and the general office and\nfacilities and overhead expenses incurred by the Adviser in maintaining its place of business allocable to these services, are provided,\nand paid for by the Adviser and not by us. We will bear all other costs and expenses of its operations and transactions, related to the\nCorporation, including those relating to:\n(i) organization;\n(ii) calculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n(iii) expenses incurred by the Adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring\nfinancial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on prospective portfolio\ncompanies;\n(iv) interest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments;\n(v) offerings of our common stock and other securities;\n(vi) investment advisory and management fees payable under the Investment Management Agreement, but excluding any\nfees payable to any Sub-Adviser;\n(vii) administration fees payable under the Administration Agreement;\n(viii) transfer agent and custodial fees;\n(ix) federal and state registration fees;\n(x) all costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange;\n(xi) federal, state and local taxes;\n(xii) directors’ fees and expenses;\n(xiii) costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies (including the SEC);\n(xiv) costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to shareholders, including printing costs;\n(xv) our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other\ninsurance premiums;\n(xvi) direct costs and expenses of administration, including independent auditors and outside legal costs; and\n(xvii) all other expenses incurred by us or the Adviser in connection with administering our business (including payments\nunder the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the Adviser’s overhead in performing its\nobligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief\nfinancial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs (including travel expenses)).\nIndemnification under the Investment Management Agreement\nThe Investment Management Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the\nperformance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, the Adviser, its members and their\nrespective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person affiliated with any of\nthem (collectively, the “Indemnified Parties”), are entitled to indemnification from us for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses\n(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) incurred by the Indemnified Parties in or by reason\nof any pending, threatened or completed action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (including an action or suit by or in the right of\nus or our security holders) arising out of or otherwise based upon the performance of any of the Adviser’s duties or obligations under\nthe Investment Management Agreement or otherwise as an investment adviser.\n9\nDuration and Termination\nThe Investment Management Agreement was executed on December 31, 2020 and had an initial term of two years after this\ndate. Our Board approved the Investment Management Agreement on October 29, 2020 and it was approved by our shareholders at\nthe Special Meeting held on December 16, 2020. Thereafter, the Investment Management Agreement will continue to renew\nautomatically for successive annual periods so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by:\n(i) the vote of our Board, or by the vote of shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Rand; and\n(ii) the vote of a majority of our independent directors, in either case, in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act.\nOn October 18, 2023, our Board, including all four independent directors, approved the renewal of the Investment\nManagement Agreement for a period of twelve months commencing December 31, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2024.\nThe Investment Management Agreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, upon sixty\ndays’ written notice, by: (a) vote of a majority of the Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of Rand (as\ndefined in the 1940 Act); or (b) the Adviser. Furthermore, the Investment Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the\nevent of its “assignment” (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 15(a)(4) of the 1940 Act). See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors\n- Our investment adviser and administrator, RCM, has the right to resign on sixty days’ notice, and we may not be able to find a\nsuitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition,\nbusiness and results of operations.”\nNotwithstanding the termination or expiration of the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser will be entitled to any\namounts owed as payment of the Base Management Fees and the Incentive Fees through the date of termination or expiration.\nAdministration Agreement\nIn connection with the Closing, we entered into the Prior Administration Agreement with the Adviser, and on December 31,\n2020, concurrent with the execution of the Investment Management Agreement, we entered into the Administration Agreement with\nthe Adviser. Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Adviser agreed to perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the\nperformance of) the administrative services necessary for our operations, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment,\nclerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as\nthe Adviser, subject to review by the Board, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to perform its obligations\nunder the Administration Agreement. The Adviser also, on our behalf, arranges for the services of, and oversees, custodians,\ndepositories, transfer agents, dividend disbursing agents, other shareholder servicing agents, accountants, attorneys, underwriters,\nbrokers and dealers, corporate fiduciaries, insurers, banks, and such other persons in any such other capacity deemed to be necessary\nor desirable. The Adviser makes reports to our Board regarding the performance of its obligations under the Administration\nAgreement and furnishes advice and recommendations with respect to such other aspects of our business and affairs as it determines to\nbe desirable.\nThe Adviser is responsible for our financial and other records that are required to be maintained and prepares all reports and\nother materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority, including reports to shareholders. In addition, the\nAdviser assists us in determining and publishing our Net Asset Value (“NAV”), overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax\nreturns, and the preparation and dissemination of reports to shareholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and\nthe performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. The Adviser provides, on our behalf, significant\nmanagerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.\nIn full consideration of the provision of the services of the Adviser, we reimburse the Adviser for the costs and expenses\nincurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities. Costs and expenses to be paid by us\ninclude those relating to: organization; calculating NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\nexpenses incurred by the Adviser payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring our financial\nand legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on its prospective portfolio companies; interest\npayable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments; offerings of our common stock and other securities; investment advisory\nand management fees (other than fees (if any) payable to a sub-advisor retained by the Adviser under the Investment Management\nAgreement); administration fees; transfer agent and custodial fees; federal and state registration fees; all costs of registration and\nlisting of our common stock on any securities exchange; federal, state, local and other taxes; directors’ fees and expenses; costs of\npreparing and filing reports or other documents required by governmental bodies (including the SEC); costs of any reports, proxy\nstatements or other notices to shareholders, including printing costs; our allocable portion of the fidelity bond, directors and\nofficers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums; direct costs and expenses of administration,\nincluding independent auditors and outside legal costs; and all other expenses incurred by us or the Adviser in connection with\n10\nadministering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement based upon our allocable portion of the\nAdviser’s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, and our allocable portion of the cost of the\nchief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs (including travel expenses).\nThe Administration Agreement was executed on December 31, 2020, the same date as the Investment Management\nAgreement, and had an initial term of two years after that date, and thereafter will continue automatically for successive annual\nperiods so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the Board, including a majority of the independent\ndirectors. On October 18, 2023, our Board, including all four independent directors, approved the renewal of the Administration\nAgreement for a period of twelve months commencing December 31, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2024. The Administration\nAgreement may be terminated at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by vote of our directors, or by the Adviser, upon 60\ndays’ written notice to the other party. The Administration Agreement may not be assigned by a party without the consent of the other\nparty.\nRegulations\nThe following discussion is a general summary of the material laws and regulations governing BDCs. It does not purport to\nbe a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs.\nWe have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Although the 1940 Act exempts a BDC from registration\nunder the 1940 Act as a registered investment company, the 1940 Act contains significant limitations on the operations of BDCs.\nAmong other things, the 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between a BDC and its affiliates,\nprincipal underwriters and affiliates of its affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act also prohibits a BDC from changing the nature of\nits business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw its election as, a BDC unless so authorized by a vote of the holders of a majority of its\noutstanding voting securities. BDCs are not required to maintain fundamental investment policies relating to diversification and\nconcentration of investments within a single industry. More specifically, in order to qualify as a BDC, a company must:\n(1) be a domestic company;\n(2) have registered a class of its equity securities or have filed a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to Section 12\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”);\n(3) operate for the purpose of investing in the securities of certain types of companies, namely immature or emerging\ncompanies and businesses suffering or just recovering from financial distress. Generally, a BDC must be primarily\nengaged in the business of furnishing capital and providing managerial expertise to companies that do not have ready\naccess to capital through conventional financial channels. Such companies are termed “eligible portfolio companies;”\n(4) extend significant managerial assistance to such portfolio companies; and\n(5) have a majority of “disinterested” directors (as defined in the 1940 Act).\nAs a BDC, we are required under the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, to meet an asset coverage ratio computed as\nthe value of the Corporation’s total assets (less total liabilities other than senior securities) to total senior securities, which includes all\nof our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future, in order to incur borrowings and issue debt securities. In\naddition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our shareholders or\nthe repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or\nrepurchase.\nOn January 24, 2024, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of\nthe Board, approved the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, our asset\ncoverage requirement under the 1940 Act for senior securities will be changed from 200% to 150%, effective January 24, 2025 (i.e.,\nwe will be able to borrow up to two dollars for every dollar we have in assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by\nsenior securities issued by us). We monitor our compliance with this coverage ratio on a regular basis.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our asset coverage ratio, as computed in accordance with the 1940 Act, was 474.2% and\n2,363.6%, respectively.\nQualifying Assets\nUnder the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act,\nwhich are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of their\ntotal assets. An eligible portfolio company is, generally, a private domestic operating company, or a public domestic operating\n11\ncompany whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange. In addition, any small business investment company that is\nlicensed by the SBA and is a wholly owned subsidiary of a BDC is an eligible portfolio company.\nQualifying assets include:\n(1) securities of companies that were eligible portfolio companies at the time the BDC acquired their securities;\n(2) securities of bankrupt or insolvent companies that were eligible at the time of the BDC’s initial acquisition of their\nsecurities but are no longer eligible, provided that the BDC has maintained a substantial portion of its initial investment\nin those companies;\n(3) securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to any of the foregoing; and\n(4) cash items, government securities and high-quality short-term debt.\nThe 1940 Act also places restrictions on the nature of the transactions in which, and the persons from whom, securities can be\npurchased in order for the securities to be considered qualifying assets.\nA BDC is permitted to invest in the securities of public companies and other investments that are not qualifying assets, but\nthose non-qualifying investments may not exceed 30% of the BDC’s total asset value at the time of the investment. At December 31,\n2023, we were in compliance with this rule.\nManagerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies\nIn order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for purposes of the 70% test discussed above, a BDC must either\ncontrol the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC\npurchases the securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make\navailable such managerial assistance. Making available significant managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement\nwhereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or external adviser, offers to provide and, if accepted, does so provide, significant\nguidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company through\nmonitoring of portfolio company operations, selective participation in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising\na portfolio company’s officers or other organizational or financial guidance.\nTaxation as a Regulated Investment Company\nThe Corporation elected U.S. federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) as of January 1, 2020 under\nsubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, on our U.S. Federal tax return for the 2020 tax year. In order to\nqualify to make the RIC election, we, among other things, distributed our previously undistributed “accumulated earnings and profits”\nto shareholders, through the special dividend paid to shareholders in May 2020. RIC qualifications also require meeting specified\nsource-of-income and asset-diversification requirements. In addition, in order to maintain our RIC status, we must distribute to our\nshareholders, with respect of each taxable year, dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount generally at least equal to\n90% of our “investment company taxable income,” which is generally equal to the sum of our net ordinary income plus the excess of\nour realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for\ndistributions paid (the “Annual Distribution Requirement”). As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal\nincome taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally\nwill be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal\nexcise, state, local and foreign taxes. Additionally, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any\nincome earned on certain investments that need to remain in a taxable subsidiary in order to maintain RIC status.\nWe will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a\ntimely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of:\n(1) 98% of our ordinary income for each calendar year;\n(2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year; and\n(3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax.\nIn order to maintain qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes going forward, we must, among other things:\n(1) meet the Annual Distribution Requirement;\n(2) qualify to be regulated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act;\n12\n(3) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain\nsecurities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or currencies or other income derived\nwith respect to the business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in\na “qualified publicly-traded partnership” (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code); and\n(4) diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year:\n(a) at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities\nof other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of\nthe value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these\npurposes includes the equity securities of a “qualified publicly-traded partnership”); and\n(b) no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities\nor securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer, (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under\napplicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of\none or more “qualified publicly-traded partnerships”.\nWe may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold\ndebt obligations that have original issue discount (OID) or debt instruments with payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, we must include in\nincome, each year, a portion of this non-cash income that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash is received\nby us in that taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as\ndeferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or\nstock. Because any OID income or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of\naccrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even\nthough we will not have received any corresponding cash.\nUnder the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our shareholders while our debt obligations and other\nsenior securities are outstanding unless certain “asset coverage” tests are met. If we are prohibited to make distributions, we may fail\nto qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and become subject to tax as an ordinary corporation.\nAs long as we qualify for taxation as a RIC, distributions out of our earnings and profits to shareholders generally will be\ntaxable to shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, either as ordinary income or capital gains, depending upon the nature of\nthe income giving rise to the distribution. The tax consequences to a shareholder attributable to the acquisition, ownership, and\ndisposition of our common stock, are complex and will depend on the facts of the shareholder’s unique circumstances.\n13\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this annual report\non Form 10-K, the following information should be carefully considered before making an investment in our common stock. The risk\nfactors described below are the principal risk factors associated with an investment in our securities, as well as those factors generally\nassociated with a business development company with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets\nsimilar to ours. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or\nnot presently deemed material by us might also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our NAV and the\ntrading price of our common stock could decline, resulting in potential investment loss.\nWe have listed below the risk factors applicable to us grouped into the following categories: Risks related to our Business\nand Structure, Risks related to our Investments, Risks related to our Indebtedness, Risks related to our Common Stock and Risks\nRelating to U.S. Federal Income Tax.\nRisks related to our Business and Structure\nWe are dependent upon RCM for our future success.\nOur day-to-day investment operations are managed by our investment adviser and administrator, RCM, subject to oversight\nby our Board. After the completion of the Transaction, we no longer have any employees, and, as a result, RCM’s investment team\nevaluates, negotiates, structures, closes and monitors our investments. We depend on the diligence, skill, investment expertise and\nnetwork of business contacts of RCM’s investment professionals, and the Investment Committee to source appropriate investments for\nus. We also depend on members of RCM’s investment team and the Investment Committee to analyze potential investments for us and\nmonitor those investments, and on members of the Investment Committee to make investment decisions for us. Our future success\ndepends on the continued availability of members of RCM’s investment team and the Investment Committee and the other investment\nprofessionals available to RCM. The Corporation does not have any employment agreements with key personnel of RCM, including\nmembers of the Investment Committee, and we cannot provide any assurance that unforeseen business, medical, personal or other\ncircumstances would not lead any such individual to terminate his or her relationship with RCM. In addition, it is not expected that\nmembers of RCM's investment team and the Investment Committee will devote all of their business time to our operations and each\nsuch person will have other demands on their time as a result of their other activities. As a result, RCM may need to hire, train,\nsupervise and manage new investment professionals to participate in our investment selection and monitoring process and may not be\nable to find investment professionals in a timely manner or at all. The loss of a material number of investment professionals to which\nRCM has access or members of the Investment Committee, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our\ninvestment objectives as well as on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial results will depend on RCM’s skill to manage and deploy capital effectively.\nOur ability to achieve long-term capital appreciation on our equity investments and to maintain a current cash flow from our\ndebt investments while shifting our portfolio to contain a greater percentage of interest-yielding debt securities depends on RCM’s\ncapability to effectively identify, invest, and manage our capital.\nAccomplishing this investment objective effectively and on a cost effective basis will be based on RCM’s handling of the\ninvestment process, starting with its ability to find investments that offer favorable terms and meet our investment objective, and its\nability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us. RCM will also need to monitor our portfolio companies’\nperformance and may be called upon to provide managerial assistance. These competing demands on their time may slow the rate of\ninvestment or the effective deployment of capital.\nEven if RCM is able to grow and build on our investment portfolio, any failure by RCM to manage the growth of our\nportfolio effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If\nRCM cannot successfully manage our investment portfolio or implement our investment objectives, this could negatively impact our\nresults of operation and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks created by our highly regulated environment.\nWe are regulated by the SEC as a BDC and subject to the requirements applicable to BDCs under the 1940 Act. The 1940\nAct imposes numerous constraints on the operations of BDCs and their external advisers. Changes in the laws or regulations that\ngovern BDCs could significantly affect our business. Regulations and laws may be changed periodically, and the interpretations of\n14\nthe relevant regulations and laws are also subject to change. Any change in the regulations and laws governing our business could\nhave a material impact on our financial condition and our results of operations. Moreover, the laws and regulations that govern BDCs\nmay place conflicting demands on the manner in which we operate, and the resolution of those conflicts may restrict or otherwise\nadversely affect our operations. Furthermore, any failure to comply with the requirements imposed on BDCs by the 1940 Act could\ncause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us and/or expose us to claims of private litigants.\nThe 1940 Act permits us to issue senior securities, which include borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions,\nin amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities,\nsubject to certain disclosure requirements. On January 24, 2024, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in\nSection 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section\n61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act. Therefore, the Company’s asset coverage\nrequirements for senior securities will automatically be changed from 200% to 150%, effective January 24, 2025. If our asset coverage\nis not at least 200% or, beginning January 24, 2025, at least 150%, we are not permitted to pay distributions or issue additional senior\nsecurities. As a result and if we are unable to comply with our asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act, we could have\ndifficulty meeting the distribution requirements necessary to maintain RIC tax treatment. Moreover, if the value of our assets declines,\nwe may also be unable to satisfy this asset coverage test. If that happens, we may be required to liquidate a portion of our investments\nand repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when we may be unable to do so or unable to do so on favorable terms.\nWe are subject to risks created by the valuation of our portfolio investments.\nAt December 31, 2023, 91% of our investments are in private securities that are not publicly traded. There is typically no\npublic market for securities of the small privately held companies in which we typically invest. Investments are valued on a quarterly\nbasis in accordance with our established valuation policy and are stated at fair value and approved by our Board. The inputs into the\ndetermination of fair value of these investments may require significant judgment or estimation. In the absence of a readily\nascertainable market value, the estimated value of our investment portfolio may differ significantly, favorably or unfavorably, from\nthe values that would be placed on the portfolio if a ready market for the securities existed and may fluctuate significantly over short\nperiods of time. Any changes in estimated value of our investments are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as “Net\nchange in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments.” In addition, the participation of RCM’s investment professionals in\nour valuation process may result in a conflict of interest as RCM’s Base Management Fee under the Investment Management\nAgreement is based, in part, on the value of our gross assets, and the Incentive Fees payable under the Investment Management\nAgreement are based, in part, on realized gains and realized and unrealized losses.\nRCM, acting as our investment adviser, operates in a competitive market for investment opportunities.\nRCM faces significant competition in effecting our investing activities from many entities including private venture capital\nfunds, investment affiliates of large companies, wealthy individuals and other domestic or foreign investors. The competition is not\nlimited to entities that operate in the same general geographical areas as we do. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and\nhave considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors have a lower cost\nof capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, including from the Small Business Administration. In addition,\nincreased competition for attractive investment opportunities allows debtors to demand more favorable terms and offer fewer\ncontractual protections to creditors. Some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than we do.\nThese characteristics have allowed, and could continue to allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish\nmore relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to offer. We may lose investment\nopportunities if we do not match our competitors’ pricing, terms and structure. If we choose to match our competitors’ pricing, terms\nand structure, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. As a\nregulated BDC, we are also required to disclose quarterly and annually the name and business description of our portfolio companies\nand the value of their portfolio securities. Most of our competitors are not subject to this public disclosure requirement or similar\ntypes of disclosure requirements. This obligation to disclose this information could hinder RCM’s ability to invest in potential\nportfolio companies on our behalf. Additionally, other regulations, current and future, may make us less attractive as a potential\ninvestor to a given portfolio company than a private fund that is not subject to these regulations.\nThere are potential conflicts of interest, including the management of other investment funds and accounts by the principals\nand certain members of the Investment Committee of RCM, which could impact our investment returns.\nThe principals and certain members of the Investment Committee of RCM manage other funds and accounts, including for\nentities affiliated with members of the Investment Committee. Accordingly, they have obligations to those investors, the fulfillment of\nwhich may not be in the best interests of, or may be adverse to the interests of, us or our shareholders. Although the principals,\nmembers of the Investment Committee and other professional staff of RCM are expected to devote as much time to our management\nas appropriate to enable RCM to perform its duties in accordance with the Investment Management Agreement, the members of the\n15\nInvestment Committee and investment professionals of RCM may have conflicts in allocating their time and services among RCM, on\nthe one hand, and the other managed investment vehicles, on the other hand.\nRCM, including members of its Investment Committee, may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us\nand other investment vehicles affiliated with members of the Investment Committee that have overlapping investment objectives with\nours. Although RCM, including members of the Investment Committee, and its affiliates that manage other investment portfolios will\nendeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner in accordance with its written allocation policies and\nprocedures, it is possible that, in the future, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in investments made by investment\nfunds managed by RCM or members of the Investment Committee given the requirements or application of such allocation policies\nand procedures or if such investment is prohibited by laws that are applicable to us.\nRCM and its affiliates, including some of our officers and directors, face conflicts of interest caused by compensation\narrangements with us, which could result in actions that are not in the best interests of our shareholders.\nRCM and its affiliates receive fees from us in return for their services, including certain incentive fees based on the\nperformance of our investments. These fees could influence the advice provided to us. Generally, the greater the risk assumed by us\nwith respect to our investments, the greater the potential for growth in our assets and profits, and, correlatively, the fees payable by us\nto RCM under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement. These compensation arrangements could affect RCM or its\naffiliates’ judgment with respect to investments made by us, which allows RCM to earn increased asset management fees.\nOur ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted.\nWe are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of our affiliates without the prior\napproval of the “required majority” of our directors as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act and, in some cases, the SEC. Any\nperson that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities will be our affiliate for purposes of the 1940\nAct, and we will generally be prohibited from buying from, or selling to, such affiliate any securities, absent the prior approval of the\n“required majority” of our directors as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain “joint”\ntransactions with certain of our affiliates, including other funds or clients advised by RCM or its affiliates, which in certain\ncircumstances could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times to the extent the\ntransaction involves a joint investment), without prior approval of our Board and, in some cases, the SEC. If a person acquires more\nthan 25% of our voting securities, or is otherwise deemed to control, be controlled by, or be under common control with us, we will be\nprohibited from buying from, or selling to, such person or certain of that person’s affiliates any securities, or entering into prohibited\njoint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. For example, given East’s approximately 64% ownership\nposition in our common stock, this prohibition impacts our ability to participate in certain transactions or investments where East is\ninvolved, including with respect to certain of the loans and other securities that were contributed to us by East as part of the\nconsideration for East’s purchase of our common stock in the Transaction, to the extent such loans and other securities are also held\nby East or another one of our affiliates. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their\naffiliates or anyone who is under common control with us. As a result of these restrictions, we may also be prohibited from buying\nsecurities from, or selling securities to, any portfolio company that is controlled by a fund managed by either RCM or its affiliates\nwithout the prior approval of the SEC, which may limit the scope of investment or disposition opportunities that would otherwise be\navailable to us. The analysis of whether a particular transaction constitutes a joint transaction requires a review of the relevant facts\nand circumstances then existing.\nOn October 7, 2020, we, RCM and certain of our affiliates received the Order from the SEC to permit us to co-invest in\nportfolio companies with certain other affiliates, including other BDCs and registered investment companies, managed by RCM and\ncertain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, subject to compliance with certain conditions. On March\n29, 2021, the SEC granted us, RCM, Callodine, and certain of their affiliates the New Order that superseded the Order and permits us\nto co-invest with affiliates managed by RCM and Callodine. The New Order was sought in connection with the completion of the\nAdviser Change of Control. After the Adviser Change of Control, Callodine held a controlling interest in RCM. Pursuant to the New\nOrder, we generally are permitted to co-invest with affiliates covered by the New Order if a “required majority” (as defined in Section\n57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction,\nincluding that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders\nand do not involve overreaching of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with\nthe interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, and (3) the investment by our affiliates\nwould not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our\naffiliates are investing. In addition, on September 6, 2022, the SEC granted an amendment to the New Order to permit us to participate\nin follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds (as defined in the New Order) that do not\nhold any investments in such existing portfolio companies.\n16\nIn situations when co-investment with funds managed by RCM or its affiliates is not permitted under the 1940 Act and\nrelated rules, existing or future staff guidance, or the terms and conditions of the exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, RCM and\nits affiliates will need to decide which client or clients (including us) will proceed with the investment. Generally, we will not be\nentitled to make a co-investment in these circumstances and, to the extent that a client (other than us) is granted the opportunity to\nproceed with the investment, we will not be permitted to participate in the investment we otherwise may have made.\nRCM may be paid incentive compensation even if we incur a net loss, and we cannot recover any portion of the incentive fee\npreviously paid.\nRCM is entitled to incentive compensation under our Investment Management Agreement for each fiscal quarter under the\nIncome Based Fee in an amount equal to a percentage of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to a hurdle rate, a catch-\nup provision, a cap and a deferral mechanism. For purposes of calculating the Income Based Fee, our pre-incentive fee net investment\nincome excludes realized and unrealized capital losses that we may incur in the fiscal quarter, even if such capital losses result in a net\nloss for that quarter. Thus, we may be required to pay RCM incentive compensation under the Income Based Fee for a fiscal quarter\neven if we incur a net loss for that quarter. In addition, if we pay the Capital Gains Fee and thereafter experience additional realized\ncapital losses or unrealized capital losses, we will not be able to recover any portion of the incentive fee previously paid.\nRCM’s liability is limited under the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement, and we are\nrequired to indemnify RCM against certain liabilities, which may lead RCM to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it\nwould when acting for its own account.\nUnder the Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement, RCM does not assume any responsibility\nto us other than to render the services described in the Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement, as\napplicable, and it is not responsible for any action of our Board in declining to follow RCM’s advice or recommendations. Pursuant to\nthe Investment Management Agreement and the Administration Agreement, RCM, its members and their respective officers,\nmanagers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person affiliated with any of them are not liable to\nus for their acts under the Investment Management Agreement and Administration Agreement, as applicable, absent willful\nmisfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties. We have agreed to indemnify, defend\nand protect RCM, its members and their respective officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons and any other\nperson affiliated with any of them with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or otherwise based upon\nthe performance of any of RCM’s duties or obligations under the Investment Management Agreement or Administration Agreement,\nas applicable, or otherwise as investment adviser or administrator, as applicable, for us, and not arising out of willful misfeasance, bad\nfaith, gross negligence or reckless disregard in the performance of their duties under the Investment Management Agreement or the\nAdministration Agreement. These protections may lead RCM to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when\nacting for its own account.\nOur investment adviser and administrator, RCM, has the right to resign on 60 days’ written notice, and we may not be able to\nfind a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our\nfinancial condition, business and results of operations.\nOur investment adviser and administrator, RCM, has the right, under both the Investment Management Agreement and the\nAdministration Agreement, to resign at any time upon not less than 60 days’ written notice, whether we have found a replacement or\nnot. If RCM resigns, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or administrator or hire internal management with similar\nexpertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so\nquickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations are likely to be\nadversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline. Even if we are able to retain comparable management,\nwhether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objectives may\nresult in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nIf we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to maintain our qualification as a BDC or\nbe precluded from investing according to our current business strategy.\nAs a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such\nacquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets.\nWe believe that most of the investments that we may acquire in the future will constitute qualifying assets. However, we may\nbe precluded from investing in what we believe to be attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes\nof the 1940 Act. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could violate the 1940 Act provisions\napplicable to BDCs. As a result of such violation, specific rules under the 1940 Act could prevent us, for example, from making\n17\nfollow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to\ndispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to come into compliance with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such\ninvestments quickly, it could be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. We may not be able to find a buyer for\nsuch investments and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss. Any such outcomes could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not maintain our status as a BDC, we would be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company\nunder the 1940 Act. As a registered closed-end investment company, we would be subject to substantially more regulatory restrictions\nunder the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease our operating flexibility.\nThe fee structure under the Investment Management Agreement may induce RCM to pursue investments and incur leverage,\nwhich may not be in the best interests of the shareholders.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Base Management Fee is payable even if the value of our\ninvestment portfolio declines. The Base Management Fee is calculated based on the total assets (other than cash or cash equivalents\nbut including assets purchased with borrowed funds), as determined according to procedures duly adopted by the Board. Accordingly,\nthe Base Management Fee is payable regardless of whether the value of Rand’s total assets or investment portfolio has decreased\nduring the then-current quarter and creates an incentive for RCM to incur leverage, such as borrowings under our Credit Facility,\nwhich may not be consistent with our shareholders’ interests.\nThe Incentive Fee payable to RCM is calculated based on a percentage of our return on invested capital. The terms of the\nIncentive Fee calculation may create an incentive for RCM to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than\nwould be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. Unlike the Base Management Fee, the Income Based Fee is\npayable only if the hurdle rate is achieved. Because the portfolio earns investment income on gross assets while the hurdle rate is\nbased on net assets, and because the use of leverage, such as borrowings under our Credit Facility, increases gross assets without any\ncorresponding increase in net assets, RCM may be incentivized to incur leverage to grow the portfolio, which will tend to enhance\nreturns where our portfolio has positive returns and increase the chances that the hurdle rate is achieved. Conversely, the use of\nleverage may increase losses where our portfolio has negative returns, which would impair the value of our common stock.\nIn addition, RCM receives the Incentive Fees based, in part, upon net capital gains realized on our investments under the\nCapital Gains Fee. Unlike the Income Based Fee, there is no hurdle rate applicable to the Capital Gains Fee. As a result, RCM may\nhave an incentive to invest more capital in investments that are likely to result in capital gains as compared to income producing\nsecurities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative equity securities than would otherwise be the case, which\ncould result in higher investment losses, particularly during economic downturns.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to grow.\nWe may need additional capital to fund new investments and grow. We may access the capital markets periodically to issue\nequity securities as a means to raise additional capital. Pursuant to the restrictions of the 1940 Act, we are not generally able to issue\nand sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock at a price below the\nthen-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in the best interests of the Corporation and\nour shareholders, and our shareholders also approve the sale, giving us the authority to do so. Although we currently do not have such\nauthorization, we may seek such authorization in the future.\nIn addition to amounts available to be borrowed under our Credit Facility, we may also issue debt securities or borrow\nadditional amounts from financial institutions in order to obtain such additional capital, up to the maximum amount permitted by the\n1940 Act. The 1940 Act permits us to issue debt securities or incur indebtedness only in amounts such that our asset coverage, as\ndefined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200%, or beginning after January 24, 2025, at least 150%, immediately after such issuance or\nincurrence. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs and limit our access to the capital markets or result in a\ndecision by lenders not to extend credit to us. Furthermore, the debt capital that may be available to us in the future, if any is available\nat all, may be at a higher costs and on less favorable terms and conditions. A reduction in the availability of new capital could limit\nour ability to grow. In addition, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains\nin excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our shareholders to maintain our RIC election. As a result, our earnings may not be\nable to be retained by the Corporation to fund new investments and, instead, may need to be distributed to shareholders.\nIf we are unable to access the capital markets or if we are unable to borrow from financial institutions, we may be unable to\ngrow our business and execute our business strategy fully, and our earnings, if any, could decrease, which could have an adverse\neffect on the value of our common stock.\n18\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and incidents that may adversely affect our operations, the operations of RCM or the\ncompanies in which we invest. A failure in our, or RCM’s, cybersecurity systems could impair our ability to conduct business\nand damage our business relationships, compromise or corrupt our confidential information and ultimately negatively impact\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.\nOur and RCM’s operations are dependent on secure information technology systems for data processing, storage and\nreporting. Increased cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-attacks pose a risk to the security\nof our and RCM’s information and the information of our portfolio companies. Like other companies, we or RCM may experience\nthreats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. If\none or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information stored in, or\ntransmitted through, our or RCM’s computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or RCM’s\noperations, which could result in damage to our or RCM’s reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs or regulatory\npenalties. Furthermore, if one of these events were to occur at one of our portfolio companies, it could impact their business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, which could negatively impact our investment. In addition, these cyber-attacks could affect our\nand RCM’s computer network, our website or our other service providers (such as, but not limited to, accountants, lawyers, and\ntransfer agents) and could result in operating disruptions or information misappropriation, which could have a material adverse effect\non our business operations and the integrity and availability of our financial information. We and RCM have attempted to mitigate\nthese cybersecurity risks by employing a number of processes, procedures and internal controls within our organization and RCM, but\nwe remain potentially vulnerable to additional known and unknown threats.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results.\nWe could experience fluctuations in our annual and quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, some of which are\nbeyond our control, including RCM’s ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, RCM’s\ntransition of our portfolio to include more interest-yielding securities, the interest rate payable on the debt securities acquired and the\ndefault rate on such securities, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized\ngains or losses and the timing of RCM’s decision to exit from certain of our investments, the degree to which we encounter\ncompetition in the markets in which we operate and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period\nshould not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future quarters or any future fiscal years.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nOur business and the businesses of our portfolio companies are facing increasing public scrutiny related to environmental,\nsocial and governance (“ESG”) activities. We risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in several areas, such as\ndiversity, equity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency,\nand having RCM consider ESG factors in their investment processes on our behalf. Failure to act responsibly with respect to ESG\nactivities could negatively impact our reputation, our relationship with existing and future portfolio companies, and our relationships\nwith our investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, new regulatory initiatives\nrelated to ESG could adversely affect our business and the businesses of our portfolio companies. New laws and regulations increase\nour regulatory burden and could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we or our portfolio\ncompanies conduct our businesses and adversely affect our results of operation.\nRisks related to our Investments\nWe have a limited number of companies in our portfolio of investments and may be subjected to greater risk if any of these\ncompanies default.\nOur portfolio investment values are concentrated in a small number of companies and as such, we may experience a\nsignificant loss in our net asset value if one or more of these companies performs poorly or goes out of business. The unrealized or\nrealized depreciation in the value of the securities of any one of these companies would negatively impact our net asset value.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.\nRCM, on our behalf, invests, and we expect that RCM will continue, on our behalf, to invest, primarily in portfolio\ncompanies whose securities are not publicly traded and may be subject to restrictions on resale, and as a result will be less liquid than\npublicly traded securities. Most of our investments are or will be either equity securities or debt securities acquired directly from\nsmall, private companies. The illiquidity of most of our portfolio may adversely affect our ability to dispose of the securities at times\nwhen it may be advantageous for us to liquidate investments. In addition, we may not realize the full value of these private\ninvestments if we have to liquidate all or a part of our portfolio investment quickly, given the lack of available markets for their sale.\n19\nEconomic downturns or recessions may adversely affect our portfolio companies’ financial performance and therefore harm\nour operating results.\nThe United States economy has periodically experienced periods of instability and recessions, including as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and the financial results of the small companies in which we invest could be more acutely affected negatively\nby this instability and suffer deterioration in operational or financial results. This deterioration may have a negative effect on our\nfinancial performance.\nInvesting in private companies involves a high degree of risk.\nWe typically invest a substantial portion of our assets in small private companies. These private businesses may be thinly\ncapitalized, unproven companies with risky technologies, products or services, may lack management depth, and may not have\nattained profitability. Because of the speculative nature and the lack of a public market for these investments, there is significantly\ngreater risk of loss than is the case with securities traded on a public exchange. We expect that some of our investments will become\nworthless and that some will appear likely to become successful but will never realize their potential. We have historically been risk\nseeking rather than risk averse in our approach to our investments. Given the incentive compensation components of our arrangement\nwith RCM under the Investment Management Agreement, RCM may have similar incentives to be risk seeking rather than risk averse\nin making its investment decisions on our behalf.\nEven if our portfolio companies are able to develop commercially viable technologies, products or services, the market for\nthose new technologies, products and services is likely to be highly competitive and rapidly changing. Commercial success is difficult\nto predict and the marketing and other efforts of our portfolio companies may not be successful.\nAny unrealized losses we experience in our portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our\nincome available for distribution.\nAs a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Decreases in the\nfair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized losses in our portfolio of debt investments\ncould be an indication of a portfolio company’s inability to meet its debt repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected\ninvestments. Any unrealized losses in our portfolio of equity investments could be an indication of operating or other problems at a\nportfolio company and the possibility that this investment may become worthless in the future. In either such case, this could result in\nrealized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods.\nWe may be subject to risks associated with our origination of, or investment in, covenant-lite loans to our portfolio companies.\nWe have originated or invested in, and may in the future originate or invest in, covenant-lite loans to our portfolio companies,\nwhich means the loan agreement or other debt instrument governing these debt obligations contains fewer maintenance covenants than\nother loan agreements or debt obligations, or no maintenance covenants, and may not include covenants that we could use to monitor\nthe financial performance of the portfolio company borrower, including covenants based upon compliance with financial ratios, and\ndeclare a default under the loan agreement or other debt instrument if the specified covenants are breached. While these loans or other\ndebt obligations to portfolio company borrowers may still contain other collateral protections, a covenant-lite loan may carry more\nrisk than a covenant-heavy loan made to the same portfolio company borrower as it does not require this borrower to provide\naffirmation that certain specific financial tests have been satisfied on a routine basis, as is generally required under a covenant-heavy\nloan agreement or other debt instrument. Generally, covenant-lite loans or other debt instruments provide borrowers more freedom,\nwhich may negatively impact lenders because these covenants, if any, tend to be incurrence-based, meaning they are only tested and\ncan only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by deterioration in the borrower’s financial\ncondition. Should the financial condition of a portfolio company borrower begin to deteriorate, our investment in or origination of\ncovenant-lite loans or other debt instruments to such portfolio company borrower may potentially reduce our ability to restructure such\nproblematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result of our investment in or origination of covenant-lite loans, our exposure to\nlosses may be increased, which could result in an adverse impact on the Corporation’s revenues, net income and NAV per share.\nWe provide debt and equity capital primarily to small companies, which may present a greater risk of loss than providing debt\nand equity capital to larger companies.\nOur portfolio consists primarily of debt and equity investments in small companies. Compared to larger companies, small\ncompanies generally have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may be in a weaker financial position and may need\nmore capital to expand, compete and operate their business. They also typically have fewer administrative resources, which can lead to\ngreater uncertainty in their ability to generate accurate and reliable financial data, including their ability to deliver audited financial\nstatements. In addition, many small companies may be unable to obtain financing from the public capital markets or other traditional\n20\nsources, such as commercial banks, in part because loans made to these types of companies entail higher risks than loans made to\ncompanies that have larger businesses, greater financial resources or are otherwise able to access traditional credit sources on more\nattractive terms.\nA variety of factors may affect the ability of borrowers to make scheduled payments on debt securities or loans, including\nfailure to satisfy financial targets and covenants, a downturn in a borrower’s industry or changes in the economy in general. In\naddition, investing in small companies in general involves a number of significant risks, including that small companies:\n• may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold,\nwhich may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing\nany guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;\n• typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which\ntend to render small companies more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and market conditions, as well as general economic\ndownturns;\n• are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability,\nresignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company\nand, in turn, on us;\n• generally have less predictable operating results, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a\nsubstantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion\nor maintain their competitive position;\n• may from time to time be parties to litigation;\n• may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which may limit their ability to grow or to\nrepay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity; and\n• may be particularly vulnerable to changes in customer preferences and market conditions, depend on a limited number of\ncustomers, and face intense competition, including from companies with greater financial, technical, managerial and\nmarketing resources.\nAny of these factors or changes thereto could impair a small company’s financial condition, results of operation, cash flow or\nresult in other adverse events, such as bankruptcy, any of which could limit a borrower’s ability to make scheduled payments on our\ndebt securities. This, in turn, could result in losses in our investments and a decrease in our net interest income and NAV per share.\nWe may have limited access to information about privately held companies in which we invest.\nWe invest primarily in privately held companies. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we\nare required to rely on the ability of RCM’s investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns\nfrom investing in these companies. These companies and their financial information are not subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nand other rules that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, RCM may\nnot make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investment.\nPrepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce\nour returns on equity.\nWe are subject to the risk that investments intended to be held over long periods are, instead, repaid prior to maturity. When\nthis occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments that will typically have substantially lower yields than\nthe debt being prepaid or repay outstanding borrowings under our Credit Facility that has a lower interest rate than the yield of the\ndebt being prepaid, and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment may also be at\nlower yields or on less favorable terms than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially\nadversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elects to prepay amounts owed by them. Additionally, prepayments\ncould negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equal with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.\nWe invest primarily in debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. In some cases portfolio companies are permitted to\nhave other debt that ranks equal with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may\nprovide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled\nto receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution,\n21\nreorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio\ncompany would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After\nrepaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In\nthe case of debt ranking equal with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with\nother creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio\ncompany.\nThere may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be\nsubject to lender liability claims.\nEven though we may have structured certain of our investments as senior loans, if one of our portfolio companies were to go\nbankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the size of our investment and the extent to which we actually provided\nmanagerial assistance to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a\nportion of our claim to that of other creditors. In addition, lenders can be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by them\nwhere they become too involved in the borrower’s business or exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become\nsubject to a lender’s liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance.\nWe generally do not control our portfolio companies.\nWe do not have an expectation to control the decision making in our portfolio companies, even though we may have a board\nseat or board observation rights. Because of this, we are subject to the risk that our portfolio companies will make business decisions\nwith which we disagree or will incur risks or otherwise act in ways that do not maximize their value and serve our interests as minority\ndebt and equity holders. Due to the lack of liquidity in our investments in these private companies, we may not be able to dispose of\nour investment in these portfolio companies as freely as we would like or at a valuation that we believe is appropriate. As a result, a\nportfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings.\nWe typically are a minority shareholder in our portfolio companies in which we have made equity investments.\nIn connection with equity investments, we typically invest as a minority shareholder in our portfolio companies. As a\nminority shareholder, we are unable to require the company to seek or entertain liquidity events as a way to exit our investments. This\nmay cause us to hold equity investments longer than planned or to seek a sale that may not reflect the full value of our equity\ninvestment.\nWe may not have the funds or ability to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies.\nWe may not have the funds or ability to make additional investments in our portfolio companies. After our initial investment\nin a company, we may be asked to participate in another round of financing by the company. There is no assurance that we will make,\nhave sufficient funds to make or be permitted to make under the 1940 Act, these follow-on investments. Any decision to not make an\nadditional investment in a portfolio company may have a negative impact on the portfolio company in need of the capital and have a\nnegative impact on our investment in the company.\nRisks related to our Indebtedness\nWe borrow money, which magnifies the potential for loss on amounts invested and increases the risk of investing with us.\nLeverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique, and we intend to continue to borrow money as part of\nour business plan. The use of leverage magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increases the risks\nassociated with investing in us. Lenders of senior debt securities, such as under our Credit Facility, have fixed dollar claims on our\nassets that are superior to the claims of our shareholders.\nWe have outstanding existing indebtedness and, subject to the limitations imposed under our Credit Agreement, may in the\nfuture borrow additional money under our Credit Facility with M&T Bank, as lender, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on\namounts invested and may increase the risk of investing with us. Our ability to service our existing and potential future debt depends\nlargely on our financial performance, which is impacted by the financial performance of our portfolio companies, and is subject to\nprevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures.\nIf the fair value of our consolidated assets decreases while we have debt outstanding, leveraging would cause our NAV to\ndecline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. In addition, if the fair value of our consolidated assets\ndeclines substantially, we may fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios imposed upon us by the 1940 Act or our Lender. Similarly,\n22\nany decrease in our consolidated income while we have debt outstanding would cause net income to decline more sharply than it\nwould have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to pay distributions to shareholders and the price\nof our common stock.\nOn January 24, 2024, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of\nthe Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as\namended by the Small Business Credit Availability Act (“SBCAA”). Therefore, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior\nsecurities will automatically be changed from 200% to 150%, effective January 24, 2025. As a result, if we comply with certain\ndisclosure requirements, we will be able to incur additional indebtedness, which may increase the risk of investing in us.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $16.25 million in principal amount of outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Facility,\nwhich had an annualized interest cost of 8.72%. For us to cover these annualized interest payments on indebtedness, we must achieve\nannual returns on our investments of at least 8.72%. Since we pay interest at a floating rate on our Credit Facility, an increase in\ninterest rates will generally increase our borrowing costs. We expect that our annualized interest cost and returns required to cover\ninterest will increase if we issue additional debt securities.\nIn order to assist investors in understanding the effects of leverage, the following table illustrates the effect of leverage on\nreturns from an investment in our common stock assuming our asset coverage equals (i) our actual asset coverage as of December 31,\n2023, (ii) 200% asset coverage as of December 31, 2023, and (iii) 150% asset coverage as of December 31, 2023, at various annual\nreturns, net of expenses. Leverage generally magnifies the return of shareholders when the portfolio return is positive and magnifies\ntheir losses when the portfolio return is negative. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table. The\ncalculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing below.\nEffects of Leverage Based on Actual Amount of Borrowings Incurred by us as of December 31, 2023\nAssumed Return on Our Portfolio (net of expenses) (1)\n-10% -5% 0% 5% 10% 15%\nCorresponding return to a shareholder\nassuming actual asset coverage as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (2) -15.7% -9.0% -2.3% 4.3% 11.0% 17.7%\nCorresponding return to a shareholder\nassuming 200% asset coverage as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (3) -28.7% -18.7% -8.7% 1.3% 11.3% 21.3%\nCorresponding return to a shareholder\nassuming 150% asset coverage as of\nDecember 31, 2023 (4) -47.4% -32.4% -17.4% -2.4% 12.6% 27.6%\n(1) The assumed portfolio return is required by SEC regulations and is not a prediction of, and does not represent, our\nprojected or actual performance. Actual returns may be greater or less than those appearing in the table. Pursuant to SEC regulations,\nthis table is calculated as of December 31, 2023. As a result, it has not been updated to take into account any changes in assets or\nleverage since December 31, 2023.\n(2) In order to compute the “Corresponding return to a shareholder assuming actual asset coverage as of December 31,\n2023,” the “Assumed Return on Our Portfolio” is multiplied by the total value of our assets at December 31, 2023 to obtain an\nassumed return to us. From this amount, the interest expense (calculated by multiplying the weighted average stated interest rate of\n8.72% by the approximately $16.25 million of principal debt outstanding as of December 31, 2023) is subtracted to determine the\nreturn available to shareholders. The return available to shareholders is then divided by the total value of our net assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 to determine the “Corresponding return to a shareholder assuming actual asset coverage as of December 31,\n2023.”\n(3) In order to compute the “Corresponding return to a shareholder assuming 200% asset coverage as of December 31,\n2023,” the “Assumed Return on Our Portfolio” is multiplied by the total value of our assets at December 31, 2023 to obtain an\nassumed return to us. From this amount, the interest expense (calculated by multiplying the weighted average stated interest rate of\n8.72% by the approximately $41 million of principal debt outstanding, assuming 200% asset coverage) is subtracted to determine the\nreturn available to shareholders. The return available to shareholders is then divided by the total value of our net assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023, assuming 200% asset coverage to determine the “Corresponding return to a shareholder assuming 200% asset\ncoverage as of December 31, 2023.”\n23\n(4) In order to compute the “Corresponding return to a shareholder assuming 150% asset coverage as of December 31,\n2023,” the “Assumed Return on Our Portfolio” is multiplied by the total value of our assets at December 31, 2023 to obtain an\nassumed return to us. From this amount, the interest expense (calculated by multiplying the weighted average stated interest rate of\n8.72% by the approximately $54 million of principal debt outstanding, assuming 150% asset coverage) is subtracted to determine the\nreturn available to shareholders. The return available to shareholders is then divided by the total value of our net assets as of\nDecember 31, 2023, assuming 150% asset coverage to determine the “Corresponding return to a shareholder assuming 150% asset\ncoverage as of December 31, 2023.”\nBecause we often borrow money to make our investments, if market interest rates continue to increase, our cost of capital\nunder our Credit Facility is likely to also increase, which could reduce our net investment income.\nBecause we often borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference\nbetween the rate at which we borrow funds under our Credit Facility (which is variable rate indebtedness) to make an investment and\nthe rate at which we invest those funds (which, with respect to our debt investments, is fixed rate indebtedness). When interest rates\nincrease, our debt service obligations under our Credit Facility increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same. As a\nresult, an increase in market interest rates, as has occurred in the recent past, may have an adverse effect on our net investment income\nin the event we use debt to finance our investments and those debt investments carry a fixed interest rate. In periods of rising interest\nrates, our cost of funds would increase with respect to amounts borrowed under our Credit Facility, but the interest income received\nfrom our portfolio companies under our fixed interest rate debt investments will remain constant, which has reduced, and could in the\nfuture continue to reduce, our net investment income.\nLegislation allows us to incur additional leverage.\nUnder the 1940 Act, a BDC generally is not permitted to incur borrowings, issue debt securities or issue preferred stock\nunless immediately after the borrowing or issuance the ratio of total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness) to total\nindebtedness plus preferred stock is at least 200%. However, under the SBCAA, which became law in March 2018, BDCs have the\nability to elect to become subject to a lower asset coverage requirement of 150%, subject to the receipt of the requisite board or\nshareholder approvals under the SBCAA and satisfaction of certain other conditions.\nOn January 24, 2024, the Board, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of\nthe Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, as\namended by the SBCAA. Therefore, the Company’s asset coverage requirements for senior securities will automatically be changed\nfrom 200% to 150%, effective January 24, 2025. Pursuant to Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act, as amended by the SBCAA, we will be\npermitted to potentially increase our maximum debt-to-equity ratio from an effective level of one-to-one to two-to-one.\nAs a result, you may face increased investment risk. We may not be able to implement our strategy to utilize additional\nleverage successfully.\nProvisions in our Credit Facility or any other future borrowing facility limit our discretion in operating our business.\nThe Credit Facility is, and any future borrowing facility may be, backed by all of our portfolio company investments on\nwhich the lenders will or, in the case of a future facility, may have a security interest. We expect that any security interests we grant\nwill be set forth in a pledge and security agreement and evidenced by the filing of financing statements by the agent for the lenders. If\nwe were to default under the terms of any debt instrument, including under the Credit Facility, the agent for the lenders would be able\nto assume control of the timing of disposition of any or all of our assets securing such debt, which would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, any security interests as well as negative covenants under the Credit Facility or any other borrowing facility may\nlimit our ability to create liens on assets to secure additional debt and may make it difficult for us to restructure or refinance\nindebtedness at or prior to maturity or obtain additional debt or equity financing. In addition, if our borrowing base under the Credit\nFacility or any other borrowing facility were to decrease, we would be required to secure additional assets in an amount equal to any\nborrowing base deficiency. In the event that all of our assets are secured at the time of such a borrowing base deficiency, we could be\nrequired to repay advances under the Credit Facility or any other borrowing facility, which could have a material adverse impact on\nour ability to fund future investments and to make distributions to shareholders.\nAn event of default under the Credit Facility or any other borrowing facility could result in an accelerated maturity date for\nall amounts outstanding thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. This could\nreduce our liquidity and cash flows and impair our ability to grow our business and maintain our qualification as a RIC.\n24\nRisks related to our Common Stock\nEast exercises significant influence over us in connection with its ownership of our common stock.\nEast beneficially owns approximately 64% of Rand’s outstanding common stock. As a result, East is able to direct the\noutcome of any matters submitted for shareholder action, including approval of significant corporate transactions, such as amendments\nto our governing documents, business combinations, consolidations, and mergers. East has substantial influence on us and could\nexercise its influence in a manner that conflicts with the interests of other shareholders. The presence of a significant shareholder may\nalso have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or for the Board to discourage a third party from seeking\nto acquire us.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has the right to designate two or three persons,\ndepending upon the size of the Board, for nomination for election to the Board. East has the right to designate (i) up to two persons if\nthe size of the Board is composed of fewer than seven directors; or (ii) up to three persons if the size of the Board is composed of\nseven or more directors. Under the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has designated Adam S. Gusky and Benjamin E. Godley\nfor nomination for election to the Board. The designation right provided to East under the terms of the Shareholder Agreement\nprovides East with a significant presence on the Board and direct influence on matters presented to the Board, although all directors,\nwhether or not nominated by East, owe fiduciary duties to all shareholders.\nOur shares often trade at a discount to our net asset value.\nShares of business development companies may trade at a market price that is less than the net asset value that is attributable\nto those shares and our shares have often traded at such a discount. Our common stock has continued to trade below our net asset\nvalue per share during historical periods and may continue this trend of trading below our net asset value per share during future\nperiods. This characteristic of closed-end investment companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share\nmay decline. It is not possible to predict if, or when, our shares will trade at, above, or below net asset value.\nInvesting in our shares may be inappropriate for an investor's risk tolerance.\nOur investments, in accordance with our investment objective and principal strategies, result in a greater than average amount\nof risk and volatility and may result in loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies are often highly speculative and\naggressive and, therefore, an investment in our shares may not be suitable for investors for whom such risk is inappropriate. Neither\nour investments nor an investment in our shares constitutes a balanced investment program.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of such securities for sale, could adversely affect the\nprevailing market prices for our common stock.\nRisks related to U.S. Federal Income Tax\nIn connection with our RIC election, we may not be able to pay distributions to our shareholders, our distributions may not\ngrow over time and a portion of our distributions may be a return of capital.\nIn connection with our RIC election, we intend to continue to pay distributions in the form of cash dividends to our\nshareholders out of assets legally available for distribution. However, we cannot assure shareholders that we will achieve investment\nresults that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or results in year over year increases in cash distribution\namounts. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by, among other things, the impact of one or more of the risk\nfactors described herein. In addition, the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC can limit our ability to\npay distributions. All distributions will be paid at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our earnings, our financial condition,\nmaintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and state corporate law requirements and such other\nfactors as our Board may deem relevant from time to time. We cannot assure shareholders that we will pay distributions on our\ncommon stock in the future.\nWhen we make distributions, we are required to determine the extent to which such distributions are paid out of current or\naccumulated earnings and profits. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a non-\ntaxable return of capital to the extent of an investor’s basis in our stock and, assuming that an investor holds our stock as a capital\nasset, thereafter as a capital gain. Generally, a non-taxable return of capital will reduce an investor’s basis in our stock for federal tax\n25\npurposes, which will result in higher tax liability when the stock is sold. Shareholders should read any written disclosure\naccompanying a distribution carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nIn connection with our RIC Election, we will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to satisfy certain RIC\nqualification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code or do not satisfy the annual distribution requirement.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain RIC status, and we will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal\nincome tax if we are unable to maintain qualification as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to satisfy the requirements\nfor RIC tax treatment, we must meet the following annual distribution, income source and asset diversification requirements to be\nrelieved of federal taxes on income and gains distributed to our shareholders.\n• The annual distribution requirement for a RIC will be satisfied if we distribute to our shareholders on an annual basis at least\n90% of our net ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if\nany. If we are unable to obtain cash from sources in order to make these distributions, we could fail to qualify for RIC tax\ntreatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax.\n• The income source requirement will only be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our income for each year from dividends,\ninterest, gains from the sale of stock or securities or similar sources.\n• The asset diversification requirement will only be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of\neach quarter of our taxable year. To satisfy this requirement, at least 50% of the value of our assets must consist of cash, cash\nequivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies, and investments in other\nsecurities that, with respect to one issuer, do not represent more than 5% of our total assets or 10% of the voting securities of\nthe issuer; and no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government\nsecurities or securities of other regulated investment companies, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as\ndetermined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of\ncertain “qualified publicly traded partnerships.” Failure to meet these requirements may result in our having to dispose of\ncertain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of regulated investment company status. Because most of our\ninvestments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at\ndisadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses.\nIf we fail to satisfy certain RIC qualification requirements under Subchapter M of the Code or to meet the annual distribution\nrequirement for any reason and are subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially\nreduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions, if any. Such a failure would\nhave a material adverse effect on us and our shareholders.\nIn connection with our RIC Election, we may have difficulty paying required distributions to shareholders if we recognize\nincome before or without receiving cash representing such income.\nIn connection with our RIC Election, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized\nnet short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses to maintain our eligibility for RIC tax treatment. For U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes, we include in taxable income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as contracted\npayment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term.\nThe increases in loan balances as a result of contracted PIK arrangements are included in income in advance of receiving cash\npayment and are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows. We also may be required to include in income\ncertain other amounts that we will not receive in cash.\nAny warrants that we receive in connection with our debt investments will generally be valued as part of the negotiation\nprocess with the particular portfolio company. As a result, a portion of the aggregate purchase price for the debt investments and\nwarrants will be allocated to the warrants that we receive. This will generally result in our debt instruments having original issue\ndiscount (“OID”) for tax purposes, which we must recognize as ordinary income as such original issue discount accrues regardless of\nwhether we have received any corresponding payment of such discount. Other features of debt instruments that we hold may also\ncause such instruments to generate original issue discount.\nSince in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we could have\ndifficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess\nof realized net long-term capital losses to maintain our eligibility for RIC tax treatment. Accordingly, we may have to use cash on\nhand or sell some of our assets, raise additional equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution\nrequirements. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to satisfy such distribution\nrequirements, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus may become subject to corporate-level income tax.\n26\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nAssessment, Identification and Management of Material Risks from Cybersecurity\nWe recognize the importance of maintaining cybersecurity measures to safeguard our information systems and to protect the\nconfidentiality and availability of information located on our information systems. Given this importance, we have integrated the\nconsideration of operational risks related to cybersecurity into our enterprise risk management program, which is reviewed and\nupdated annually and the results of this review are presented to the Board.\nGiven the size and scope of our operations, RCM and our officers use a third-party IT service provider to assist the\nCorporation in assessing, identifying and managing the material risks from cybersecurity threats to the Corporation and in\nadministering our IT systems. We believe that our third-party IT service provider has sufficient knowledge, experience and\ncapabilities to effectively assist the Corporation on cybersecurity matters.\nThe Corporation’s cybersecurity risk management systems processes, which are formalized in the Corporation’s\ncybersecurity risk management policy, include security controls, monitoring systems, tools and related services, and oversight from\neach of RCM, our officers and our third-party IT service provider in assessing, identifying and managing risks from cybersecurity\nthreats. The Corporation, through our third-party IT service provider, has implemented and expects to continue to implement risk-\nbased controls designed to prevent, detect and respond to information security threats. We rely on these controls to help us protect our\ninformation, our information systems, and the information of third parties who entrust us with their sensitive information.\nThe Corporation’s cybersecurity risk management policies include physical, administrative and technical safeguards, as well\nas plans and procedures designed to help the Corporation seek to prevent and effectively respond to cybersecurity threats and\nincidents, including threats or incidents that may impact us or RCM. In addition, our cybersecurity risk management programs include\nperiodic identification and testing of our vulnerabilities and cybersecurity awareness training. Finally, our Chief Compliance Officer\nconducts an annual due diligence review, including as to cybersecurity matters, of those third-party service providers that have\npossession of the Corporation’s material non-public information and reports the results of those assessments to the Board.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident impacting us, the Corporation’s cybersecurity risk management policy provides\nprocesses for responding to such an incident and facilitates coordination among the Corporation’s officers and our third-party IT\nservice provider. Depending on the nature of the incident, it may also be reported to the Board, if appropriate.\nMaterial Impact of Cybersecurity Risks\nIn the last three fiscal years, we have not experienced a material information security breach incident, and we are not aware\nof any cybersecurity risks that are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial\ncondition. However, future incidents could have a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations or financial\ncondition. For additional discussion of the risks posed by cybersecurity threats, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks related to our\nBusiness and Structure — We are subject to cybersecurity risks and incidents that may adversely affect our operations, the operations\nof RCM or the companies in which we invest. A failure in our, or RCM’s, cybersecurity systems could impair our ability to conduct\nbusiness and damage our business relationships, compromise or corrupt our confidential information and ultimately negatively impact\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results.”\nOversight of Cybersecurity Risks\nOur cybersecurity program is managed by the officers of Rand and RCM, and is primarily administered by our experienced\nthird-party IT service provider. The officers of Rand and our third-party IT service provider are in regular communications as a means\nto discuss and determine actions to be taken by the Corporation with respect to our ongoing cybersecurity risk mitigation efforts.\nThe Board, as a whole, rather than any committee of the Board, has responsibility for oversight and review of cybersecurity\nmatters with respect to the Corporation, including the risks from cybersecurity threats to the Corporation. Our Chief Compliance\nOfficer reports to the Board on a semi-annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, on cybersecurity matters and developments\napplicable to the Corporation. In addition, the Board also receives periodic reports from the Corporation’s third-party IT service\nprovider. These reports, whether from the Chief Compliance Officer or the Corporation’s third-party IT service provider, include\nupdates on the Corporation’s cybersecurity programs, the external threat environment, and the Corporation’s programs and processes\n27\nto address and mitigate the risks associated with the evolving cybersecurity threat environment. In addition, these reports also include\nupdates on the Corporation’s overall IT systems and capabilities and the Corporation’s business continuity plan that may need to be\nactivated if a material cybersecurity incident involving the Corporation were to occur. In the event of a material cybersecurity\nincident, our Chief Compliance Officer would make a report to the Board regarding the event, and the Board would engage in\noversight responsibility with respect to the Corporation’s response to such event.\nItem 2.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nShareholders of Record\nOn February 28, 2024, we had a total of approximately 1,111 shareholders, which included 49 record holders of our common\nstock, and an estimated 1,062 holders with shares beneficially owned in nominee name or under clearinghouse positions of brokerage\nfirms or banks.\nShare Price Data\nOur common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “RAND.” It is not possible to predict whether\nour common stock will trade at, above or below net asset value. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Common Stock - Our\nshares often trade at a discount to our net asset value.”\nThe following table sets forth, for each fiscal quarter for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net asset\nvalue per share of our common stock, the range of high and low closing sales prices of our common stock, the closing sales price as a\npremium (discount) to net asset value and the dividends or distributions declared by us.\nLow Sales\nHigh Sales Price\nPrice Discount Discount to Cash\nNet Asset Price Range to Net Asset Net Asset Dividend\nValue (1) High Low Value (2) Value (2) Per Share\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nFirst Quarter $ 23.23 $ 17.49 $ 13.71 (24.71)% (40.98)% $ 0.15\nSecond Quarter $ 22.34 $ 15.90 $ 14.00 (28.83)% (37.33)% $ 0.15\nThird Quarter $ 22.62 $ 18.80 $ 13.04 (16.89)% (42.35)% $ 0.15\nFourth Quarter $ 22.36 $ 16.92 $ 13.29 (24.33)% (40.56)% $ 0.38\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nFirst Quarter $ 23.00 $ 14.22 $ 13.42 (38.17)% (41.65)% $ 0.20\nSecond Quarter $ 23.79 $ 13.55 $ 12.66 (43.04)% (46.78)% $ 0.25\nThird Quarter $ 23.77 $ 13.97 $ 13.00 (41.23)% (45.31)% $ 0.25\nFourth Quarter $ 23.56 $ 14.54 $ 12.70 (38.29)% (46.10)% $ 0.63\n(1) Net asset value per share is determined as of the last day in the relevant quarter and therefore may not reflect the net asset value\nper share on the date of the high and low closing sales prices. The net asset values shown are based on outstanding shares at the\nend of the relevant quarter.\n(2) Calculated as the respective high or low closing sales price less net asset value, divided by net asset value (in each case, as of the\napplicable quarter).\nDividends\nWe have elected U.S. federal tax treatment as a RIC as of January 1, 2020 on our U.S. Federal tax return for the 2020 tax\nyear. In order to qualify as a RIC, among other things, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification\nrequirements and timely distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, as defined in\nSubchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, for each tax year. If we make the requisite distributions to our shareholders, this will\ngenerally relieve us from any requirement to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to\nour shareholders.\n29\nThe Board declared the following cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nDividend/Share\nQuarter Amount Record Date Payment Date Type\n1st $ 0.20 March 13, 2023 March 27, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n2nd $ 0.25 May 31, 2023 June 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n3rd $ 0.25 August 31, 2023 September 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.25 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.38 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Special\nShare Repurchase Program\nMaximum dollar\nTotal number of shares amount of shares that\nTotal number of purchased as part of may yet be purchased\nshares purchased Average price paid publicly under the share\nPeriod (1) per share (2) announced plan (3) repurchase program (3)\n10/1/2023 – 10/31/2023 — $ — — $ 1,500,000\n11/1/2023 – 11/30/2023 — $ — — $ 1,500,000\n12/1/2023 – 12/31/2023 — $ — — $ 1,500,000\nTotal — $ — —\n(1) There were no shares repurchased, in open market transactions, during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n(2) The average price paid per share is calculated on a settlement basis and includes commission.\n(3) On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase plan, which authorizes the Corporation to repurchase\nshares of the Corporation’s outstanding common stock with an aggregate cost of up to $1,500,000 at prices per share of common\nstock of no greater than the then current net asset value. This share repurchase authorization lasts for a period of 12 months from\nthe authorization date, until April 19, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we did not repurchase any shares of our\ncommon stock.\n30\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total shareholder returns for our common stock, the Nasdaq\nMarket Index, and the S&P BDC Index, assuming a base index of $100 at the end of 2018. The cumulative total return for each\nannual period within the five years presented is measured by dividing (1) the sum of (A) the cumulative amount of dividends for the\nmeasurement period, assuming dividend reinvestment, and (B) the difference between share prices at the end and at the beginning of\nthe measurement period by (2) the share price at the beginning of the measurement period.\nComparison of cumulative total return of one or more companies, industry indexes and/or broad markets\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\nCompany/Index/Market 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\nRand Capital Corporation $ 100.00 $ 107.32 $ 153.32 $ 151.85 $ 125.96 $ 135.35\nNASDAQ Market Index $ 100.00 $ 136.69 $ 198.10 $ 242.03 $ 163.28 $ 236.17\nS&P BDC Index $ 100.00 $ 128.17 $ 116.83 $ 160.54 $ 145.47 $ 185.58\nThe performance graph information provided above will not be deemed to be \"soliciting material\" or \"filed\" with the SEC or\nsubject to Regulations 14A or 14C, or to the liabilities of section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act, unless in the future we\nspecifically request that the information be treated as soliciting material or specifically incorporate it by reference into any filing under\nthe Securities Act of 1933, as amended or the Exchange Act.\nFees and Expenses\nThe following table is intended to assist you in understanding the fees and expenses that an investor in our common stock\nwill bear, directly or indirectly. We caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary.\nThe following table should not be considered a representation of our future expenses. Actual expenses may be greater or less than\nshown. Except where the context suggests otherwise, whenever this Form 10-K contains a reference to fees or expenses, paid by “us”\nor that “we” will pay fees or expenses, our shareholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses as investors in us.\n31\nShareholder transaction expenses (as a percentage of offering price):\nSales load — (1)\nOffering expenses — (2)\nTotal shareholder transaction expenses —\nAnnual expenses (as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock):\nBase Management Fees 1.98%(3)\nIncentive Fees 1.06%(4)\nInterest payments on borrowed funds 2.76%(5)\nOther expenses 3.21%(6)\nTotal annual expenses 9.01%\n(1) In the event that the securities are sold to or through underwriters or agents, the applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement\nwill disclose the applicable sales load (underwriting discount or commission) to be borne by us and our shareholders.\n(2) The applicable prospectus or prospectus supplement will disclose the estimated amount of offering expenses, the offering price\nand the offering expenses borne by us as a percentage of the offering price.\n(3) We are externally managed by RCM, and the Base Management Fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of our total assets\n(other than cash or cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds). Consequently, if we have borrowings\noutstanding, the Base Management Fee as a percentage of net assets attributable to common shares would be higher than if we did\nnot utilize leverage.\n(4) The portion of Incentive Fees paid with respect to net investment income and capital gains, if any, is based on actual amounts\nincurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 and paid during the first quarter of 2024. Such Incentive Fees are based on\nperformance, vary from period to period and are not paid unless our performance exceeds specified thresholds. Incentive Fees in\nrespect of net investment income do not include incentive fees in respect of net capital gains. See “Item 1. Business – Incentive\nFees.” As we cannot predict our future net investment income or capital gains, the Incentive Fee paid in future periods, if any,\nmay be substantially different than the fee reported during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n(5) Assumes borrowings representing approximately 29% of our average net assets at an average annual interest rate of 8.2%. The\namount of leverage that we may employ at any particular time will depend on, among other things, our Board’s and RCM’s\nassessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\n(6) Other expenses in this table represents our estimated operating expenses and income tax expenses for the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2024, including the Acquired Funds Fees and Expenses of the business development company stocks in our\ninvestment portfolio.\nExample\nThe following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over\nvarious periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock. In calculating the following expense amounts, we\nhave assumed that our interest payments on borrowed funds, capital gains incentive fees paid, and other annual operating expenses\nwould remain at the levels set forth in the table above. The example assumes that all dividends and other distributions are reinvested at\nNAV.\n1 year 3 years 5 years 10 years\nYou would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 common stock\ninvestment, assuming a 5% annual return $ 94 $ 270 $ 434 $ 788\nWhile the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return\ngreater or less than 5%. Assuming a 5% annual return, the Income Based Fee under the Investment Management Agreement may not\nbe earned or payable and is not included in the example. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments to trigger the Income\nBased Fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher.\nThis example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual\nexpenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown.\nItem 6. (Reserved.)\n32\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with\nthe consolidated financial statements and related notes included within Item 8 of this Annual Report.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements included in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and\nelsewhere in this report that do not relate to present or historical conditions are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of\nthat term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended. Additional oral or written forward-looking statements may be made by us from time to time, and forward-looking\nstatements may be included in documents that are filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that\ncould cause our results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking\nstatements may include, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions,\nincluding statements related to our investment objectives and strategies and our intention to co-invest with certain of our affiliates; the\nimpact of our election as a RIC for U.S. federal tax purposes on the payment of corporate level U.S. federal income taxes by Rand;\nstatements regarding our liquidity and financial resources; statements regarding any capital gains fee that may be due to RCM upon a\nhypothetical liquidation of our portfolio and the amount of the capital gains fee that may be payable for 2023; and statements\nregarding our compliance with the RIC requirements as of December 31, 2023, and future dividend payments are intended to be made\npursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “believes,” “forecasts,”\n“intends,” “possible,” “expects,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” or “plans” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-\nlooking statements. Among the important factors on which such statements are based are assumptions the state of the United States\neconomy and the local markets in which our portfolio companies operate, the state of the securities markets in which the securities of\nour portfolio companies could be traded, liquidity within the United States financial markets, and inflation. Forward-looking\nstatements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties described under the caption “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this\nAnnual Report.\nThere may be other factors not identified that affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-\nlooking statement speaks only as of the date when it is made and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any\nforward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of\nanticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to\ndevelop as we expect, and we cannot predict all of them.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed non-diversified investment company that lends to and invests in lower middle market\ncompanies. Our investment objective is to generate current income and when also possible, capital appreciation, by targeting\ninvestment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Rand\nCapital Management, LLC (“RCM”).\nWe have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940,\nas amended (the “1940 Act”). As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements specified in the 1940 Act.\nPrior to 2020, we made the majority of our investments through our wholly owned subsidiary, Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. (“Rand\nSBIC”), which operated as a small business investment company (“SBIC”) and had been licensed by the U.S. Small Business\nAdministration (“SBA”) since 2002. In November 2021, Rand SBIC repaid its $11.0 million in outstanding debentures to the SBA. In\naddition, in November 2021, Rand SBIC received approval from the SBA to surrender its SBA license. In connection with the\nsurrender of its SBA license, Rand SBIC changed its name to Rand Capital Sub, Inc. (“Rand Sub”), withdrew its election to be\nregulated as a BDC, and merged with and into Rand Capital Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of Rand. All of our investments going forward are expected be made out of Rand Capital Corporation (the “Corporation”,\n“we” or “Rand”) and our blocker corporation subsidiaries.\nIn November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the “Transaction”) with East Asset Management (“East”).\nThe Transaction consisted of a $25 million investment in Rand by East, in exchange for approximately 8.3 million shares of Rand\ncommon stock. Concurrent with the closing of the Transaction with East on November 8, 2019, Rand entered into an investment\nadvisory and management agreement (the “Prior Investment Management Agreement”) and an administration agreement (the “Prior\nAdministration Agreement”) with RCM. In connection with retaining RCM as our investment adviser and administrator, Rand’s\nmanagement and staff became employees of RCM.\n33\nIn December 2020, Rand’s shareholders approved a new investment advisory and management agreement (the “Investment\nManagement Agreement”) with RCM at a special meeting of shareholders (the “Special Meeting”). The approval was required\nbecause Callodine Group, LLC (“Callodine”) planned to acquire a controlling interest in RCM, which was, at that time, majority\nowned by East (the “Adviser Change of Control”). Callodine is a yield focused asset management platform. The terms of the\nInvestment Management Agreement are identical to those contained in the Prior Investment Management Agreement, with RCM\ncontinuing to provide investment advisory and management services to Rand following the Adviser Change of Control. Following\napproval by Rand’s shareholders at the Special Meeting, Rand, on December 31, 2020, entered into the Investment Management\nAgreement and a new administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with RCM and terminated the Prior Administration\nAgreement. The terms of the Administration Agreement are identical to those contained in the Prior Administration Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee and may pay an\nincentive fee, comprised of two parts: (1) the \"Income Based Fee\" and (2) the \"Capital Gains Fee\", if specified benchmarks are met.\nWe elected U.S federal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under subchapter M of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of\nincome and asset diversification requirements. As of December 31, 2023, we believe we were in compliance with the RIC\nrequirements. As a RIC, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or\ncapital gains that we timely distribute to our shareholders as dividends. We must distribute annually to our shareholders at least 90%\nof our ordinary net income and realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any.\nAccordingly, Rand's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") has initiated a quarterly cash dividend.\nThe Board declared and we paid the following cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nDividend/Share\nQuarter Amount Record Date Payment Date Type\n1st $ 0.20 March 13, 2023 March 27, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n2nd $ 0.25 May 31, 2023 June 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n3rd $ 0.25 August 31, 2023 September 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.25 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.38 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Special\nWe intend to co-invest, subject to the conditions included in the exemptive relief order we received from the SEC, with\ncertain of our affiliates. See “SEC Exemptive Order” below. We believe these types of co-investments are likely to afford us\nadditional investment opportunities and provide an ability to achieve greater diversification in our investment portfolio.\nSEC Exemptive Order\nOn October 7, 2020, Rand, RCM and certain of their affiliates received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit the\nCorporation to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain affiliates, including other BDCs and registered investment companies,\nmanaged by RCM and certain of its affiliates, in a manner consistent with the Corporation’s investment objective, positions, policies,\nstrategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). On March\n29, 2021, the SEC granted Rand, RCM, Callodine, which holds a controlling interest in RCM, and certain of their affiliates a new\nexemptive order (the “New Order”) that superseded the Order and permits Rand to co-invest with affiliates managed by RCM and\nCallodine. Pursuant to the New Order, the Corporation is generally permitted to co-invest with affiliates covered by the New Order if\na “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of Rand’s independent directors makes certain conclusions in\nconnection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are\nreasonable and fair to Rand and its shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of Rand or its shareholders on the part of\nany person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Rand’s shareholders and is consistent with Rand’s\ninvestment objective and strategies and (3) the investment by Rand’s affiliates would not disadvantage Rand, and Rand’s participation\nwould not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which Rand’s affiliates are investing. In addition, on\nSeptember 6, 2022, the SEC granted an amendment to the New Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our\nexisting portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds (as defined in the New Order) that do not hold any investments in such\nexisting portfolio companies.\nOutlook\nRand’s strategy is to continue to grow and scale its business by focusing on debt and related equity investments in privately-\nheld, lower middle market companies to drive investment income growth in order to increase the dividend paid to our shareholders.\nDuring 2023, we paid total dividends of $1.33 per share, which included a $0.38 per share special dividend that was paid in the fourth\n34\nquarter of 2023. Our aggregate total dividends represented an increase of 60% over our 2022 dividends paid. Given our strong\nperformance during the year, we raised our regular quarterly cash dividend by 20%, or $0.05 per share, to $0.25 per share in the\nsecond quarter of 2023.\nWe entered 2023 with a strong and flexible balance sheet that was supported by multiple sources of capital. During 2023, we\nmonetized some equity investments, exited some of our publicly traded securities and had loan repayments that provided\napproximately $10 million of cash proceeds. In addition, we drew down approximately $13.7 million from our senior secured\nrevolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\"). In total, we put approximately $20.3 million of available cash to work during 2023,\nprimarily in income producing investments to increase our investment income. At the end of 2023, having put our capital to work and\ndistributing $3.4 million in cash dividends to shareholders, we had $3.3 million in cash on hand and $8.8 million of availability on our\nCredit Facility for future investments. We also held shares valued at approximately $7.3 million in publicly traded companies, all of\nwhich are available for future liquidity and capital for prospective opportunities that will provide higher yields.\nWe continued to shift our investment portfolio composition in 2023 towards more debt instruments, and we expect that trend\nto continue into 2024. At December 31, 2023, our portfolio was comprised of 64% interest yielding debt instruments compared with\n56% at the end of 2022, improving our portfolio yield and net interest income. The annualized weighted average yield of the portfolio\nwas 13.6% at the end of 2023 compared with 12.6% at the end of 2022.\nWith the support of our liquidity position, we believe we can continue to execute our strategy to grow our portfolio, drive\ninvestment income and support a growing dividend.\nWe have been, and will continue to be, subject to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, particularly in periods of\nrising interest rates. As of December 31, 2023, all of our debt investments had fixed interest rates, whereas borrowings under our\nCredit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i)\nthe applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25%. In periods of rising interest rates or periods during\nwhich interest rates remain at an elevated level, the rate and amount of interest we earn and collect on our debt investments with fixed\ninterest rates will remain the same, while the interest incurred on our borrowings under the Credit Facility will increase. As a result,\nduring these periods, our business and results of operations can be adversely effected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nIndebtedness - Because we often borrow money to make our investments, if market interest rates continue to increase, our cost of\ncapital under our Credit Facility is likely to also increase, which could reduce our net investment income.”\nTrends and Opportunities\nWe believe the combination of cash on hand, line of credit availability, highly liquid publicly traded BDC stocks, proceeds\nfrom portfolio exits, and prospective investment income provide us the liquidity that will enable us to add new investments to our\nportfolio and reinvest in existing portfolio companies that demonstrate continued growth potential. RCM continues to build, on our\nbehalf, a pipeline of investment opportunities in order to put our capital to work.\nThe following short and long-term trends provide us confidence in our ability to grow the Corporation:\n• We expect that well run businesses will require capital to grow and should be able to compete effectively given eager\nreception of new technologies and service concepts, regardless of the macroeconomic environment.\n• We continue to manage risk by investing with other investors, when possible.\n• RCM, on our behalf, is involved with the governance and management of a majority of our portfolio companies, which\nenables us to support their operating and marketing efforts and facilitate their growth.\n• Having RCM serve as our external investment adviser allows us to leverage a broad range of investment and regulatory\ncompliance expertise with a cost structure that takes advantage of scales under Callodine Group.\n• We believe that having RCM serve as our external investment adviser and its ownership by Callodine, as well as our\nrelationship with East, broadens our potential pipeline of investment opportunities to build our portfolio, facilitate growth and\nreduce operating expenses as a percentage of portfolio assets. Strategically, we expect to advance our efforts to increase our\nincome-producing investments to support and to allow us to continue to increase our regular cash dividend for shareholders.\nAdditionally, we expect to continue to support our portfolio companies with equity investments that drive capital\nappreciation.\n• We believe an opportunity for lending to lower middle market companies exists because the consolidation among\ncommercial banks has reduced their focus on the lower middle market business. Heightened regulatory requirements for\n35\ncommercial banks have also resulted in less participation by banks in the lower middle market lending arena, opening up\nopportunities for alternative lenders such as us.\n• Lower middle market companies are increasingly seeking lenders with long-term capital to provide flexible solutions for their\ndebt and equity financing needs. We believe that many lower middle market companies prefer to execute transactions with\nalternative lenders, such as us, because we can address their capital requirements quickly and in the “check size” that is best\nsuited for their businesses.\n• We believe we have sufficient liquid assets to invest in new opportunities.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles,\nor GAAP, which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. For a summary\nof all significant accounting policies, including critical accounting policies, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item\n8 of this Annual Report.\nThe increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to\nmonitor our accounting policies and procedures. We have two critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgment.\nThe following summary of critical accounting policies is intended to enhance a reader’s ability to assess our financial condition and\nresults of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates.\nValuation of Investments\nOur investments are carried at fair value in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, “Fair\nValue Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with\nGAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nInvestments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by RCM and approved by our Board. We generally invest in\nloan, debt, and equity instruments and there is no single standard for determining fair value of these investments. As a result,\ndetermining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio company while\nemploying a consistent valuation process. We analyze and value each investment quarterly and record unrealized depreciation for an\ninvestment that we believe has become impaired, including where collection of a loan or realization of the recorded value of an equity\nsecurity is doubtful. Conversely, we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that an underlying portfolio company has\nappreciated in value and, therefore, its equity security has also appreciated in value. These estimated fair values may differ from the\nvalues that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our\nassumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events.\nLoan investments are defined as traditional loan financings typically with no equity features or required equity co-\ninvestment. Debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights, stock\npurchase warrants, and/or stock purchase options. Equity investments will be direct investments into a portfolio company and may\ninclude preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\nWe utilize several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment. The main approaches are:\n• Loan and debt securities are generally valued using a cost approach and will be valued at cost when representative of the fair\nvalue of the investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds are expected to exist from a sale of a portfolio company at\nits estimated fair value. The valuation may also consider the carrying interest rate versus the related inherent portfolio risk of\nthe investment. A loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality, collection is in doubt\nor insufficient liquidation proceeds exist.\n• Equity securities may be valued using the “cost approach”, “market approach” or “income approach.” The cost approach uses\nestimates of the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. The market approach uses\nobservable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions. It may include both private and\npublic M&A transactions where the traded price is a multiple of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and\nAmortization) or another relevant operating metric. It may also include the market value of comparable public companies that\nare trading in an active market, or the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to assist in pricing the\ninvestment. Additionally, we adjust valuations if a subsequent significant equity financing has occurred that includes a\nmeaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor. The income approach employs valuation\n36\ntechniques to convert future benefits or costs, usually in the form of cash flows, into a present value amount. The\nmeasurement is based on value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, used in our valuation at the measurement date.\nUnder the valuation policy, we value unrestricted publicly traded companies, categorized as Level 1 investments, at the\nclosing price on the last trading day of the reporting period.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value.\nFinancial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.\nAny changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, 9% of our investments were Level 1 investments and 91% were Level 3 investments. At December\n31, 2022, 10% of our investments were Level 1 investments and 90% were Level 3 investments. There were no Level 2 investments at\nDecember 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.\nIn the valuation process, we value restricted securities, categorized as Level 3 investments, using information from these\nportfolio companies, which may include:\n• Audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets;\n• Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company;\n• Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations;\n• The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation event\nwere to occur;\n• Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company;\n• Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent fundraising transactions;\n• Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed;\n• Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio company;\n• Internal circumstances and events that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of the\nportfolio company;\n• Qualitative assessment of key management;\n• Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and\n• Other factors deemed relevant to assess valuation.\nThe valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company’s performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the\nfactors that led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our equity investments are earnings before interest,\ntaxes and depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational\nperformance of the business, and the debt and senior equity preferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard\nindustry multiples may be used when available; however, our portfolio companies are typically privately-held, lower middle market\ncompanies and these industry standards may be adjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational performance of\nthe portfolio company. Due to the nature of certain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may\ninclude third party appraisals. Significant changes in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair\nvalue estimate.\n37\nAnother key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction with a\nsophisticated non-strategic unrelated new investor entered into by the portfolio company. The terms of these equity transactions may\nnot be identical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and us, and the impact of the difference in transaction terms\non the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\nWhen appropriate the Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes.\nThis model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the\nvaluation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable\ninputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nFor investments made within the last year, we generally rely on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent fair value, unless\nother fair market value inputs are identified causing us to depart from this basis.\nLoans and Debt Securities\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our loan and debt securities are the financial and\noperational performance of the portfolio company, similar debt with similar terms with other portfolio companies, as well as the\nmarket acceptance for the portfolio company’s products or services. These inputs will likely provide an indicator as to the probability\nof principal recovery of the investment. Our loan and debt investments are often junior secured or unsecured securities. Fair value\nmay also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate. Significant changes to the unobservable inputs may result in a\nchange in fair value. For recent investments, we generally rely on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the fair value, unless\nother fair value inputs are identified causing us to depart from this basis.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is in default or otherwise presumed to be in\ndoubt. In such cases, interest is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible losses on interest receivable is maintained\nwhen appropriate. Interest income is not recognized if collection is doubtful, and a 100% reserve is established. The collection of\ninterest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio company’s ability to continue as a going concern\nor a loan is in default for more than 120 days. RCM also uses other qualitative and quantitative measures to determine the value of a\nportfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest.\nWe hold debt securities in our investment portfolio that contain payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest provisions. PIK interest,\ncomputed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is added to the principal balance of the debt and is recorded as\ninterest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.\nWe may receive distributions from portfolio companies that are limited liability companies or corporations, and these\ndistributions are classified as dividend income on the consolidated statement of operations. Dividend income is recognized on an\naccrual basis when it can be reasonably estimated for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded\nportfolio companies.\nWe hold preferred equity securities that may contain cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are recorded as\ndividend income when they are declared and deemed a contractual obligation. Any dividends in arrears are added to the balance of\nthe preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as the preferred\nsecurity is redeemed.\n38\nFinancial Condition\nOverview:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 Increase Increase\nTotal assets $ 81,021,982 $ 63,481,192 $ 17,540,790 27.6%\nTotal liabilities 20,206,769 5,759,872 14,446,897 250.8%\nNet assets $ 60,815,213 $ 57,721,320 $ 3,093,893 5.4%\nNet asset value (NAV) was $23.56 per share at December 31, 2023 versus $22.36 per share at December 31, 2022.\nCash approximated 5% of net assets at December 31, 2023 compared to 2% at December 31, 2022.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a $25 million Credit Facility with M&T Bank, as lender (the “Lender”),\nwith the amount that we can borrow thereunder, at any given time, determined based upon a borrowing base formula. The Credit\nFacility has a 5-year term with a maturity date of June 27, 2027. Our borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable\nrate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured\novernight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25%. At December 31, 2023, there was $16.25 million drawn on the Credit Facility, and\nthe applicable interest rate was 8.88%. See “Note 5. Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility” in the Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our Credit Facility.\nComposition of the Investment Portfolio\nOur financial condition is dependent on the success of our portfolio holdings.

As a result, we are focused on investing in higher yielding debt instruments and\nrelated equity investments in privately held, lower middle market companies with a committed and experienced management team in a\nbroad variety of industries. At times when excess cash is available on our balance sheet, we may also invest in publicly traded shares\nof other business development companies that provide income through dividends and have more liquidity than our private company\nequity investments.\n39\nThe change in investments, at cost, during the year ended December 31, 2023, is comprised of the following:\nCost\nIncrease (Decrease)\nNew investments:\nBMP Food Service Supply Holdco, LLC (FSS) $ 4,535,000\nInter-National Electronic Alloys LLC (INEA) 4,300,000\nHighland All About People Holdings, Inc.

At December 31,\n2023, our portfolio was comprised of 64% interest yielding debt instruments compared with 56% at the end of 2022. New debt\ninstruments were originated from BMP Food Service Supply Holdco, LLC (FSS), FCM Industries Holdco LLC (First Coast Mulch),\nHighland All About People Holdings, Inc. (All About People), Inter-National Electronic Alloys LLC (INEA), ITA Acquisition, LLC\n(ITA), and Pressure Pro, Inc.

(Golub) — 9,375\nOwl Rock Capital Corporation (Owl Rock) — 9,300\nTotal dividend and other investment income $ 1,037,131 $ 1,456,334\nFee income - Fee income generally consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to the\nportfolio companies upon successful closing of financings, income from portfolio company board attendance fees, income associated\nwith portfolio company monitoring fees, and other miscellaneous fees. The financing fees are amortized ratably over the life of the\ninstrument associated with the fees. The unamortized fees are carried on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under the\nline item “Deferred revenue.”\nThe income associated with the amortization of financing fees was $205,480 and $120,914 for the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a one-time early prepayment fee of $61,264\nfrom our investment in DSD, a loan monitoring fee of $20,000 from our investment in BMP Food Service Supply Holdco, LLC (FSS),\na loan monitoring fee of $20,000 from our investment in Pressure Pro, Inc. (Pressure Pro), a loan monitoring fee of $12,000 from our\ninvestment in FCM Industries Holdco LLC (First Coast Mulch), and a loan modification fee of $2,000 from our investment in\nLumious (Tech 2000, Inc.). During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a board attendance fee of $25,000 from our\ninvestment in Empire Genomics Corp (Empire Genomics) and a loan monitoring fee of $10,000 from our investment in Seybert’s\nBilliards Corporations (Seybert's).\nExpenses\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 Increase % Increase\nTotal expenses $ 4,178,319 $ 1,119,229 $ 3,059,090 273.3%\nTotal expenses increased approximately $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an approximately $1,850,000 increase in the capital gains\nincentive fee expense, an approximately $970,000 increase in interest expense, an approximately $150,000 increase in administrative\nfees, and an approximately $130,000 increase in Base Management Fees payable to RCM.\nThe increase in the capital gains incentive fee accrual during the year ended December 31, 2023 is due to the calculation of\nthe capital gains fee as required by GAAP. We are required under GAAP to accrue capital gains incentive fees on the basis of net\nrealized capital gains and losses and net unrealized gains and losses. Our capital gains incentive fee accrual reflects the capital gains\nincentive fees that would be payable to RCM if our entire investment portfolio was liquidated at its fair value as of the balance sheet\ndate, even though RCM is not entitled to this capital gains incentive fee under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to\nunrealized gains unless and until such gains are actually realized.\nThe interest expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 result from interest payable pursuant to the Credit\nFacility we entered into during 2022 with the Lender, which provides us with a senior secured revolving credit facility in a principal\namount not to exceed $25 million. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was approximately $1,040,000\nand $70,000, respectively.\n42\nAdministrative fees consists of certain costs incurred by RCM that are reimbursable under the Investment Management\nAgreement and Administration Agreement. We incurred $149,000 in administrative fees during the year ended ended December 31,\n2023. There was no corresponding expense during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Base Management Fee, payable to RCM, is calculated based upon total assets less cash, and, as we deploy more capital\ninto investments, the Base Management Fee, payable to RCM, will increase accordingly.\nNet Investment Income\nThe excess of investment income over total expenses, including income taxes, represents net investment income. The net\ninvestment income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $2,967,733 and $4,430,410, respectively.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses on Investments\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nNet realized gain on sales and dispositions, before income taxes $ 1,051,079 $ 705,493\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold our investment in DSD Operating, LLC (DSD) and recognized a realized\ngain of approximately $2,460,000.

The principal measure of our financial performance\nis “Net (decrease) increase in net assets from operations” on our consolidated statements of operations. The net increase (decrease) in\nnet assets from operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $6,526,650 and ($881,849), respectively.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nThe comparison of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 can be found in our annual report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 located within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nand Results of Operations, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 10, 2023.\n45\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to meet anticipated cash requirements, fund new and follow-on portfolio investments,\npay distributions to our shareholders and other general business demands. As of December 31, 2023, our liquidity consisted of\napproximately $3,300,000 in cash, approximately $7,300,000 that is available to be obtained upon the liquidation of our publicly\ntraded equity securities of several BDCs and ACV Auctions, and $8,750,000 in remaining availability on our Credit Facility.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we entered into a $25 million Credit Facility. The amount we can borrow, at any given\ntime, under the Credit Facility is tied to a borrowing base, which is measured as (i) 75% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values\nof the publicly traded equity securities we hold (other than shares of ACV Auctions) plus (ii) the least of (a) 75% of the fair market\nvalue of the shares of ACV Auctions we hold, (b) $6.25 million and (c) 25% of the aggregate borrowing base availability for the\nCredit Facility at any date of determination plus (iii) 50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of eligible private loans we\nhold that meet specified criteria plus (iv) the lesser of (a) 50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of unsecured private\nloans we hold that meet specified criteria and (b) $1.25 million minus (v) such reserves as the Lender may establish from time to time\nin its sole discretion. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of June 27, 2027. The outstanding balance drawn on the Credit Facility at\nDecember 31, 2023 was $16,250,000. Under the borrowing base formula described above, the unused line of credit balance for the\nCredit Facility was $8,750,000 at December 31, 2023.\nOur borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50\npercentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25%. At\nDecember 31, 2023, our applicable interest rate under the Credit Facility was 8.88%.\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants usual and\ncustomary for agreements of this type, including among others covenants that prohibit, subject to certain specified exceptions, our\nability to merge or consolidate with other companies, sell any material part of our assets, incur other indebtedness, incur liens on our\nassets, make investments or loans to third parties other than permitted investments and permitted loans, and declare any distribution or\ndividend other than certain permitted distributions. The Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: (i) a tangible net\nworth covenant that requires us to maintain a Tangible Net Worth (defined in the Credit Agreement as our aggregate assets, excluding\nintangible assets, less all of our liabilities) of not less than $50.0 million, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter,\n(ii) an asset coverage ratio covenant that requires us to maintain an Asset Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio\nof the fair market value of all of our assets to the sum of all of our obligations for borrowed money plus all capital lease obligations) of\nnot less than 3:1, which is measured quarterly at the end of each fiscal quarter and (iii) an interest coverage ratio covenant that requires\nus to maintain an Interest Coverage Ratio (defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit\nAgreement) to Interest Expense (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) of not less than 2.5:1, which is measured quarterly on a trailing\ntwelve-months basis. We have calculated that we were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we experienced a net increase in cash in the amount of approximately $1,926,000,\nwhich is a net effect of approximately $8,341,000 of cash used in our operating activities and approximately $10,267,000 provided by\nour financing activities.\nThe $8,341,000 of cash used in our operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023, resulted primarily from\napproximately $20,348,000 to fund new or follow-on portfolio company investments and approximately $1,226,000 in non-cash\ninterest income. This was mostly offset by net investment income of approximately $2,968,000, approximately $10,001,000 from the\nsales and repayments of debt investments and the return on capital of our equity investments, and an approximately $747,000 net\nincrease in operating liabilities.\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was approximately $10,267,000.\nThis is comprised of the $13,700,000 borrowed from the line of credit and approximately $3,433,000 in dividends paid to\nshareholders.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through cash generated through our ongoing operating\nactivities, the sale of our publicly traded liquid investments, and through borrowings under the $25 million Credit Facility. We\nanticipate that we will continue to exit investments. However, the timing of liquidation events within our privately held investments is\ndifficult to project.\nThe following table summarizes the cash estimated to be received over the next five years from existing portfolio companies\nbased on contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023. These payments represent scheduled principal and interest payments that\nare due under the terms of the investment securities we own in each portfolio company and are subject to change based on factors such\n46\nas conversions, restructurings and other events that may be beyond our control. It does not include the effect of equity investments,\nwhich may provide additional proceeds upon exit of the investment.\nCash Receipts due by year\n2028 and\n2024 2025 2026 2027 beyond\nScheduled cash receipts from portfolio companies $ 14,960,000 $ 7,600,000 $ 20,560,000 $ 9,410,000 $ 15,590,000\nNumber of companies contributing to the scheduled\ncash receipts 16 12 10 6 5\nRegulated Investment Company (RIC) Status and Distributions\nWe have elected U.S federal tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As long as we qualify as a RIC, we will\nnot be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to\nthe extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to stockholders on a timely basis.\nTaxable income commonly differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent\ndifferences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until\nrealized. Dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the\ndistribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the\ncurrent year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nWe intend to continue to declare and pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders. To avoid certain excise taxes imposed on\nRICs, we generally strive to distribute, during each calendar year, an amount at least equal to the sum of:\n• 98% of our ordinary net taxable income for the calendar year;\n• 98.2% of our capital gains, if any, in excess of capital losses for the one-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar\nyear; and\n• any net ordinary income and net capital gains for the preceding year that were not distributed during such year and on which\nwe do not pay corporate tax.\nThe amount of our declared dividends, as recommended by RCM and approved by our Board, is based primarily on an\nevaluation of our net taxable income and our capital gains, in excess of capital losses.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31,\n2023:\nPayments Due by Period\nLess than one More than 5\nContractual Obligations Total year 2 - 3 years 4 - 5 years years\nCredit Facility $ 16,250,000 $ - $ - $16,250,000 $ -\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks primarily consisting of risks resulting from changes in interest rates and the valuation of\nour investment portfolio.\nInterest Rate Risk\nChanges in interest rates may affect our interest expense on the debt outstanding under our Credit Facility. Our debt borrowings\nunder the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal to 3.50 percentage points above the\ngreater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25%. Changes in interest rates can also\naffect, among other things, our ability to acquire and originate loans and securities and the value of our investment portfolio. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, all of our debt investments had fixed interest rates and were not directly impacted by changes in market interest\nrates.\n47\nBased on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of December 31, 2023, the following table shows the approximate\nannualized increase (decrease) in net investment income due to hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates under our Credit\nFacility, assuming no changes in our borrowings as of December 31, 2023. Because we often borrow money to make investments, our\nnet investment income is dependent upon the difference between our borrowing rate and the rate we earn on the invested proceeds\nborrowed. In periods of rising interest rates, the rate we earn on our debt investments with fixed interest rates will remain the same,\nwhile the interest incurred on our borrowings under the Credit Facility will increase. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nIndebtedness - Because we often borrow money to make our investments, if market interest rates continue to increase, our cost of\ncapital under our Credit Facility is likely to also increase, which could reduce our net investment income.”\nImpact on net investment income from a change in interest rates\non our Credit Facility at:\n1% 2% 3%\nIncrease in interest rate $ (162,500) $ (325,000) $ (487,500)\nDecrease in interest rate 162,500 325,000 487,500\nAlthough we believe that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity under our Credit Facility at December\n31, 2023, it does not adjust for changes in the credit quality, size and composition of our investment portfolio, and other business\ndevelopments, including borrowing under our Credit Facility, that could affect our net investment income. Accordingly, no assurances\ncan be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis.\nWe do not currently engage in any hedging activities. However, we may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by\nusing standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against\nadverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our\nborrowed funds.\nValuation Risk\nWe carry our investments at fair value, as determined in good faith by RCM and approved by our Board. Determining fair value\nrequires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio company investment while employing a\nconsistent valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of portfolio investments, there may be\nmaterial risks associated with this determination including that estimated fair values may differ from the values that would have been\nused had a readily available market value for the investments existed and these differences could be material if our assumptions and\njudgments differ from results of actual liquidation events. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may\noccur over the life of the investments may cause the value realized on these investments to be different than the valuations that are\nassigned. The types of factors that we may take into account in valuation of our investments include, as relevant, third party\nvaluations, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does\nbusiness, comparison to publicly-traded securities, recent sales of or offers to buy comparable companies, and other relevant factors.\n48\nItem 8.

Restricted securities are subject to\none or more restrictions on resale and are not freely marketable. Type of investment for equity position is in the form of shares unless otherwise\nnoted as units or interests, i.e., preferred shares, common shares.\n(b) The Date Acquired column indicates the date on which the Corporation first acquired an investment.\n(c) Each equity percentage estimates the Corporation’s ownership interest in the applicable portfolio investment. The estimated ownership is\ncalculated based on the percent of outstanding voting securities held by the Corporation or the potential percentage of voting securities held by\nthe Corporation upon exercise of warrants or conversion of debentures, or other available data. If applicable, the symbol “<1%” indicates that\nthe Corporation holds an equity interest of less than one percent.\n(d) The Corporation’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value and establishes guidelines for\nmeasuring fair value. At December 31, 2023, ASC 820 designates 91% of the Corporation’s investments as “Level 3” assets. Under the\nvaluation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading\nday of the reporting period. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale and are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by\nour external investment advisor Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”) and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is considered to\nbe the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of\nany particular date, however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other\ndispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in determining the fair\nvalue of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the\ninvestment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have\nan impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 2. “Investments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(e) These investments are non-income producing. All other investments are income producing. Non-income producing investments have not\ngenerated cash payments of interest or dividends including LLC tax-related distributions within the last twelve months or are not expected to do\nso going forward. If a debt or a preferred equity investment fails to make its most recent payment, then the investment will also be classified as\nnon-income producing.\n(f) As of December 31, 2023, the total cost of investment securities was approximately $68.4 million. Net unrealized appreciation was\napproximately $8.8 million, which was comprised of $14.1 million of unrealized appreciation of investment securities and ($5.4) million of\nunrealized depreciation of investment securities. At December 31, 2023, the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes\nwas approximately $14.1 million and the aggregate gross unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was approximately ($4.2) million. The\nnet unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes was approximately $9.9 million based on a tax cost of approximately $68 million.\n(g) All of the Corporation’s portfolio assets are pledged as collateral for purposes of securing the Corporation’s senior secured revolving credit\nfacility pursuant to a general security agreement, dated June 27, 2022, between the Corporation, the subsidiaries listed therein, and the Lender\n(as defined herein).\n(h) Reduction in cost and value from previously reported balances reflects current principal repayment.\n(i) Represents interest due (amounts over $50,000) from investments included as interest receivable on the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements\nof Financial Position.\n(j) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\n(k) Affiliate Investments are defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), as those Non-Control investments in\ncompanies in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation.\n(l) Payment in kind (PIK) represents earned interest that is added to the cost basis of the investment and due at maturity.

Restricted securities are subject to one\nor more restrictions on resale and are not freely marketable. Type of investment for equity position is in the form of shares unless otherwise\nnoted as units or interests, i.e., preferred shares, common shares.\n(b) The Date Acquired column indicates the date on which the Corporation first acquired an investment.\n(c) Each equity percentage estimates the Corporation’s ownership interest in the applicable portfolio investment. The estimated ownership is\ncalculated based on the percent of outstanding voting securities held by the Corporation or the potential percentage of voting securities held by\nthe Corporation upon exercise of warrants or conversion of debentures, or other available data. If applicable, the symbol “<1%” indicates that\nthe Corporation holds an equity interest of less than one percent.\n(d) The Corporation’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting\nStandards Codification (ASC) 820 “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” which defines fair value and establishes guidelines for\nmeasuring fair value. At December 31, 2022, ASC 820 designates 90% of the Corporation’s investments as “Level 3” assets. Under the\nvaluation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities on the last trading\nday of the reporting period. Restricted securities are subject to restrictions on resale and are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by\nour external investment advisor Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”) and approved by the Board of Directors. Fair value is considered to\nbe the amount that the Corporation may reasonably expect to receive for portfolio securities when sold on the valuation date. Valuations as of\nany particular date, however, are not necessarily indicative of amounts which may ultimately be realized as a result of future sales or other\ndispositions of securities and these favorable or unfavorable differences could be material. Among the factors considered in determining the fair\nvalue of restricted securities are the financial condition and operating results, projected operations, and other analytical data relating to the\ninvestment. Also considered are the market prices for unrestricted securities of the same class (if applicable) and other matters which may have\nan impact on the value of the portfolio company (see Note 2. “Investments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n(e) These investments are non-income producing. All other investments are income producing. Non-income producing investments have not\ngenerated cash payments of interest or dividends including LLC tax-related distributions within the last twelve months or are not expected to do\nso going forward. If a debt or a preferred equity investment fails to make its most recent payment, then the investment will also be classified as\nnon-income producing.\n(f) As of December 31, 2022, the total cost of investment securities was approximately $55.7 million. Net unrealized appreciation was\napproximately $5.8 million, which was comprised of $13.5 million of unrealized appreciation of investment securities and ($7.7) million of\nunrealized depreciation of investment securities. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate gross unrealized gain for federal income tax purposes\nwas $13.2 million and the aggregate gross unrealized loss for federal income tax purposes was ($6.7) million. The net unrealized gain for\nfederal income tax purposes was $6.5 million based on a tax cost of $55.0 million.\n(g) All of the Corporation’s portfolio assets are pledged as collateral for purposes of securing the Corporation’s senior secured revolving credit\nfacility pursuant to a general security agreement, dated June 27, 2022, between the Corporation, the subsidiaries listed therein, and the Lender\n(as defined herein).\n(h) Reduction in cost and value from previously reported balances reflects current principal repayment.\n(i) Represents interest due (amounts over $50,000) from investments included as interest receivable on the Corporation’s Consolidated Statements\nof Financial Position. None at December 31, 2022.\n(j) Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments are investments that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\n(k) Affiliate Investments are defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (“1940 Act”), as those Non-Control investments in\ncompanies in which between 5% and 25% of the voting securities are owned by the Corporation.\n(l) Payment in kind (PIK) represents earned interest that is added to the cost basis of the investment and due at maturity. The amount of PIK\nearned is included in the interest rate detailed in the “Type of Investment” column, unless it has been noted with a (+), in which case the PIK is\nin addition to the face amount of interest due on the security.\n(m) Equity holdings are held in a wholly owned (100%) “blocker corporation” of Rand Capital Corporation or Rand Capital Sub LLC for federal\nincome tax and Regulated Investment Company (RIC) compliance.\n(n) Indicates assets that the Company believes do not represent “qualifying assets” under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Qualifying assets must\nrepresent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets at the time of acquisition of any additional non-qualifying assets. Of the Company’s total\nassets, 6.12% were non-qualifying assets as of December 31, 2022.\n(o) Control Investments are defined by the 1940 Act as investments in companies in which more than 25% of the voting securities are owned by the\nCorporation or where greater than 50% of the board representation is maintained.\n( p) Investments classified as Level 3 for purposes of the fair value determination by RCM and approved by the Board of Directors.\n66\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED SCHEDULE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS\nDecember 31, 2022 (Continued)\nInvestments

Beginning in 1971, Rand operated as a publicly traded, closed-end, management company that was registered under Section\n8 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”).\nIn 2001, Rand elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of\n1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). As a BDC, Rand is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements specified in the 1940\nAct. For instance, it generally has to invest at least 70% of total assets in “qualifying assets” and provide managerial assistance to the\nportfolio companies in which it invests.\nIn 2002, Rand formed a wholly owned subsidiary Rand Capital SBIC, Inc. (“Rand SBIC”) for the purpose of operating it as a\nsmall business investment company (“SBIC”) licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) and received an SBA\nlicense to operate as an SBIC in 2002. In 2012, the SEC granted an Order of Exemption for Rand with respect to the operations of\nRand SBIC. At that time, although Rand SBIC was operated as if it were a BDC, it was registered as an investment company under\nthe 1940 Act. Upon Rand’s receipt of the order granting the exemptions, Rand SBIC filed an election to be regulated as a BDC under\nthe 1940 Act. In November 2021, Rand SBIC repaid its $11,000,000 in outstanding debentures to the SBA and received approval from\nthe SBA to surrender its SBA license. This subsidiary was renamed Rand Capital Sub, Inc., and merged with and into Rand Capital\nSub LLC (“Rand Sub”). All of Rand’s investments going forward are expected to be made out of Rand Capital Corporation.\nIn November 2019, Rand completed a stock sale transaction (the “Closing”) with East Asset Management (“East”). The\ntransaction consisted of a $25 million investment in Rand by East, in exchange for approximately 8.3 million shares of Rand common\nstock. The consideration paid by East for the shares of Rand common stock was comprised of approximately $15.5 million of cash\nand a contribution of $9.5 million of portfolio assets (the “Contributed Assets”). Concurrent with the Closing, Rand’s management\nand staff became employees of Rand Capital Management, LLC (“RCM”), a registered investment adviser that has been retained by\nRand as its external investment adviser. In connection with retaining RCM as investment adviser, on November 8, 2019, Rand entered\ninto an investment advisory and management agreement (the “Prior Investment Management Agreement”) and an administration\nagreement (the “Prior Administration Agreement”) with RCM pursuant to which RCM serves as Rand’s investment adviser and\nadministrator (the Closing and the retention of RCM as investment adviser and administrator are collectively referred to herein as the\n“Transaction”). In connection with a change of control of RCM, Rand’s shareholders were asked to approve a new investment\nadvisory and management agreement (the “Investment Management Agreement”) with RCM at a special meeting of shareholders held\non December 16, 2020 (the “Special Meeting”). The terms of the Investment Management Agreement are identical to those contained\nin the Prior Investment Management Agreement, with RCM continuing to provide investment advisory and management services to\nRand. Following approval by Rand’s shareholders at the Special Meeting, Rand, on December 31, 2020, entered into the Investment\nManagement Agreement and a new administration agreement (the “Administration Agreement”) with RCM and terminated the Prior\nAdministration Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, Rand pays RCM a base management fee\nand may pay an incentive fee, if specified benchmarks are met.\nRand is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. In connection with the\ncompletion of the Transaction, Rand shifted to an investment strategy focused on higher yielding debt investments and elected U.S.\nFederal tax treatment as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) as of January 1, 2020 on its U.S. Federal tax return for the 2020 tax\nyear. As required for the RIC election, Rand paid a special dividend to shareholders to distribute all of its accumulated earnings and\nprofits since inception to 2019. Rand’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend of $23.7 million, or approximately $1.62 per\nshare, on March 3, 2020. The cash and shares of Rand’s common stock comprising the special dividend were distributed on May 11,\n2020 to shareholders. In addition, Rand’s Board of Directors declared a 2020 cash dividend of $1.33 per share on December 21, 2020.\nThis cash dividend was paid on January 19, 2021 to shareholders of record as of December 31, 2020. The cash dividend represented\nover 90% of Rand’s estimated investment company taxable income for 2020.\n71\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2022:\nDividend/Share\nQuarter Amount Record Date Payment Date Type\n1st $ 0.15 March 14, 2022 March 28, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n2nd $ 0.15 June 1, 2022 June 15, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n3rd $ 0.15 September 1, 2022 September 15, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.20 December 19, 2022 December 30, 2022 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.18 December 19, 2022 December 30, 2022 Special\nThe Board of Directors declared the following cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nDividend/Share\nQuarter Amount Record Date Payment Date Type\n1st $ 0.20 March 13, 2023 March 27, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n2nd $ 0.25 May 31, 2023 June 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n3rd $ 0.25 August 31, 2023 September 14, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.25 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Regular Quarterly\n4th $ 0.38 December 18, 2023 December 29, 2023 Special\nIn order to continue to qualify as a RIC, Rand holds several of its equity investments in holding companies that facilitate a\ntax structure that is advantageous to the RIC election. Rand has the following wholly-owned blocker companies in place at December\n31, 2023: Rand BMP Swanson Holdings Corp., Rand Carolina Skiff Holdings Corp., Rand DSD Holdings Corp., Rand Filterworks\nHoldings Corp., Rand FSS Holdings Corp., Rand INEA Holdings Corp., Rand ITA Holdings Corp., and Rand Somerset Holdings\nCorp. (the “Blocker Corps”). These subsidiaries are consolidated using United States generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) for financial reporting purposes.\nThe following discussion describes the operations of Rand and its wholly owned subsidiaries Rand Sub, Rand BMP Swanson\nHoldings Corp., Rand Carolina Skiff Holdings Corp., Rand DSD Holdings Corp., Rand Filterworks Holdings Corp., Rand FSS\nHoldings Corp., Rand INEA Holdings Corp., Rand ITA Holdings Corp., and Rand Somerset Holdings Corp. (collectively, the\n“Corporation”).\nRand effected a 1-for-9 reverse stock split of its common stock effective May 21, 2020. The reverse stock split affected all\nissued and outstanding shares of Rand's common stock, including shares held in treasury. The reverse stock split reduced the number\nof issued and outstanding shares of Rand’s common stock from 23,845,470 shares and 23,304,424 shares, respectively, to 2,648,916\nshares and 2,588,800 shares, respectively. The reverse stock split affected all shareholders uniformly and did not alter any\nshareholder's percentage interest in Rand’s outstanding common stock, except for adjustments for fractional shares.\nOn October 7, 2020, Rand, RCM and certain of their affiliates received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) to permit Rand to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain affiliates, including other BDCs and registered\ninvestment companies, managed by RCM and certain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with Rand’s investment objective,\npolicies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the “Order”). On\nMarch 29, 2021, the SEC granted Rand, Callodine Group, LLC (“Callodine”), which holds a controlling interest in RCM, and certain\nof their affiliates a new exemptive order (the “New Order”) that superseded the Order and permits Rand to co-invest with affiliates\nmanaged by RCM and Callodine. Callodine is a yield focused asset management platform. Pursuant to the New Order, Rand is\ngenerally permitted to co-invest with affiliates covered by the New Order if a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the\n1940 Act) of Rand’s independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1)\nthe terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to Rand and its shareholders and do not\ninvolve overreaching in respect of Rand or its shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with\nthe interests of Rand’s shareholders and is consistent with Rand’s investment objective and strategies and, (3) the investment by\nRand’s affiliates would not disadvantage Rand, and Rand’s participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous\nthan that on which Rand’s affiliates are investing. In addition, on September 6, 2022, the SEC granted an amendment to the New\nOrder to permit Rand to participate in follow-on investments in its existing portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds (as\ndefined in the New Order) that do not hold any investments in such existing portfolio companies.\n72\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nBasis of Presentation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP\nand pursuant to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K. The Corporation is an investment company following accounting and reporting\nguidance in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 946, Financial Services— Investment Companies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Rand and its wholly owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments – The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated statement of financial position of\ncash, interest receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term\nmaturity of these financial instruments.\nInvestment Classification – In accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Corporation classifies its investments by\nlevel of control. Under the 1940 Act “Control Investments” are investments in companies that the Corporation is deemed to “Control”\nif it owns more than 25% of the voting securities of the company or has greater than 50% representation on the company’s board.\n“Affiliate Investments” are companies in which the Corporation owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities. “Non-\nControl/Non-Affiliate Investments” are those companies that are neither Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.\nInvestments - Investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by RCM and approved by Rand’s Board of\nDirectors. The Corporation generally invests in loan, debt, and equity instruments and there is no single method for determining fair\nvalue of these investments. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances\nof each portfolio company while employing a consistent valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair\nvalue of portfolio investments, there may be material risks associated with this determination including that estimated fair values may\ndiffer from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value for the investments existed and these differences\ncould be material if the Corporation's assumptions and judgments differ from results of actual liquidation events. The Corporation\nanalyzes and values each investment quarterly and records unrealized depreciation for an investment that it believes has become\nimpaired, including where collection of a loan or debt security or realization of the recorded value of an equity security is doubtful.\nConversely, the Corporation will record unrealized appreciation if it believes that an underlying portfolio company has appreciated in\nvalue and, therefore, the Corporation's equity securities have also appreciated in value. Additionally, the Corporation continues to\nassess any material risks associated with this fair value determination, including risks associated with material conflicts of interest.\nUnder the valuation policy of the Corporation, unrestricted publicly traded securities are valued at the closing price for these securities\non the last trading day of the reporting period. (See Note 2 “Investments.”)\nQualifying Assets - The Corporation’s portfolio of investments includes both qualifying and non-qualifying assets. A\nmajority of the Corporation’s investments represent qualifying investments in privately held businesses, principally based in the\nUnited States, and represent qualifying assets as defined by Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. The non-qualifying assets generally\ninclude investments in other publicly traded BDC investment companies and other publicly traded securities.\nRevenue Recognition - Interest Income - Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis except where the investment is\nin default or otherwise presumed to be in doubt. In such cases, interest is recognized at the time of receipt. A reserve for possible\nlosses on interest receivable is maintained when appropriate. Interest income is not recognized if collection is doubtful, and a 100%\nreserve is established. The collection of interest is presumed to be in doubt when there is substantial doubt about a portfolio\ncompany’s ability to continue as a going concern or a loan is in default for more than 120 days. RCM also uses other qualitative and\nquantitative measures to determine the value of a portfolio investment and the collectability of any accrued interest.\nThe Corporation holds debt securities in its investment portfolio that contain payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest provisions.\nPIK interest, computed at the contractual rate specified in each debt agreement, is added to the principal balance of the debt and is\nrecorded as interest income. Thus, the actual collection of this interest may be deferred until the time of debt principal repayment.\nRevenue Recognition - Dividend Income – The Corporation may receive cash distributions from portfolio companies that\nare limited liability companies or corporations, and these distributions are classified as dividend income on the consolidated statement\nof operations. Dividend income is recognized on an accrual basis when it can be reasonably estimated for private portfolio companies\nor on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies.\nThe Corporation may hold preferred equity securities that contain cumulative dividend provisions. Cumulative dividends are\nrecorded as dividend income, if declared and deemed collectible, and any dividends in arrears are recognized into income and added to\n73\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nthe balance of the preferred equity investment. The actual collection of these dividends in arrears may be deferred until such time as\nthe preferred equity is redeemed.\nRevenue Recognition - Fee Income – Consists of the revenue associated with the amortization of financing fees charged to\nthe portfolio companies upon successful closing of financings, income associated with portfolio company board attendance fees,\nincome associated with portfolio company monitoring fees and income associated with portfolio company loan modification fees. The\nincome associated with the amortization of financing fees was $205,480, $120,914 and $87,018, for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is estimated to be approximately $169,000 in 2024, $164,000 in 2025 and $114,000 in 2026.\nNo board fees were earned during the year ended December 31, 2023. The board fees earned were $25,000 and $14,096 for the years\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation recorded $115,264 in\nnon-recurring fees related to early repayment fees, loan modification fees, and loan monitoring fees. During the year ended December\n31, 2022, the Corporation recorded $10,000 in non-recurring loan monitoring fees. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the\nCorporation recorded $55,500 in non-recurring fees related to prepayment fees, application fees and loan monitoring fees.\nRealized Gain or Loss and Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Investments - Amounts reported as realized gains\nand losses are measured by the difference between the proceeds from the sale or exchange and the cost basis of the investment without\nregard to unrealized gains or losses recorded in prior periods. The cost of securities that have, in management’s judgment, become\nworthless are written off and reported as realized losses when appropriate. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the\ndifference between the valuation of the investments and the cost basis of the investments.\nOriginal Issue Discount – Investments may include “original issue discount”, or OID, income. This occurs when the\nCorporation purchases a warrant and a note from a portfolio company simultaneously, which requires an allocation of a portion of the\npurchase price to the warrant and reduces the purchase price allocated to the note by an equal amount in the form of a note discount or\nOID. The note is reported net of the OID and the OID is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan. The Corporation\nrecognized $21,008, $25,008 and $112,175 in OID income for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. OID\nincome is estimated to be approximately $16,000 for 2024.\nDeferred Financing Fees - Origination and commitment costs related to the senior secured revolving credit facility with\nM&T Bank, (See Note 5 “Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility”), are amortized ratably over the term of the Credit Agreement.\nAmortization expense was approximately $25,000 and $12,500 for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAmortization expense is estimated to be $25,000 in 2024, $25,000 in 2025, and $25,000 in 2026.\nDeferred Debenture Costs - SBA debenture origination and commitment costs, which are netted against the debenture, are\namortized ratably over the term of the SBA debentures. In November 2021, Rand SBIC repaid its $11,000,000 in outstanding\ndebentures to the SBA and expensed all remaining SBA debenture origination and commitment costs. In addition, in November 2021,\nRand SBIC received approval from the SBA to surrender its SBA license. There was no amortization expense for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023 or 2022. Amortization expense was approximately $175,400 for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet Assets Per Share - Net assets per share are based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding. There are no\ncommon stock equivalents outstanding.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information - Income taxes paid (refunded) during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and\n2021 amounted to $645,248, ($5,284) and ($131,934), respectively. Interest paid during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021 was $934,638, $48,274 and $567,070, respectively. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation converted $1,225,773,\n$739,356, and $346,045, respectively, of interest receivable and payment-in-kind (PIK) interest into debt investments.\nConcentration of Credit and Market Risk – The Corporation’s financial instruments potentially subject it to concentrations\nof credit risk. Cash is invested with banks in amounts which, at times, exceed insured limits. The Corporation does not anticipate non-\nperformance by the banks.\n74\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following are the concentrations of the top five portfolio company values to the fair value of the Corporation’s total\ninvestment portfolio:\nDecember 31,\n2023\nTilson Technology Management, Inc. (Tilson) 14%\nBMP Food Service Supply Holdco, LLC (FSS) 10%\nSeybert’s Billiards Corporation (Seybert’s) 8%\nSciAps, Inc. (Sciaps) 7%\nInter-National Electronic Alloys LLC (INEA) 6%\nDecember 31,\n2022\nTilson Technology Management, Inc. (Tilson) 17%\nSeybert’s Billiards Corporation (Seybert’s) 10%\nSciAps, Inc. (Sciaps) 8%\nDSD Operating, LLC (DSD) 8%\nCaitec, Inc. (Caitec) 6%\nIncome Taxes - The Corporation reviews the tax positions it has taken to determine if they meet the \"more likely than not\nthreshold\" for the benefit of the tax position to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position that fails to meet the more\nlikely than not recognition threshold will result in either a reduction of a current or deferred tax asset or receivable, or the recording of\na current or deferred tax liability. (See Note 4 “Income Taxes.”)\nAccounting Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at\nthe date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements - In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, “Financial Instruments - Credit\nLosses (Topic 326)”, which is intended to address issues identified during the post-implementation review of ASU 2016-13,\n“Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”. The amendment,\namong other things, eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, “Receivables\n- Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors”, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and\nrestructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The new guidance is effective for interim and annual\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Corporation evaluated the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02 on its\nconsolidated financial statements and disclosures and determined that this guidance does not have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\", to\nexpand the disclosure requirements for income taxes, specifically related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-\n09 is effective for our annual periods beginning January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation is currently\nevaluating the potential effect that updated standard will have on its financial statement disclosures.\nNOTE 2. – INVESTMENTS\nThe Corporation’s investments are carried at fair value in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in\naccordance with GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nLoan investments are defined as traditional loan financings typically with no equity features or required equity co-\ninvestment. Debt investments are defined as debt financings that include one or more equity features such as conversion rights, stock\npurchase warrants, and/or stock purchase options. Equity investments will be direct investments into a portfolio company and may\ninclude preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\n75\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Corporation uses several approaches to determine the fair value of an investment. The main approaches are:\n• Loan and debt securities are generally valued using a cost approach and will be valued at cost when representative of the\nfair value of the investment or sufficient assets or liquidation proceeds are expected to exist from a sale of a portfolio\ncompany at its estimated fair value. The valuation may also consider the carrying interest rate versus the related inherent\nportfolio risk of the investment. A loan or debt instrument may be reduced in value if it is judged to be of poor quality,\ncollection is in doubt or insufficient liquidation proceeds exist.\n• Equity securities may be valued using the “cost approach”, “market approach” or “income approach.” The cost approach\nuses estimates of the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. The market approach uses\nobservable prices and other relevant information generated by similar market transactions. It may include both private\nand public M&A transactions where the traded price is a multiple of EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes,\nDepreciation and Amortization) or another relevant operating metric. It may also include the market value of comparable\npublic companies that are trading in an active market, or the use of market multiples derived from a set of comparables to\nassist in pricing the investment. Additionally, the Corporation adjusts valuations if a subsequent significant equity\nfinancing has occurred that includes a meaningful portion of the financing by a sophisticated, unrelated new investor.\nThe income approach employs valuation techniques to convert future benefits or costs, usually in the form of cash flows,\ninto a present value amount. The measurement is based on value indicated by current market expectations about those\nfuture amounts.\nASC 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, used in the Corporation’s valuation at the\nmeasurement date. Under the valuation policy, the Corporation values unrestricted publicly traded companies, categorized as\nLevel 1 investments, at the closing price on the last trading day of the reporting period.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other observable inputs other than quoted prices.\nLevel 3: Unobservable and significant inputs to determining the fair value.\nFinancial assets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.\nAny changes in estimated fair value are recorded in the statement of operations.\nAt December 31, 2023, 9% of the Corporation’s investments were Level 1 investments and 91% were Level 3 investments.\nAt December 31, 2022, 10% of the Corporation’s investments were Level 1 investments and 90% were Level 3 investments. There\nwere no Level 2 investments at December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nIn the valuation process, the Corporation values restricted securities, categorized as Level 3 investments, using information\nfrom these portfolio companies, which may include:\n• Audited and unaudited statements of operations, balance sheets and operating budgets;\n• Current and projected financial, operational and technological developments of the portfolio company;\n• Current and projected ability of the portfolio company to service its debt obligations;\n• The current capital structure of the business and the seniority of the various classes of equity if a deemed liquidation\nevent were to occur;\n• Pending debt or capital restructuring of the portfolio company;\n• Current information regarding any offers to purchase the investment, or recent fundraising transactions;\n• Current ability of the portfolio company to raise additional financing if needed;\n• Changes in the economic environment which may have a material impact on the operating results of the portfolio\ncompany;\n76\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n• Internal circumstances and events that may have an impact (both positive and negative) on the operating performance of\nthe portfolio company;\n• Qualitative assessment of key management;\n• Contractual rights, obligations or restrictions associated with the investment; and\n• Other factors deemed relevant to assess valuation.\nThe valuation may be reduced if a portfolio company’s performance and potential have deteriorated significantly. If the\nfactors that led to a reduction in valuation are overcome, the valuation may be readjusted.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities may include preferred stock, common stock, warrants and limited liability company membership interests.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s equity investments are EBITDA\nand revenue multiples, where applicable, the financial and operational performance of the business, and the debt and senior equity\npreferences that may exist in a deemed liquidation event. Standard industry multiples may be used when available; however, the\nCorporation’s portfolio companies are typically privately-held, lower middle market companies and these industry standards may be\nadjusted to more closely match the specific financial and operational performance of the portfolio company. Due to the nature of\ncertain investments, fair value measurements may be based on other criteria, which may include third party appraisals. Significant\nchanges in any of these unobservable inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nAnother key factor used in valuing equity investments is a significant recent arms-length equity transaction entered into by\nthe portfolio company with a sophisticated, non-strategic, unrelated, new investor. The terms of these equity transactions may not be\nidentical to the equity transactions between the portfolio company and the Corporation, and the impact of the difference in transaction\nterms on the market value of the portfolio company may be difficult or impossible to quantify.\nWhen appropriate the Black-Scholes pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of warrants for accounting purposes.\nThis model requires the use of highly subjective inputs including expected volatility and expected life, in addition to variables for the\nvaluation of minority equity positions in small private and early stage companies. Significant changes in any of these unobservable\ninputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value estimate.\nFor investments made within the last year, the Corporation generally relies on the cost basis, which is deemed to represent the\nfair value, unless other fair value inputs are identified causing the Corporation to depart from this basis.\nLoan and Debt Securities\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation’s loan and debt securities are the\nfinancial and operational performance of the portfolio company, similar debt with similar terms with other portfolio companies, as\nwell as the market acceptance for the portfolio company’s products or services. These inputs will likely provide an indicator as to the\nprobability of principal recovery of the investment. The Corporation’s loan and debt investments are often junior secured or unsecured\nsecurities. Fair value may also be determined based on other criteria where appropriate. Significant changes to the unobservable\ninputs may result in a change in fair value. For recent investments, the Corporation generally relies on the cost basis, which is deemed\nto represent the fair value, unless other fair value inputs are identified causing the Corporation to depart from this basis.\n77\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table provides a summary of the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of the\nCorporation’s Level 3 portfolio investments as of December 31, 2023:\nMarket Market\nApproach Approach\nEBITDA Liquidation Market Approach Market Approach\nInvestment Type Multiple Seniority Revenue Multiple Transaction Pricing Totals\nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Equity $ 72,522 $ — $ 700,000 $ 100,063 $ 872,585\nNon-Control/Non-Affiliate Loan and Debt 6,829,263 4,465,882 — — 11,295,145\nTotal Non-Control/Non-Affiliate $ 6,901,785 $ 4,465,882 $ 700,000 $ 100,063 $ 12,167,730\nAffiliate Equity $ 5,889,991 $ — $ 3,223,984 $ 10,550,000 $ 19,663,975\nAffiliate Loan and Debt 26,177,241 — 2,090,000 5,568,156 33,835,397\nTotal Affiliate $ 32,067,232 $ — $ 5,313,984 $ 16,118,156 $ 53,499,372\nControl Equity $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nControl Debt — 4,148,960 — — 4,148,960\nTotal Control $ — $ 4,148,960 $ — $ — $ 4,148,960\nTotal Level 3 Investments $ 38,969,017 $ 8,614,842 $ 6,013,984 $ 16,218,219 $ 69,816,062\nRange 4-7X 1X 1X-3X Not Applicable\nUnobservable Input EBITDA Revenue Transaction\nAsset Value\nMultiple Multiple Price\nWeighted Average 5.4 X 1X 1.7X Not Applicable\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of Level 1, 2 and 3 Assets Measured at Fair Value at December\n31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurements at Reported Date Using\nQuoted Prices Other\nin Active Significant Significant\nMarkets for Observable Unobservable\nDecember 31, Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\nDescription 2023 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nLoan investments $ 12,417,977 $ — $ — $ 12,417,977\nDebt investments 36,861,525 — — 36,861,525\nEquity investments 27,846,210 7,309,650 — 20,536,560\nTotal $ 77,125,712 $ 7,309,650 $ — $ 69,816,062\n78\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in Assets Measured at Fair Value Using Significant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2023:\nFair Value Measurements Using Significant\nUnobservable Inputs (Level 3)\nDebt Equity\nDescription Loan Investments Investments Investments Total\nEnding Balance December 31, 2022, of Level 3 Assets $ 14,578,351 $ 19,582,616 $ 20,935,744 $ 55,096,711\nRealized gains (losses) included in net change in net assets from\noperations:\nClearView Social, Inc.

As a result, the Corporation did not pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income\nor capital gains that the Corporation distributed to its stockholders as dividends. The Corporation must distribute substantially all of\nits investment company taxable income each tax year as dividends to its stockholders to maintain its RIC status. Depending on the\nlevel of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Corporation may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year\ndividend distributions from such current year taxable income into the next tax year and pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as\nrequired. To the extent that the Corporation determines that its estimated current year taxable income will be in excess of estimated\ndividend distributions for the current year from such income, the Corporation accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable\nincome as such taxable income is earned. The Corporation incurred $52,800 in federal excise tax expense during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The Corporation did not incur any federal excise tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDistributions from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with\nU.S. federal tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and those differences could be\nmaterial. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. Reclassifications due to permanent book-tax\ndifferences, including non-deductible taxes and the tax treatment of earnings from the subsidiaries, have no impact on net assets.\nThe following differences were reclassified for tax purposes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n20221:\n2023 2022\nIncrease (decrease) in capital in excess of par value $ 4,336,903 $ (215,542)\n(Decrease) increase in total distributable earnings (4,336,903) 215,542\nTaxable income generally differs from net increase (decrease) in net assets for financial reporting purposes due to temporary\nand permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses and generally excludes unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on\ninvestments, as investment gains and losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.\n1 The Corporation’s permanent book-to-tax reclassifications for 2023 are an estimate and will not be finalized until the Corporation\nfiles its 2023 federal income tax returns in 2024.

The actual tax\ncharacteristics of distributions to shareholders are reported to shareholders annually on Form 1099-DIV.\nThe tax basis components of distributable earnings (accumulated losses) and reconciliation to accumulated earnings (deficit)\non a book basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 were as follows:\n2023 2022\nUndistributed ordinary income – tax basis $ 332,806 $ 250,428\nCapital loss carry forwards (1,546,597) —\nUnrealized appreciation on investments 9,906,212 5,993,782\nGAAP vs tax basis consolidation of subsidiaries — 863,702\nOther temporary differences (2,376,665) 1,389,575\nTotal accumulated earnings – book basis $ 6,315,756 $ 8,497,487\nThe differences between components of distributable earnings on a tax basis and the amounts reflected in the consolidated\nstatement of changes in net assets are primarily due to temporary book-tax differences that will reverse in subsequent periods.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Corporation had a net capital loss carry forward of $1,546,597, which is considered long-term.\nThis loss may be carried forward indefinitely.\n2 The Corporation’s taxable income for 2023 is an estimate and will not be finalized until the Corporation files its 2023 federal income\ntax returns in 2024. Therefore, the Corporation’s actual taxable income and the Corporation’s actual taxable income that was earned\nin 2023 and carried forward for distribution in 2024 may be different than this estimate.\n83\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe Corporation had the following wholly-owned blocker companies in place at December 31, 2023: Rand BMP Swanson\nHoldings Corp., Rand Carolina Skiff Holdings Corp., Rand DSD Holdings Corp., Rand Filterworks Holdings Corp., Rand FSS\nHoldings Corp., Rand INEA Holdings Corp., Rand ITA Holdings Corp., and Rand Somerset Holdings Corp. (the “Blocker Corps”),\nwhich are taxable entities and therefore are not consolidated for tax purposes. The primary purpose of the Blocker Corps is to permit\nthe Corporation to hold certain equity interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or\nother forms of pass-through entities), and still allow the Corporation to satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90% of its gross\nincome for U.S. federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. The Blocker Corps are taxed at standard\ncorporate tax rates based on their taxable income.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $39,179 that primarily related to net operating loss\ncarryforwards, business interest expense carryforwards, and capital loss carryforwards within the Blocker Corps. At December 31,\n2022, the Corporation had a net deferred tax asset of $28,160 that primarily related to unrealized appreciation on investments held in\nthe Blocker Corps.\nIncome Taxes on Blocker Corporations\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of\nassets and liabilities using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.\nThe tax effect of the major temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to the Corporation’s net deferred tax asset\nat December 31, 2023 and 2022 are approximately as follows:\n2023 2022\nInvestments $ (644,497) $ (234,730)\nNOL & tax credit carryforwards 683,676 262,890\nDeferred tax asset, net $ 39,179 $ 28,160\nThe major temporary differences cited above include differences in the book and tax bases of the Corporation’s portfolio\ncompany investments, as well as unrealized gains and losses on corporate investments that will be taxed when realized in future years.\nThe Corporation assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets annually to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary. The\nCorporation records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets if and to the extent it is more likely than not that the\nCorporation will not recover the deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Corporation weights all\nrelevant positive and negative evidence, and considers among other factors, historical financial performance, projected future taxable\nincome, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, and tax planning strategies. Changes in\ncircumstances, including the Blocker Corps generating significant taxable income and tax planning strategies, could cause a change in\njudgment about the need for a valuation allowance of the related deferred tax assets. Any change in the valuation allowance will be\nincluded in income in the period of the change in estimate.\nAccordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Corporation estimated that a portion of its Blocker Corps’\ndeferred tax assets, related to a capital loss realized in 2023, is not expected to be fully recoverable in the future. As a result, the\nCorporation recorded a partial valuation allowance of approximately $131,000 during the year ended December 31, 2023 against its\nU.S. Federal deferred tax assets. There was no valuation allowance prior to this date.\n84\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) reported in the consolidated statements of operations are as follows for the\nyears ended December 31:\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 609,056 $ 173,235 $ 85,829\nState 58,320 (2,555) 14,835\n667,376 170,680 100,664\nDeferred:\nFederal (13,797) 92,304 (279,167)\nState 2,778 60,538 (22,977)\n(11,019) 152,842 (302,144)\nTotal $ 656,357 $ 323,522 $ (201,480)\nA reconciliation of the expense (benefit) from income taxes at the federal statutory rate to the expense reported is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nNet investment income (loss), realized gain (loss) and unrealized\ngain (loss) before income taxes $ 7,183,007 $ (558,327) $ 15,595,948\nExpected tax expense (benefit) at statutory rate 1,508,431 (117,249) 3,275,149\nState - net of federal effect 48,267 45,807 (8,142)\nPass-through expense (benefit) from portfolio investment 487 721 (46,210)\nValuation allowance 131,338 — —\nTax benefit of RIC status (1,067,238) 400,329 (3,426,735)\nRIC excise tax expense 52,800 — —\nOther (17,728) (6,086) 4,458\nTotal $ 656,357 $ 323,522 $ (201,480)\nAt December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation had $2,244,664, and $955,952, respectively, of federal net operating loss\ncarryforwards, $766,621 and $291,416, respectively, of business interest expense carryforwards and $625,419 and $0, respectively, of\ncapital loss carryforwards. For state tax purposes, there were various state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $1,957,489 and\n$567,127 at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nUnder the provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), net operating loss and credit carryforwards and\nother tax attributes may be subject to limitations if there has been a significant change in ownership in the Corporation, as defined by\nthe IRC. Prior to the completion of the transaction with East in November 2019, the Corporation was able to utilize the remaining\nfederal net operating losses. However, state net operating losses may be subject to similar limitations.\nThe Corporation is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the Internal Revenue Service for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020 through 2023. In general, the Corporation’s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of\nlimitations for the years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023.\nIt is the Corporation’s policy to include interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities in income tax expense on the\nStatement of Operations. In addition, the Corporation records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes”,\n(“ASC 740”). ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed\nin the financial statements. The uncertain tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were de minimis. No\namounts were recorded for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 and $2,627 was recorded in interest for the year ended December 31, 2021 for a late payment of federal taxes owing. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2022, the Corporation received $10,116 in interest income relating to an IRS carryback claim.\nNOTE 5. – SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\nOn June 27, 2022, the Corporation entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with M&T Bank, as lender (the\n“Lender”), which provides the Corporation with a senior secured revolving credit facility in a principal amount not to exceed $25.0\nmillion (the “Credit Facility”). The amount the Corporation can borrow, at any given time, under the Credit Facility is tied to a\n85\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nborrowing base, which is measured as (i) 75% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of the publicly traded equity securities\nheld (other than shares of ACV Auctions) plus (ii) the least of (a) 75% of the fair market value of the shares of ACV Auctions held,\n(b) $6.25 million and (c) 25% of the aggregate borrowing base availability for the Credit Facility at any date of determination plus (iii)\n50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of eligible private loans held that meet specified criteria plus (iv) the lesser of (a)\n50% of the aggregate sum of the fair market values of unsecured private loans held that meet specified criteria and (b) $1.25 million\nminus (v) such reserves as the Lender may establish from time to time in its sole discretion. The Credit Facility has a maturity date of\nJune 27, 2027. Under the borrowing base formula described above, the unused line of credit balance for the Credit Facility was\n$8,750,000 at December 31, 2023.\nThe Corporation’s borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate determined as a rate per annum equal\nto 3.50 percentage points above the greater of (i) the applicable daily simple secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) and (ii) 0.25%.\nAt December 31, 2023, the Corporation's applicable interest rate was 8.88%. In addition, under the terms of the Credit Facility, the\nCorporation has also agreed to pay the Lender an unused commitment fee on a quarterly basis, computed as 0.30% multiplied by the\naverage daily Unused Commitment Fee Base (which is defined as the difference between (i) $25.0 million and (ii) the sum of the\naggregate principal amount of the Corporation’s outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility) for the preceding quarter.\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants usual and\ncustomary for agreements of this type, including among others, covenants that prohibit, subject to certain specified exceptions, the\nCorporation’s ability to merge or consolidate with other companies, sell any material part of the Corporation’s assets, incur other\nindebtedness, incur liens on the Corporation’s assets, make investments or loans to third parties other than permitted investments and\npermitted loans, and declare any distribution or dividend other than certain permitted distributions.

The Security Agreement\nsecures all of the Corporation’s obligations to the Lender, including, without limitation, principal and interest on the Credit Facility\nand any fees and charges. The security interest granted under the Security Agreement covers all of the Corporation’s personal property\nincluding, among other things, all accounts, chattel paper, investment property, deposit accounts, general intangibles, inventory, and\nall of the fixtures. The Security Agreement contains various representations, warranties, covenants and agreements customary in\nsecurity agreements and various events of default with remedies under the New York Uniform Commercial Code and the Security\nAgreement. Events of default under the Security Agreement, which permit the Lender to exercise its various remedies, are similar to\nthose contained in the Credit Agreement.\nThe outstanding balance drawn on the Credit Facility at was $16,250,000 and $2,550,000 at December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. A closing fee of $125,000 was paid related to the closing of this Credit Facility during the year\nended December 31, 2022.

Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Corporation pays RCM, as compensation for the\ninvestment advisory and management services, fees consisting of two components: (i) the Base Management Fee and (ii) the Incentive\nFee.\nThe “Base Management Fee” is calculated at an annual rate of 1.50% of the Corporation’s total assets (other than cash or\ncash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds). For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the\nBase Management Fees earned by RCM were $1,057,166, $927,226 and $858,144, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nthe Corporation had $287,297 and $230,221, respectively, payable for the Base Management Fees, and it is included in the \"Due to\ninvestment adviser\" line on the Corporation's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nThe “Incentive Fee” is comprised of two parts: (1) the “Income Based Fee” and (2) the “Capital Gains Fee”. The Income\nBased Fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the “Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income” (as defined in the\nagreement) for the immediately preceding calendar quarter.\nThe Corporation pays RCM an Incentive Fee with respect to its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in each calendar\nquarter as follows:\n(i) no Income Based Fee in any quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such quarter does not\nexceed the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00% annualized);\n(ii) 100% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion of the Pre-\nIncentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate of 1.75% (7.00%\nannualized) but is less than 2.1875% (8.75% annualized); and\n(iii) 20% of the amount of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for any calendar quarter with respect to that portion\nof the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for such calendar quarter, if any, that exceeds 2.1875% (8.75%\nannualized).\nThe Income Based Fee paid to RCM shall not be in excess of the Incentive Fee Cap. The “Incentive Fee Cap” for any quarter\nis an amount equal to (1) 20.0% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation\nPeriod (as defined below) minus (2) the aggregate Income Based Fee that was paid in respect of the calendar quarters included in the\nrelevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period.\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Income Based Fee Calculation Period” is defined as, with\nreference to a calendar quarter, the period of time consisting of such calendar quarter and the additional quarters that comprise the\neleven calendar quarters immediately preceding such calendar quarter.\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Cumulative Net Return” is defined as (1) the aggregate net\ninvestment income in respect of the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period minus (2) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect\nof the relevant Income Based Fee Calculation Period. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the\nCorporation pays no Income Based Fee to RCM for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive\nvalue but is less than the Income Based Fee that is payable to RCM for such quarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap)\ncalculated as described above, the Corporation pays an Income Based Fee to RCM equal to the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If,\nin any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the Income Based Fee that is payable to RCM for such\nquarter (before giving effect to the Incentive Fee Cap) calculated as described above, the Corporation pays an Income Based Fee to the\nAdviser equal to the Income Based Fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.\nFor purposes of the calculation of the Income Based Fee, “Net Capital Loss,” in respect of a particular period, means the\ndifference, if positive, between (1) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (2) aggregate capital\ngains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.\n89\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAny Income Based Fee otherwise payable under the Investment Management Agreement with respect to Accrued Unpaid\nIncome (such fees being the “Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees”) shall be deferred, on a security by security basis, and shall\nbecome payable to RCM only if, as, when and to the extent cash is received by us in respect of any Accrued Unpaid Income. Any\nAccrued Unpaid Income that is subsequently reversed by us in connection with a write-down, write-off, impairment or similar\ntreatment of the investment giving rise to such Accrued Unpaid Income will, in the applicable period of reversal, (1) reduce Pre-\nIncentive Fee Net Investment Income and (2) reduce the amount of Accrued Unpaid Income Based Fees. Subsequent payments of\nAccrued Unpaid Income Based Fees deferred pursuant to this paragraph shall not reduce the amounts otherwise payable for any\nquarter as an Income Based Fee.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no Income Based Fees earned under the Investment\nManagement Agreement.\nThe second part of the Incentive Fee is the “Capital Gains Fee”. This fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of\neach calendar year. Under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement, the Capital Gains Fee is calculated at the end of each\napplicable year by subtracting (1) the sum of the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital\ndepreciation from (2) the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, in each case calculated from November 8, 2019. If this amount\nis positive at the end of any calendar year, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the\ncumulative aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains\nFee payable for that calendar year. If the Investment Management Agreement is terminated as of a date that is not a calendar year end,\nthe termination date shall be treated as though it were a calendar year end for purposes of calculating and paying the Capital Gains\nFee.\nFor purposes of the Capital Gains Fee:\n• The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the\nnet sales price of each investment in the Corporations portfolio when sold minus (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis\nof such investment.\n• The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price\nof each investment in the portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\n• The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the amount, if negative, between (a) the\nvaluation of each investment in the portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date minus (b) the\naccreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Corporation recorded Capital Gains Fees payable of $692,000,\n$332,000 and $652,240, respectively. The Capital Gains Fee expense is recorded in the “Capital gains incentive fees” line on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and the current amount payable is included in the “Due to investment adviser” line on the\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nFor purposes of calculating the amount of the capital gains incentive fee accrual to be included as part of a company’s\nfinancial statements, GAAP requires a company to consider, as part of such calculation, the amount of cumulative aggregate\nunrealized capital appreciation that such company has with respect to its investments. As a result, the capital gains incentive fee\naccrual under GAAP is calculated using the both the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and losses and the aggregate net\nchange in unrealized capital appreciation/depreciation at the close of the period. If the calculated amount is positive, GAAP requires\nthe Corporation to record a capital gains incentive fee accrual equal to 20% of this cumulative amount, less the aggregate amount of\nactual capital gains incentive fees paid, or capital gains incentive fees accrued under GAAP, for all prior periods. However,\nunrealized capital appreciation is not used by the Corporation as part of the calculation to determine the amount of the Capital Gains\nFee actually payable to RCM under the terms of the Investment Management Agreement.. There can be no assurance that such\nunrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Corporation\nrecorded an accrual of capital gains incentive fees, in accordance with GAAP, of $2,279,700 and $2,167,000, respectively. The\naccrued capital gains incentive fees are recorded in the line item “Capital gains incentive fees” on the Consolidated Statements of\nFinancial Position. The expense related to the accrued capital gains incentive fee was $804,700, ($1,048,760) and $4,200,000 for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively and is recorded on the “Capital gains incentive fees” line on the\nConsolidated Statements of Operations.\n90\nRAND CAPITAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\nAdministration Agreement\nUnder the terms of the Administration Agreement, RCM agreed to perform (or oversee, or arrange for, the performance of)\nthe administrative services necessary for the Corporation’s operations, including, but not limited to, office facilities, equipment,\nclerical, bookkeeping, finance, accounting, compliance and record keeping services at such office facilities and such other services as\nRCM, subject to review by the Corporation’s Board of Directors, will from time to time determine to be necessary or useful to\nperform its obligations under the Administration Agreement.

There were no administrative fees incurred during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 or 2021.\nNOTE 11. – SUBSEQUENT EVENT\nSubsequent to year end, on February 26, 2024, Rand’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per\nshare.

In our opinion, the financial statements and\nfinancial highlights schedule present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rand Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements and the financial highlights schedule are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements and financial highlights schedule based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights schedule are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation's internal control over financial\nreporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements and financial\nhighlights schedule, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights schedule.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the financial statements and financial highlights schedule. Our procedures included confirmation of\ninvestments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, by correspondence with portfolio companies and custodian(s); or by other appropriate\naudit procedures when replies were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nThe supplemental schedule of consolidated changes in investments at cost and realized gain for the year ended December 31,\n2023 has been subjected to audit procedures performed in conjunction with the audit of the Corporation's financial statements. The\nsupplemental schedule is the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our audit procedures included determining whether the\nsupplemental schedule reconciles to the financial statements or the underlying accounting and other records, as applicable and\nperforming procedures to test the completeness and accuracy of the information presented in the supplemental schedule. In forming our\nopinion on the supplemental schedule, we evaluated whether the supplemental schedule, including its form and content, is presented in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplemental schedule of\nconsolidated changes in investments at cost and realized gain for the year ended December 31, 2023 is fairly stated, in all material\nrespects, in relation to the financial statements as a whole.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material\nto the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a\nwhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n93\nFair-Value – Level 3 Investments\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAt December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Corporation’s investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the fair value\nhierarchy (Level 3 investments) totaled $69,816,062. Management determines the fair value of the Corporation’s Level 3 investments\nby applying the methodologies outlined in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements and using significant unobservable inputs and\nassumptions. Determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments requires management to make judgments about the valuation\nmethodologies and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions including, among others, EBITDA multiples and revenue multiples,\nused in determining the fair value measurements.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nAuditing the fair value of the Corporation’s Level 3 investments was complex, as the unobservable inputs and assumptions\nused by the Corporation are highly judgmental, are sensitive to economic factors, and could have a significant effect on the fair value\nmeasurement of such investments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, obtaining an understanding and evaluated the design of controls over the\nCorporation’s investment valuation process, evaluating the Corporation’s valuation methodologies, testing the significant unobservable\ninputs and assumptions used by the Corporation in determining the fair value of the Corporation’s Level 3 investments, and testing the\nmathematical accuracy of the Corporation’s valuation calculations. For Level 3 investments, we reviewed the information considered\nby the Board of Directors relating to the Corporation’s determination of fair value. For a selection of the Corporation’s Level 3\ninvestments, we independently developed fair value estimates and compared them to the Corporation’s estimates. We developed our\nindependent fair value estimates by using the respective investments financial information, which we compared to underlying source\ndocuments provided to the Corporation by the investment, and available market information from third-party sources, such as market\nmultiples. We also evaluated subsequent events and other available information and considered whether they corroborated or\ncontradicted the Corporation’s year-end valuations.\n/s/ FREED MAXICK CPAs, P.C.\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 2003.\nBuffalo, New York\nMarch 5, 2024\n94\nItem 9.

To ratify the selection of Freed Maxick CPAs, P.C. as our independent registered public accounting firm for\nthe year ending December 31, 2024.\n3. To consider and act upon such other business as may properly come before the meeting.\nShareholders of record at the close of business on March 20, 2024 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the annual\nmeeting, and any adjournment thereof.\nApril 1, 2024 By order of the Board of Directors,\nBuffalo, New York\n/s/ Margaret W. Brechtel\nMargaret W. Brechtel\nExecutive Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary\nIMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING\nINTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS\nFOR THE ANNUAL MEETING TO BE HELD ON\nMay 7, 2024\nTHE PROXY STATEMENT AND ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS\nIS AVAILABLE AT: WWW.PROXYVOTE.COM\nRand Capital Corporation\n14 Lafayette Square, Suite 1405\nBuffalo, New York 14203\nProxy Statement\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nWe are furnishing this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the\n“Board”) of Rand Capital Corporation (“Rand” or the “Corporation” or “we”) for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be\nheld on May 7, 2024 (“Annual Meeting”) at 10:30 a.m., local time, virtually via the internet at\nwww.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RAND2024. This Proxy Statement and accompanying form of proxy are first being\nmailed to shareholders on or about April 1, 2024. A copy of Rand’s annual report, which contains Rand’s financial statements,\naccompanies this Proxy Statement.\nOnly shareholders of record at the close of business on March 20, 2024 (“Record Date”) are entitled to notice of and\nto vote at the Annual Meeting, and at any adjournment thereof. On the Record Date, Rand had 2,581,021 shares of common\nstock, par value $0.10 per share (“shares”), issued, outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.\nEach share entitles the holder to one vote. Shares cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless the shareholder is\npresent or represented by proxy. If the enclosed form of proxy is returned properly executed and dated, the shares represented\nthereby will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy, unless the proxy is\nrevoked prior to its exercise or a subsequently dated proxy is executed and submitted. If you authorize a proxy without\nindicating your voting instructions, the proxyholder will vote your shares “FOR” each of the Directors standing for election in\nProposal 1 and “FOR” Proposal 2 (Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm).\nAny shareholder may revoke a proxy by executing a subsequently dated proxy or a notice of revocation, provided that\nthe subsequent proxy or notice is delivered to the Corporation prior to the taking of a vote, or by voting at the Annual Meeting.\nIf you hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must follow the instructions you receive from them in order\nto revoke your voting instructions. Attending the Annual Meeting virtually does not revoke your proxy unless you also vote\nelectronically at the Annual Meeting.\nUnder the New York Business Corporation Law (the “BCL”) and the Corporation’s by-laws, the presence, in person\nor by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is necessary to\nconstitute a quorum of the shareholders to take action at the Annual Meeting. The shares that are present at the Annual Meeting\nor represented by a proxy will be counted for quorum purposes. Proxies submitted with abstentions and broker non-votes will\nbe counted in determining whether or not a quorum is present. Under the BCL and the Corporation’s by-laws, once a quorum\nis established, Directors standing for election pursuant to Proposal 1 (Election of Directors) are to be elected by a plurality of\nthe votes cast (meaning that the Director nominees who receive the highest number of shares voted “for” their election are\nelected), and Proposal 2 (Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) is to be\napproved by a majority of votes cast in favor of the matter (meaning that the number of shares voted “for” a proposal must\nexceed the number of shares voted “against” such proposal). With respect to the Election of Directors (Proposal 1), you may\nvote “for” or “withhold” authority to vote for each of the nominees for the Board. With respect to Proposal 2, you may vote\n“for,” “against” or “abstain” from voting on this proposal. Votes withheld, broker non-votes, and abstentions will not be counted\nas votes cast on a proposal, and will have no effect on the results of the vote of such proposal. A broker non-vote occurs when\na bank, broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker\ndoes not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions on how to vote from the\nbeneficial owner. Brokers, banks and other nominees have discretionary authority to vote on “routine” matters, but not on “non-\nroutine” matters. Proposal 1 (Election of Directors) is considered a non-routine matter, whereas Proposal 2 (Ratification of the\nAppointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) is a routine matter. If you hold your shares in street name\n(or “nominee name”) and do not provide your broker, bank or other nominee who holds these shares of record with specific\ninstructions regarding how to vote on Proposal 1, your bank, broker or other nominee may not be permitted to vote your shares\non Proposal 1 with respect to the election of Directors. Please instruct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote so\nyour vote can be counted.\nProxy 1\nWe will bear all costs of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. We may pay brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and\nother custodians their reasonable fees and expenses for sending proxy materials to beneficial owners and obtaining their\ninstructions. In addition to solicitation by mail, our Directors, our officers and the employees of Rand Capital Management\nLLC, the Corporation’s external investment adviser (“RCM”), may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, and they will\nreceive no additional compensation therefor.\nOur office is located at 14 Lafayette Square, Suite 1405, Buffalo, New York 14203, and our telephone number is 716-\n853-0802.\nEXPLANATORY NOTE REGARDING THE EXTERNALIZATION\nOn November 8, 2019, the Corporation entered into an investment advisory and management agreement and an\nadministration agreement with RCM whereby RCM agreed to provide investment advisory, management and administration\nservices to the Corporation (the “Externalization”). Following the Externalization, the Corporation’s prior employees, including\nits Chief Executive Officer/President and Chief Financial Officer, became employees of RCM and no longer receive any direct\ncompensation from the Corporation. The Corporation’s day-to-day investment operations are managed by RCM and services\nnecessary for its business, including the origination and administration of its investment portfolio, are provided by individuals\nwho are employees of RCM.\nAs a result of the foregoing, RCM currently acts as the Corporation’s investment adviser and administrator pursuant\nto the terms of an investment advisory and management agreement (the “Advisory Agreement”) and an administration\nagreement (the “Administration Agreement”). As described in greater detail in the Corporation’s Annual Report on Form 10-\nK under Part I, Item 1 “Business ‒ Investment Advisory and Management Agreement,” the compensation paid by the\nCorporation to RCM for providing investment advisory and management services under the Advisory Agreement consists of\ntwo components — (i) a base management fee and (ii) an incentive fee consisting of two parts: (A) an income based fee and\n(B) a capital gains based fee. In addition, the Corporation reimburses RCM for the Corporation’s allocable portion of expenses\nincurred by RCM in performing administrative obligations and functions for the Corporation under the Administration\nAgreement. The address for RCM is 14 Lafayette Square, Suite 1405, Buffalo, New York 14203.\nVIRTUAL MEETING INFORMATION\nConsistent with our approach at last year’s annual meeting of shareholders, the Annual Meeting will be held virtually\nvia the internet at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RAND2024. We have structured the Annual Meeting to provide\nshareholders with the same rights as if they participated in person, including the ability to vote shares electronically during the\nAnnual Meeting and ask questions in accordance with the rules of conduct for the Annual Meeting.\nTo participate virtually in the Annual Meeting, you will need your 16-digit control number included in your proxy\nmaterials or voting instruction form. The Annual Meeting will begin promptly at 10:30 a.m., local time, on May 7, 2024. We\nrecommend that you log in at least 15 minutes before the Annual Meeting begins to ensure ample time to complete the check-\nin procedures and test your computer audio system. If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting platform\nduring check-in or during the Annual Meeting, please call the technical support number that will be posted on the virtual\nmeeting platform login page at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RAND2024.\nYou can submit questions by logging into www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/RAND2024 with your 16-digit\ncontrol number. Additional information regarding the rules and procedures for asking questions during the Annual Meeting\nwill be provided in our rules of conduct, which shareholders can view on the virtual meeting platform.\nYou will also be permitted to vote through the virtual meeting platform using your 16-digit control number. If you\nhold your shares in a brokerage account or through a bank or another nominee, since you are not the shareholder of record, in\norder to vote these shares electronically at the Annual Meeting you must obtain and submit a legal proxy from your bank,\nbroker or other nominee through the virtual meeting platform.\nProxy 2\nBENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SHARES\nUnless otherwise indicated, the following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our shares of common stock on\nMarch 20, 2024, by (a) persons known by us to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common\nstock, (b) the Directors, the nominees for Director and the executive officers of Rand, and (c) all current Directors and executive\nofficers as a group.

Mr. Gusky disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares of common stock owned by East.\n(4) Except as noted in footnotes 2 and 3 above with respect to Mr. Kailbourne and Mr. Gusky, respectively, members of the\ngroup have sole voting and investment power over their respective shares.\n(5) Percent of Class calculated based on 2,581,021 shares issued and outstanding at the Record Date.\nProxy 3\nDELINQUENT SECTION 16(a) REPORTS\nDuring 2023, the executive officers and Directors of the Corporation and owners of more than 10% of the outstanding\ncommon stock of the Corporation timely filed with the SEC the required reports under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) regarding their beneficial ownership of the Corporation’s common stock. As a\npractical matter, the Corporation assists its executive officers and Directors by monitoring transactions and assisting with the\ncompletion and filing of Section 16 reports on their behalf.\nPROPOSAL 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nFive Directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting. All five of the Director nominees, Messrs. Godley, Gusky,\nKailbourne and Zak and Ms. Jaroslawsky, were elected at the last annual meeting of shareholders held in April 2023. Messrs.\nGusky and Godley were each designated for nomination for election to the Board by East pursuant to the terms of that certain\nshareholder agreement, dated as of November 8, 2019, by and between Rand and East (the “Shareholder Agreement”). For\nadditional information on the terms of the Shareholder Agreement with East, see the description included in “Nomination of\nDirectors” below.\nEach of the nominees, including Messrs. Gusky and Godley that were designated for nomination by East under the\nterms of the Shareholder Agreement, was recommended for nomination for election by the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee, which is comprised solely of Independent Directors, and was nominated for election by the full Board. Each of the\nnominees has consented to serve as a Director if elected. If, at the time of the Annual Meeting, any nominee should be unable\nto serve, it is the intention of the persons designated as proxies to vote, in their discretion, for such other person as may be\ndesignated as a nominee by the Board.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board has affirmatively determined that the following current Directors, each of whom is also a Director nominee\nfor the Annual Meeting, are “Independent Directors” under the rules of the SEC and under the rules and guidelines of the\nNasdaq Stock Market: Benjamin E. Godley, Cari L. Jaroslawsky, Erland E. Kailbourne and Robert M. Zak. The Board applies\nthe standards of the SEC and the rules and guidelines of the Nasdaq Stock Market to assist it in making director independence\ndeterminations. The Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether a material relationship\nbetween Rand and a Director exists that would interfere with that Director’s exercise of independent judgment in fulfilling his\nor her responsibilities as a Director. In making this determination, the Board considered the analysis and recommendations of\nthe Governance and Nominating Committee, as well as any related person transactions and other relationships with the\nCorporation or RCM. Material relationships that the Board may consider include commercial, consulting, legal, accounting,\nindustrial, charitable and family relationships.\nThe nominees for election as a Director at the Annual Meeting have been nominated by the Board upon the\nrecommendation of the Board’s Governance and Nominating Committee, which is comprised solely of Independent Directors\nin compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(e)(1).\nAdam S. Gusky, a current Director and a Director nominee, has been determined to be an “interested person” under\nSection 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) with respect to Rand. Directors who\nare determined to be interested persons do not qualify as Independent Directors under the rules and guidelines of the Nasdaq\nStock Market.\nThe Board, with reference to the SEC rules and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules and guidelines, has also determined\nthat:\n● each member that served on the Audit Committee and the Governance and Nominating Committee during 2023\nwas independent under the applicable Nasdaq Stock Market rules and guidelines and SEC rules for purposes of\ndetermining independence of the members of each of those committees; and\n● each member that served on the Audit Committee during 2023 also met the additional independence requirements\nunder Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A).\nProxy 4\nRand’s Board Chair, Mr. Zak, served as chair of the “executive sessions” of the Independent Directors of the Board\nduring 2023. These “executive sessions” occurred at least twice during 2023. The Corporation also held separate committee\nmeetings of the Board during 2023, which committees were comprised solely of Independent Directors.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Board monitors and performs an oversight role with respect to the Corporation’s business and affairs, including\nwith respect to valuation of the Corporation’s investments, investment practices and performance, compliance with regulatory\nrequirements, including applicable requirements of the 1940 Act, cybersecurity, and the services, expenses and performance\nof service providers. Among other things, the Board approves the appointment of the Corporation’s investment adviser and\nadministrator and the Corporation’s entry into or renewal of the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement,\nreviews and monitors the services and activities performed by the Corporation’s investment adviser and officers, and approves\nthe engagement of the Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Corporation believes that board leadership structures must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that its\nexisting board leadership structure is appropriate and serves the Corporation and its shareholders well. Robert M. Zak, who\nserved as Chair of the Board during 2023, is not an “interested person” under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act with respect to\nRand. Daniel P. Penberthy, who is not a Director of the Corporation, served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the\nCorporation during 2023. The Corporation believes that separating the Board Chair and President/Chief Executive Officer roles\nprovides independent oversight of the Corporation, enhanced leadership by the Independent Directors, and a check on the Chief\nExecutive Officer/President and Chief Financial Officer of the Corporation, who are also employees of RCM. However, the\nCorporation re-examines its approach as to corporate governance matters on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to\nmeet the Corporation’s needs and are in the best interests of shareholders.\nThe Board’s Role in Risk Oversight\nThe Board’s role in the Corporation’s risk oversight process includes receiving and reviewing regular reports from\nthe officers of the Corporation and RCM, including reports prepared by their respective Chief Compliance Officers, on areas\nof material risk to the Corporation, including portfolio valuation, operational, financial, cybersecurity, legal, regulatory and\ncompliance, strategic and reputational risks and compliance by the Corporation with its compliance policies and procedures.\nThe full Board (or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) reviews\nthese reports from the officers of the Corporation and RCM to understand and provide oversight and direction on the\nmanagement of these risks.\nAs described in more detail below under “Audit Committee” and “Governance and Nominating Committee,” the Audit\nCommittee and the Governance and Nominating Committee assist the Board in performing its risk oversight function and\nfulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee’s risk oversight responsibilities include overseeing the\nCorporation’s accounting and financial reporting processes, assisting the Board in fulfilling the Board’s oversight\nresponsibilities relating to the Corporation’s systems of internal controls over financial reporting, overseeing audits of the\nCorporation’s financial statements, and discussing the Corporation’s major financial risk exposures with the officers of the\nCorporation and the steps that these officers have taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Governance and\nNominating Committee’s risk oversight responsibilities include identifying, evaluating and nominating Directors to fill\nvacancies on the Board or to stand for election by the Corporation’s shareholders, and reviewing the Corporation’s policies and\npractices relating to corporate governance. The full Board is charged with oversight of risks relating to cybersecurity matters\nfor the Corporation and receives reports from officers of the Corporation on cybersecurity matters applicable to the Corporation.\nIn addition, the Board also performs its risk oversight responsibilities with the assistance of the Corporation’s Chief\nCompliance Officer and RCM’s Chief Compliance Officer to monitor compliance-related risks in accordance with the\nCorporation’s and RCM’s compliance policies and procedures. The Board receives and reviews quarterly written reports from\nthe Corporation’s Chief Compliance Officer and RCM’s Chief Compliance Officer at its regular Board meetings, which\nquarterly reports discuss, among other items, the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of the\nCorporation and RCM and any compliance-related events that may have occurred during the prior quarter. Annual reports\nprovided by the Corporation’s Chief Compliance Officer and RCM’s Chief Compliance Officer address: (i) the operation of\nthe compliance policies and procedures of the Corporation and RCM since the date of the last annual report; (ii) any material\nchanges to such policies and procedures since the date of the last annual report; (iii) any recommendations for material changes\nto such policies and procedures as a result of an annual review; and (iv) any compliance matter that has occurred since the date\nof the last annual report as to which the Board would reasonably need to know to oversee compliance. The Corporation’s Chief\nCompliance Officer also meets separately in executive session with only the Independent Directors present periodically, but in\nno event less than once each year.\nProxy 5\nWe believe that the Board’s role in risk oversight is effective and appropriate given the extensive regulation to which the\nCorporation is subject as a business development company (“BDC”). Specifically, as a BDC, the Corporation must comply\nwith numerous regulatory requirements that control the level of risk in our business and operations, including limitations under\nthe 1940 Act on the amount of borrowings or debt securities we may incur or issue. In addition, we generally have to invest at\nleast 70% of our total assets in “qualifying assets” and, subject to certain exceptions, we generally are not permitted to invest\nin any portfolio company in which our affiliates currently have an investment. Finally, we have elected to be treated as a\nregulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).\nAs a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source of income, asset diversification and distribution requirements.\nThe Corporation believes that the extent of the Board’s (and its committees’) role in risk oversight complements the\nBoard’s leadership structure because it allows the Corporation’s Independent Directors, through the two fully independent\nBoard committees, an independent Board Chair, executive sessions with each of the Corporation’s Chief Compliance Officer\nand the Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm, to exercise oversight of risk without any conflict that\nmight discourage critical review.\nThe Corporation believes that board roles in risk oversight must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and that the Board’s\nexisting role in risk oversight is appropriate. However, the Board re-examines the manner in which it administers its risk\noversight function on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to be effective and meet the Corporation’s needs.\nInformation Regarding Directors, Nominees for Director, and Executive Officers\nThe following table provides information concerning all persons who are nominees for Director or executive officers\nof Rand.\nNumber of\nLength of Portfolios in the\nTime Fund Complex\nPosition(s) Served Overseen by the Other\nName, Age and held with as a Business Experience and Occupations Director or Director Director-\nAddress Fund Director (1) During Last Five Years Nominee ships (2)\nDirectors and\nDirector Nominees\nwho are Interested\nPersons\nAdam S.

Godley (Chair) Erland E. Kailbourne (Chair)\nErland E. Kailbourne Benjamin E. Godley\nCari L. Jaroslawsky Cari L. Jaroslawsky\nRobert M. Zak Robert M. Zak\nAs described in greater detail below under “Compensation Committee,” after the Corporation’s 2019 annual meeting\nof shareholders and the completion of the Externalization, (i) consistent with the requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules,\ngiven the Corporation’s status as a “controlled company” and (ii) given that all of the Corporation’s prior employees, including\nits Chief Executive Officer/President and Chief Financial Officer, became employees of RCM and do not receive any direct\ncompensation from the Corporation, the Board determined that it was no longer necessary to establish and retain a standing\nCompensation Committee.\nDuring 2023, the full Board met eight times, the Audit Committee met five times, and the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee met two times. During 2023, each Director attended 100% of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the\ncommittees of which such Director was a member.\nCompensation Committee\nAs of the Record Date, East owns approximately 64.2% of our outstanding shares. As a result of East’s percentage of\nownership of our shares, the Corporation qualifies as a “controlled company” under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5615(c), and therefore\nis permitted to avail itself of the exemptions under the Nasdaq Listing Rules afforded to a “controlled company.” Pursuant to\nthe Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Corporation, as a “controlled company,” is exempt from the requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule\n5605(d) with respect to the need to have a standing and fully independent compensation committee. Given, upon the completion\nof the Externalization, the Corporation does not have any employees and the employees of RCM do not receive any direct\ncompensation from the Corporation, the Board determined after the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders that it was no longer\nnecessary or useful to establish and retain a standing Compensation Committee. Any functions previously performed by the\nCompensation Committee that are still applicable for the Corporation after the completion of the Externalization are now\nperformed by the Governance and Nominating Committee. Given the Board’s focus on good corporate governance, at this\ntime, the Board has decided not to avail itself of any of the other exemptions that are permitted to be used by a “controlled\ncompany” under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nProxy 12\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNo interlocking relationship, as defined by the rules adopted by the SEC, existed during the year ended December 31,\n2023 between any member of the Board and an executive officer of the Corporation.\nGovernance and Nominating Committee\nThe primary purposes of the Governance and Nominating Committee include:\n● monitoring, developing, recommending to the Board and assessing policies and practices relating to corporate\ngovernance for Rand, including identifying best practices and reviewing and recommending to the Board for\napproval any changes to the documents, policies and procedures in the Corporation’s corporate governance\nframework;\n● reviewing and making recommendations to the full Board regarding the amount and type of compensation\nthat is to be paid to the non-employee Directors, including for service on the Board’s committees;\n● reviewing membership of the Board’s committees and recommending to the Board which Directors should\nbe appointed to such committees and their respective chairs;\n● establishing criteria for Board membership and evaluating the desirability of changes in the size and\ncomposition of the Board;\n● coordinating discussions among Directors regarding Board performance and committee performance;\n● reviewing executive officer succession plans;\n● identifying and evaluating potential Board candidates and establishing criteria for Board membership; and\n● recommending to the Board individuals to be nominated by the Board for election by the Corporation’s\nshareholders at each annual meeting of shareholders, and recommending to the Board candidates to fill\nvacancies on the Board and the size of the Board.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee’s charter may be accessed at Rand’s website, www.randcapital.com.\nNone of the persons that served on the Governance and Nominating Committee during 2023 were “interested persons” as\ndefined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Each member of the Governance and Nominating Committee during 2023 met the\nindependence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nNomination of Directors\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee, as part of its responsibilities under its charter, oversees the identification\nof qualified individuals to serve on the Board.\nWe seek Directors who have the required and appropriate skills and characteristics, including business experience and\npersonal skills in finance, marketing, business and other areas that are necessary to contribute to an effective Board. We identify\nnew Director candidates from prominent businesspersons and professionals in the communities Rand serves or who have a\nshared interest in the types of investments in which Rand transacts. We consider nominees of shareholders in the same manner\nas other nominees.\nIf a vacancy occurs on the Board, or if the size of the Board is changed, the Governance and Nominating Committee\nmay, in compliance with the requirements of the Shareholder Agreement described below, recommend candidates to the Board\nfor election. The Board may elect a new Director to fill any unexpired term of the seat. Annually, the Governance and\nNominating Committee will recommend a slate of new and/or continuing candidates for nomination for election to the Board.\nThe Board will select and approve a slate of nominees for Director from recommendations of the Governance and Nominating\nCommittee, and submit the slate of nominees to be voted on by shareholders at Rand’s next annual meeting of shareholders.\nThe number of Directors on the Board is determined by the Board, but in no event may it be fewer than three Directors.\nProxy 13\nPursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement, East has the right to designate two or three persons, depending\nupon the size of the Board, for nomination for election to the Board. East will have the right to designate (i) up to two persons\nif the size of the Board is composed of fewer than seven Directors or (ii) up to three persons if the size of the Board is composed\nof seven or more Directors. East’s right to designate persons for nomination for election to the Board under the Shareholder\nAgreement is the exclusive means by which East may designate or nominate persons for election to the Board. Given the Board\ncurrently consists of five Directors, East has the right to designate up to two persons for nomination for election to the Board.\nIn connection with the Annual Meeting, Messrs. Gusky and Godley were each designated for nomination for election to the\nBoard by East pursuant to the terms of the Shareholder Agreement.\nCriteria and Diversity\nIn considering whether to recommend any candidate for inclusion in the Board’s slate of recommended Director\nnominees, including candidates recommended by shareholders, the Governance and Nominating Committee will consider a\ncandidate’s background, professional experience, skill set, standard of character and integrity, being free from conflicts of\ninterest that would interfere with the proper performance of the responsibilities as a Director, ability to devote sufficient time\nto the affairs of the Corporation and the ability to act in the best interests of all shareholders. In addition, the Governance and\nNominating Committee is committed to diversity and inclusion, and believes it is important that the Board is composed of\nindividuals representing the diversity of our communities. The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee\nconceptualizes diversity to include, without limitation, concepts such as race, gender, national origin, differences of viewpoint,\neducation, skillsets and other qualities that contribute to the Board when identifying and recommending Director nominees.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee has sought and expects to continue to seek nominees with a broad diversity of\nexperiences, professions, skills, and backgrounds. The Governance and Nominating Committee does not assign specific\nweights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees, but the\nGovernance and Nominating Committee is focused on the importance that the Board consists of members that represent the\ndiversity of our communities. Rand believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the Directors, considered as a group,\nshould provide a significant composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow the Board to fulfill its\nresponsibilities.\nCode of Conduct and Business Ethics\nRand has adopted a written Code of Conduct that applies to Rand’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer that meets the requirements of Item 406 of Regulation S-K. Rand will disclose any substantive amendments to, or\nwaiver from provisions of, the Code of Conduct made with respect to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial\nOfficer on its website.\nIn addition, the Corporation has adopted a Board of Directors (Non-Interested) Business Ethics Policy Statement that\nis applicable to Rand’s Independent Directors. This Business Ethics Policy Statement acts as a general statement of the\nCorporation’s expectations regarding the ethical standards that each Independent Director should adhere to while acting on\nbehalf of the Corporation, including acting in good faith and in the honest belief that their actions are in the best interests of\nthe Corporation and its shareholders.\nFinally, a Code of Ethics has been adopted by the Corporation that is applicable to the officers and Directors of the\nCorporation that are interested persons. In addition to establishing general standards of conduct for such persons, the Code of\nEthics also includes additional procedures as provided by Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act to prevent officers and Directors of\nthe Corporation that are interested persons from abusing their access to information about the Corporation’s investments.\nThe Code of Conduct, the Business Ethics Policy Statement and the Code of Ethics are each available in the\nGovernance section of Rand’s website at www.randcapital.com. They are also available in print to any shareholder who\nrequests them.\nAudit Committee\nThe Board of Directors has determined that none of the members of the Audit Committee during 2023 were “interested\npersons” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. During 2023, the Audit Committee was comprised solely of\nIndependent Directors, each of whom met the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market and the rules of the SEC\nduring their term of service. The Board has determined that Erland E. Kailbourne is an audit committee financial expert (as\ndefined by SEC regulations). In addition to Mr. Kailbourne, the Board also believes that each of the other members of the Audit\nCommittee during 2023 possessed the requisite skills and experience to also qualify as an audit committee financial expert. In\naddition, each member that served on the Audit Committee during 2023 possessed the financial qualifications required of Audit\nCommittee members set forth in the rules and guidelines of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nProxy 14\nThe Audit Committee’s charter may be accessed at Rand’s website, www.randcapital.com.\nThe role of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities by (i) overseeing the\nCorporation’s accounting and financial reporting processes, the audit of the Corporation’s financial statements, and the\nCorporation’s internal controls over financial reporting and (ii) overseeing the preparation of and reviewing the financial reports\nand other financial information provided by the Corporation to the public.

Conflicts of interest or perceived\nconflicts of interest may also arise in determining which investment opportunities should be presented to the Corporation and\nother participating entities, funds or accounts. To mitigate these conflicts, RCM will seek to allocate such transactions on a fair\nand equitable basis and in accordance with its written allocation policies, taking into account various factors, which may\ninclude: the source of origination of the investment opportunity; investment objectives and strategies; tax considerations; risk,\ndiversification or investment concentration parameters; characteristics of the security; size of available investment; available\nliquidity and liquidity requirements; regulatory restrictions; and/or such other factors as may be relevant to a particular\ntransaction.\nCCO Agreement\nIn addition, as described above, Ms. Eastgate has been retained as the Corporation’s Chief Compliance Officer\npursuant to the terms of the CCO Agreement by and between the Corporation and OCG.
