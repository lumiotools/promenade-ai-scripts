These countermeasures lock down critical applications from adulteration while stopping code-based attacks such as malware and ransomware from executing. Further, they disrupt the techniques nation-state attackers utilize to land, expand, and then escalate privileges to take control of such systems.\n\n\"I couldn't be more thrilled about our partnership with ARIA Cybersecurity Solutions. Together, we are not just enhancing the security landscape; we are delivering unparalleled value to our OT clients. This collaboration empowers us to safeguard their operations with cutting-edge solutions, ensuring they can focus on what they do best-driving innovation and success.\"\n\nSaid Brandon Bernier CED Industrial Solutions Network Director of Market Access.\n\n\"Teaming with CED - Industrial Solutions Network represents exponential growth potential for CED, ARIA, System Integrators, and OEM machine builders nationwide.

Ensuring the highest level of protection for critical infrastructure.\n\nThe Energy Sector is one of the most targeted industries and has been hit hard by zero-day malware and ransomware which today's cybersecurity solutions struggle to stop. Since the war in Ukraine, nation-state-sponsored attacks have also focused on this sector's critical infrastructure which bypasses today's leading protection measures.\n\nThe [AZT PROTECT™](https://pr.report/4gni) solution utilizes AI-based countermeasures to stop both categories of attacks as they land on each plant's most vulnerable critical production control systems. These countermeasures lock down critical production applications from adulteration while stopping code-based attacks such as malware and ransomware from executing. Furthermore, they disrupt the techniques nation-state attackers utilize to land, expand, and then escalate privileges to take control of such systems.\n\n\"Energy providers need a better approach to providing cybersecurity. Today's approaches are too complex for most plant operators to deploy, let alone effectively staff and operate 24x7. [AZT PROTECT™](https://pr.report/4gnj) has solved this by offering a fully automated system that can be deployed quickly to provide proven round-the-clock protection\" said Gary Southwell Chief Executive of the ARIA HPP Division of CSP Inc. \"This large energy producer chose [AZT PROTECT™](https://pr.report/4gnk) because it's custom-built for their OT environments, running as effectively on legacy equipment in gas and coal-fired operations as it is in modern locked-down air-gapped nuclear power plants.

Reports Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results; Service Revenue Grows 10% Driving Continued Gross Margin Percentage; Near-record Cash Position Achieved While Continuing Infrastructure Buildout Supporting AZT PROTECT(TM) Market Penetration \n\nAugust 13, 2024\n\n_**AZT PROTECT adds Customers and Increased Reseller Partnerships to Accelerate Global Adoption**_\n\n**LOWELL, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 13, 2024 /** CSP Inc. (NASDAQ:CSPI), an award-winning provider of security and packet capture products, managed IT and professional services and technology solutions, today announced results for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2024. The company also announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share payable September 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 23, 2024.\n\n**Recent Achievements and Operating Highlights**\n\n  * 10% Services business revenue growth contributed to 150 basis point gross margin percentage improvement.\n\n  * Hired new Vice-President of Global Sales to lead ARIA sales with a focus on AZT PROTECT.\n\n  * Expanded AZT PROTECT customer base and entered new reseller partnerships to accelerate adoption among small and mid-size enterprises.\n\n  * AZT Protect won several prestigious cyber security industry awards, including winner of the \"Application Security\" category at the 2024 Fortress Cybersecurity Awards presented by Business Intelligence Group.\n\n  * Pipeline remains strong across product and service lines.\n\n  * Robust balance sheet with near record cash level allows the company to Implement near and long-term business initiatives to ensure sustained growth and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\"Our business returned to a normalized run rate during the fiscal third quarter as we continued to execute our plan to build the infrastructure required to drive future AZT PROTECT sales,\" commented Victor Dellovo, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our Technology Solutions (TS) business added new MSP customers and successfully expanded relationships with existing customers. Moreover, we are currently awaiting customer decisions on several orders that could favorably impact our results in fiscal 2025. We also continued to generate higher levels of interest in our UCaaS offering, and during the current fiscal fourth quarter we have already signed several new customers. As a result of this UCaaS business development, we expect to enter the new fiscal year with an annual revenue run rate that is more than double what it was entering fiscal 2024.\"\n\n\"The AZT Protect offering, which is part of our High-Performance Products (HPP) business, continues to be a key focus for our team. During the fiscal third quarter, we added a mid-tier manufacturing client, increased the pipeline, and received several brand-enhancing industry awards. We also continued to build the organizational infrastructure required to realize AZT PROTECT's full potential by hiring Greg Pysher, an experienced, 20-year IT industry sales veteran as Vice President of Global Sales of ARIA. Greg is transforming our sales team and in just a few weeks, his impact is being felt throughout the organization and I look forward to his many contributions. While the target market for AZT Protect was initially focused on the operational technology (OT) market, we had recently decided to engage the information technology (IT) market. The timing of the recent CrowdStrike-induced Windows outage is a development that we believe would have been controlled at the corporate level if AZT PROTECT had been previously deployed by the effected organization.\"\n\n\"The strength of the TS business is enabling our self-funding of AZT PROTECT's development and market entry. We believe AZT Protect has the potential to revolutionize how OT and IT professionals approach their responsibilities and ensure their businesses are not compromised, whether from external threats and/or third-party software updates. And, by remaining steadfast in our commitment to develop innovative and higher margin products and services, we have expanded our gross margin percentage and improved our cash balance to near record level - giving us tremendous flexibility to achieve our multi-year revenue and profitability targets.\"\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2024, was $13.1 million compared to revenue of $17.7 million for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023. In the year-ago fiscal third quarter, the Company converted a sizeable portion of its backlog to revenue as supply chain issues had eased and the Company was able to get key components to complete and ship customer orders. Sequentially, the revenue was relatively flat compared to the 2024 fiscal second quarter as the business returned to a more normalized run rate.\n\nServices revenue constituted $5.3 million of overall sales; a 10% increase compared to the year-ago services revenue of $4.8 million. Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $4.6 million, or 35.0% of sales, compared to $5.9 million, or 33.5% of sales, representing a 150-basis point improvement as higher margin services revenue fueled the improvement. The Company reported a net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $2.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company generated $2.4 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and as of June 30, 2024, had cash and cash equivalents of $28.9 million ensuring it has the resources to implement the AZT PROTECT product offering growth strategy. During the fiscal third quarter 2024, the Company repurchased 4,800 shares for a total cost of $70,000.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Nine Month Results**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal nine months ended June 30, 2024, was $42.2 million compared with revenue of $49.3 million in the same prior year period. Gross profit for the fiscal nine months ended March 31, 2023, was $15.2 million, or 35.9% of sales compared with $16.7 million, or 33.9% of sales, reflecting a more favorable product mix and benefiting from the higher year-to-date services revenue. The Company reported net income of $1.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share in the fiscal nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared with net income of $3.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share for the fiscal nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nCSPi Chief Executive Officer Victor Dellovo and Chief Financial Officer Gary W.

Reports Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Operating Results; Service Revenue Grows 10% Driving Continued Gross Margin Percentage; Near-record Cash Position Achieved While Continuing Infrastructure Buildout Supporting AZT PROTECT(TM) Market Penetration \n\nAugust 13, 2024\n\n_**AZT PROTECT adds Customers and Increased Reseller Partnerships to Accelerate Global Adoption**_\n\n**LOWELL, MA / ACCESSWIRE / August 13, 2024 /** CSP Inc. (NASDAQ:CSPI), an award-winning provider of security and packet capture products, managed IT and professional services and technology solutions, today announced results for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2024. The company also announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share payable September 10, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 23, 2024.\n\n**Recent Achievements and Operating Highlights**\n\n  * 10% Services business revenue growth contributed to 150 basis point gross margin percentage improvement.\n\n  * Hired new Vice-President of Global Sales to lead ARIA sales with a focus on AZT PROTECT.\n\n  * Expanded AZT PROTECT customer base and entered new reseller partnerships to accelerate adoption among small and mid-size enterprises.\n\n  * AZT Protect won several prestigious cyber security industry awards, including winner of the \"Application Security\" category at the 2024 Fortress Cybersecurity Awards presented by Business Intelligence Group.\n\n  * Pipeline remains strong across product and service lines.\n\n  * Robust balance sheet with near record cash level allows the company to Implement near and long-term business initiatives to ensure sustained growth and profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\"Our business returned to a normalized run rate during the fiscal third quarter as we continued to execute our plan to build the infrastructure required to drive future AZT PROTECT sales,\" commented Victor Dellovo, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our Technology Solutions (TS) business added new MSP customers and successfully expanded relationships with existing customers. Moreover, we are currently awaiting customer decisions on several orders that could favorably impact our results in fiscal 2025. We also continued to generate higher levels of interest in our UCaaS offering, and during the current fiscal fourth quarter we have already signed several new customers. As a result of this UCaaS business development, we expect to enter the new fiscal year with an annual revenue run rate that is more than double what it was entering fiscal 2024.\"\n\n\"The AZT Protect offering, which is part of our High-Performance Products (HPP) business, continues to be a key focus for our team. During the fiscal third quarter, we added a mid-tier manufacturing client, increased the pipeline, and received several brand-enhancing industry awards. We also continued to build the organizational infrastructure required to realize AZT PROTECT's full potential by hiring Greg Pysher, an experienced, 20-year IT industry sales veteran as Vice President of Global Sales of ARIA. Greg is transforming our sales team and in just a few weeks, his impact is being felt throughout the organization and I look forward to his many contributions. While the target market for AZT Protect was initially focused on the operational technology (OT) market, we had recently decided to engage the information technology (IT) market. The timing of the recent CrowdStrike-induced Windows outage is a development that we believe would have been controlled at the corporate level if AZT PROTECT had been previously deployed by the effected organization.\"\n\n\"The strength of the TS business is enabling our self-funding of AZT PROTECT's development and market entry. We believe AZT Protect has the potential to revolutionize how OT and IT professionals approach their responsibilities and ensure their businesses are not compromised, whether from external threats and/or third-party software updates. And, by remaining steadfast in our commitment to develop innovative and higher margin products and services, we have expanded our gross margin percentage and improved our cash balance to near record level - giving us tremendous flexibility to achieve our multi-year revenue and profitability targets.\"\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2024, was $13.1 million compared to revenue of $17.7 million for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023. In the year-ago fiscal third quarter, the Company converted a sizeable portion of its backlog to revenue as supply chain issues had eased and the Company was able to get key components to complete and ship customer orders. Sequentially, the revenue was relatively flat compared to the 2024 fiscal second quarter as the business returned to a more normalized run rate.\n\nServices revenue constituted $5.3 million of overall sales; a 10% increase compared to the year-ago services revenue of $4.8 million. Gross profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $4.6 million, or 35.0% of sales, compared to $5.9 million, or 33.5% of sales, representing a 150-basis point improvement as higher margin services revenue fueled the improvement. The Company reported a net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $2.5 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share for the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company generated $2.4 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and as of June 30, 2024, had cash and cash equivalents of $28.9 million ensuring it has the resources to implement the AZT PROTECT product offering growth strategy. During the fiscal third quarter 2024, the Company repurchased 4,800 shares for a total cost of $70,000.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Nine Month Results**\n\nRevenue for the fiscal nine months ended June 30, 2024, was $42.2 million compared with revenue of $49.3 million in the same prior year period. Gross profit for the fiscal nine months ended March 31, 2023, was $15.2 million, or 35.9% of sales compared with $16.7 million, or 33.9% of sales, reflecting a more favorable product mix and benefiting from the higher year-to-date services revenue. The Company reported net income of $1.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted common share in the fiscal nine months ended June 30, 2024, compared with net income of $3.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share for the fiscal nine months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nCSPi Chief Executive Officer Victor Dellovo and Chief Financial Officer Gary W. Levine will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. (ET) today to review CSPi's financial results and provide a business update.

The amended guidance replaces the current incurred loss impairment\nmethodology for measurement of credit losses on financial instruments with a methodology (the “current expected credit\nlosses model,” or “CECL model”) that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of\nreasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Under the CECL model, the allowance for losses on\nfinancial assets, measured at amortized cost, reflects management’s estimate of credit losses over the remaining expected life\nof such assets.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 (the “new CECL standard”) as of October 1, 2023 using the modified\nretrospective method, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of Shareholders’ equity as of October 1,\n2023. The adoption primarily impacted the estimation of our Allowance for credit losses for Accounts receivable and\nFinancing receivables. Additionally, it affected allowance for credit losses of contract assets with effects being immaterial. The\ntotal impact recorded on our initial adoption of ASU 2016-13 as of October 1, 2023 included an increase of Accounts\nreceivable, net of $67k and a decrease of Financing receivables, net in the amount of $82k with the total adjustment\ndecreasing retained earnings of $15k.

Post contract\nmaintenance and support is considered immaterial in the context of the contract and therefore is not a separate performance\nobligation. Multicomputer revenue is derived from the sale of hardware, software, extended warranties, royalties, and repair\nservices. ARIA Zero Trust Gateway (“AZT”) revenue contains two performance obligations: a software license and post\ncontract support. The transaction price is generally fixed consideration and allocated based on relative stand-alone selling\nprice.

As a practical expedient, we have\nelected not to adjust the amount of consideration for effects of a significant financing component when it is anticipated the\npromised good or service will be transferred and the subsequent payment will be one year or less.\nCertain contracts contain a financing component including managed services contracts with financing of hardware\nand software. The interest rate used reflects the approximate interest rate consistent with a separate financing transaction with\nthe customer at the inception of the agreement.

Due to the complex nature of these contracts, there is significant judgment in allocating the transaction price.\nThese estimates are periodically reviewed by project managers, engineers, and other staff involved to ensure estimates remain\nappropriate. For items sold separately, including hardware, software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other\nservices, and third-party service contracts, there is no allocation as there is one performance obligation.\nWe recognize revenue from third-party service contracts as either gross sales or net sales depending on whether we\nare acting as a principal party to the transaction or simply acting as an agent or broker based on control and timing. We are a\nprincipal if we control the good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer. We record revenue as\ngross when we are a principal party to the arrangement and net of cost when we are acting as a broker or agent for a third\nparty. Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded in revenue and our cost to the third-party service\nprovider or vendor is recorded in cost of sales. Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or\nvendor is recorded as a reduction to revenue resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction. Third-party\nservice contracts are sold in different combinations with hardware, software, and services. When we are an agent, revenue is\ntypically recorded at a point in time. When we are the principal, revenue is recognized over the contract term. We have\nconcluded we are the agent in sales of third-party maintenance, software or hardware support, and certain security software\nthat is sold with integral third-party delivered software maintenance that includes critical updates.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nWhen we have performed work but do not have an unconditional right to payment, a contract asset is recorded.

Determining whether to offer financing involves looking at the customer’s\npayment history, economic conditions, and capacity to pay.\nThe Company assigns an internal risk rating to each customer at inception, which groups customers into a portfolio\nbased off this risk rating. A risk rating is assigned by analyzing a customer’s financial statements and the latest Fitch rating if\npublicly available as well as recent payment activity. The credit quality of customers is continually monitored by these items.\nAccounts rated low risk have the equivalent of a Fitch rating of BBB– or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk have the\nequivalent of BB. The Company does not offer financing for customers where the risk is classified as higher, which would be\nlower than the equivalent of a BB Fitch rating.\nFinancing receivables, net carry an average weighted average interest rate of 7.1%, which reflects the approximate\ninterest rate consistent with a separate financing transaction with the customer at the inception of the agreement.\nThe amount of interest income earned from sales whose payment terms exceed one year for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2024 and 2023 was $177 thousand and $234 thousand, respectively.

A probability method for calculating credit losses is used based on historical data of defaults\nof Fitch ratings and length of time. Various factors are also assessed in the allowance for credit losses including internal\nhistorical data as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions and management judgments applicable to and through the\nexpected life of the portfolios. Macroeconomic conditions include the level of gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth and\nunemployment rates, which directly correlate with our historical credit losses. The expense associated with the\n18\nTable of Contents\nallowance for expected credit losses is recognized in Selling, general, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated\nStatements of Operations.\nFinancing receivables whose payment terms exceed one year are placed on non-accrual status, meaning interest\nincome stops being recorded, when the customer has a past due amount in excess of 30 days or reasonable doubt exists in\ncollecting all interest and principal. A payment due in excess of 30 days is considered delinquent. If a payment is received for\na receivable on non-accrual status the payment is first applied to interest and then principal.

In the TS segment, we seek to minimize obsolete inventory by having nearly all of our inventory purchased in\nconjunction with a sales agreement. From time to time, we do purchase certain inventory in bulk to receive discounts, but only\nwhen we anticipate selling this inventory.

Forward-looking statements include statements in which we\nuse words such as “expect”, “believe”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “project”, “estimate”, “should”, “could”, “may”, “plan”,\n“potential”, “predict”, “project”, “will”, “would” and similar expressions. Although we believe the expectations reflected in\nsuch forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, the forward-looking statements are subject to\nsignificant risks and uncertainties, and thus we cannot assure you that these expectations will prove to have been correct, and\nactual results may vary from those contained in such forward-looking statements. We discuss many of these risks and\nuncertainties in Item 1A under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. Factors that may cause such variances include, but are not limited to, our dependence on a small number\nof customers for a significant portion of our revenue, our high dependence on contracts with the US federal government, our\nreliance in certain circumstances on single sources for supply of key product components, intense competition in the market\nsegments in which we operate, changes in the US Tax laws, inflationary pressures, and the impact of the Ukraine-Russian\nmilitary and Israeli-Hamas conflict on global trade and financial markets. Given these uncertainties, you should not place\nundue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, forward-looking statements represent our estimates and\nassumptions only as of the date of this document. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this report, whether as a result of new information, future events\nor otherwise. This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing and in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those\nrelated to the allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable and financing receivables, inventory valuation, impairment\nassessment of intangibles, income taxes, deferred compensation and retirement plans, as well as estimated selling prices used\nfor revenue recognition and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical performance and on various other assumptions\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the\ncarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates under different assumptions or conditions. A description of our critical accounting policies is contained in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 in the “Critical Accounting Policies” section\ncontained in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\n28\nTable of Contents\nCondition and Results of Operations.

In consolidation, US\ndollars and Euros are remeasured into the functional currency, British Pounds, of our UK subsidiary. This non-cash\nremeasurement is included in the foreign exchange gain (loss) on the income statement. The foreign exchange loss was\nprimarily from the US Dollar bank account in our TS UK division.\nInterest income increased $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year\nperiod primarily due to increased interest rates from the same prior year period, which has resulted in increased interest\nincome from money market accounts in both the US and UK. There was a decrease in interest income from agreements that\nhave payment terms in excess of one year (see (cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)W in Item 1 to this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q for details). Although new agreements with higher interest rates have been entered into during fiscal year 2023 and 2024,\nthis is more than offset by lower interest income recognized from prior agreements as interest income decreases as time\nelapses due to principal payments being received. All of these agreements are in the TS-US division.\nThe interest expense decrease of $27 thousand for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same prior\nyear period was related to the TS US division making principal payments on multi-year vendor contracts that started in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2021 related to sales agreements that have payment terms in excess of one year as the\n32\nTable of Contents\nCompany incurs less interest expense over time as principal payments are made.

Additionally, there was no interest expense incurred in the\ncurrent period for a note payable compared to the prior year as the note was paid in full the first day of fiscal year 2024. These\ndecreases were partially offset by an increase of interest expense from several subsequent multi-year vendor agreements\nentered into in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024.\n(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)D (cid:0)[ (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nAn income tax benefit of $75 thousand was recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to an\nincome tax benefit of $1.7 million in the same period of 2023.

The difference between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate for the three months\nending June 30, 2024 are the impact of state taxes and tax credits that we expect to be able to utilize against federal and state\ntaxes. During the 3 months ending June 30, 2023, we released a significant portion of the valuation allowance against our U.S.\ndeferred tax assets and switched from using the discrete effective tax rate method to calculate income taxes to the annualized\neffective tax rate method, resulting in the shift in the effective tax rate during the period.\nThe effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was (29.3)%, excluding the UK as previously\nmentioned, driven by excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards vesting during the period. The effective tax rate for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2023 was (201.9)%, excluding the UK, which was primarily driven by the release of a significant\nportion of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nWhile the Company had maintained a full valuation allowance, we had been using the discrete effective tax rate\nmethod to calculate income taxes for the purposes of quarterly reporting. Now that the valuation allowance has been reduced,\nthe Company has resumed using the annualized effective tax rate method to calculate income taxes as prescribed under ASC\n740 and has done so for the three months ending June 30, 2024.\n(cid:0)2 (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)Z (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)P (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)K (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)H (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)- (cid:0)X (cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:23)\nOur sales decreased by $7.1 million, or 14%, to $42.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 as compared\nto $49.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2023.

In consolidation, US dollars\nand Euros are remeasured into the functional currency, British Pounds, of our UK subsidiary. This non-cash remeasurement is\nincluded in the foreign exchange loss on the income statement. The foreign exchange loss was primarily from the US Dollar\nbank account in our TS UK division.\nInterest income increased $0.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same prior year\nperiod primarily due to increased interest rates from the same prior year period, which has resulted in increased interest\nincome from money market accounts in both the US and UK. There was a slight decrease in interest income from agreements\nthat have payment terms in excess of one year (see (cid:0)1 (cid:0)R (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:24) (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)U (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:15)(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)Q (cid:0)H (cid:0)W in Item 1 to this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for details). Although new agreements that have payment terms in excess of one year with higher interest rates\nhave been entered into during fiscal year 2023 and 2024, this is more than offset by lower interest income recognized from\nprior agreements as interest income decreases as time elapses due to principal payments being received. All of these\nagreements are in the TS-US division.\nThe interest expense decrease of $58 thousand for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same prior\nyear period was related to the TS US division making principal payments on multi-year vendor contracts that started in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2021 related to sales agreements that have payment terms in excess of one year as the Company\nincurs less interest expense over time as principal payments are made. Additionally, there was no interest expense incurred in\nthe current period for the note payable compared to the prior year as the note was paid in full the first day of fiscal year 2024.\nThese decreases were partially offset by an increase from several subsequent multi-year vendor agreement in the third quarter\nof fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024.

The estimated annualized effective income tax rate for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2024 was 19.2%, excluding the impacts of the UK entity which continues to experience losses and\nmaintains a full valuation allowance, compared to the estimated annualized effective income tax rate of 22.0% for the nine\nmonths ended June 30, 2023. The difference between our effective income tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate for the\nthree months ending June 30, 2024 and the same period of 2023 are the impact of state taxes and tax credits that we expect to\nbe able to utilize against federal and state taxes.\nThe effective tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 was 4.9%, excluding the UK as previously mentioned,\ndriven by excess tax benefits on restricted stock awards vesting during the period. The effective tax rate for\n37\nTable of Contents\nthe nine months ended June 30, 2023 was (51.4)%, excluding the UK, which was primarily driven by the release of a\nsignificant portion of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the U.S.\nWhile the Company had maintained a full valuation allowance, we had been using the discrete effective tax rate\nmethod to calculate income taxes for the purposes of quarterly reporting. Now that the valuation allowance has been reduced,\nthe Company has resumed using the annualized effective tax rate method to calculate income taxes as prescribed under ASC\n740 and has done so for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024.\n(cid:0)/ (cid:0)L(cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)G (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)F (cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nOur primary source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents and our line of credit.\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $3.7 million to $28.9 million as of June 30, 2024 from $25.2 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023:\nNine months ended\n(Dollar amounts in thousands) 2024 2023\n(Dollar amounts in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 5,721 $ (4,948)\nInvesting activities (238) (2,681)\nFinancing activities (1,824) (2,600)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash 15 95\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,674 $ (10,134)\n(cid:0)2 (cid:0)S (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)D (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nCash provided by operating activities was $5.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $4.9\nmillion used in operating activities in the prior year. The increase from the prior year is primarily related to an increase in\naccounts payable and accrued expenses of $9.1 million, decreased accounts receivable of $4.8 million and decreased other\nlong-term liabilities of $1.7 million. These items were partially offset by decreased net income of $2.5 million, decreased\nother assets of $2.3 million, increased financing receivables of $0.8 million, and increased inventory of $0.1 million.\nInventory fluctuations are dependent on when orders are received and shipped.

Our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management team\nsupervised and participated in this evaluation. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-\n15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure\ncontrols and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the\ncompany’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily\napplies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of\nour disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)K (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0), (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)& (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)F (cid:0)L(cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)S (cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting\nthat have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n39\nTable of Contents\nPART II.
