With each distribution, the Fund will issue a notice to its stockholders and an accompanying press release\nthat provides detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution (including whether any portion\nof the distribution represents a return of capital) and other information required by the Fund’s MDP . You should not draw\nany conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of distributions or from the terms of the Fund’s\nMDP .

ORGANIZATION\nSprott Focus Trust, Inc. (the “Fund”) is a diversified closed-end investment company incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Fund\ncommenced operations on March 2, 1988, and Sprott Asset Management LP and Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc. assumed investment management\nresponsibility for the Fund after the close of business on March 6, 2015. Royce & Associates, LLC was the Fund’s previous investment manager. After\nMarch 6, 2015, Sprott Asset Management LP was the investment adviser, and Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc. was the sub-adviser of the Fund. On\nJuly 1, 2023, Sprott Asset Management LP became the sponsor of the Fund and no longer serves as investment adviser, and Sprott Asset Management USA,\nInc. (the “Adviser”) commenced acting as investment adviser to the Fund and continues to serve as such.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund. These policies are in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAt June 30, 2024, officers, employees of Sprott Inc. and its subsidiaries, Fund directors, and other affiliates owned approximately 51% of the Fund.\nA. Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nB. Portfolio Valuation and Methodologies\nSecurities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on the valuation date. All\nexchange traded securities are valued using the last trade or closing sale price from the primary publicly recognized exchange. If no current closing sale\nprice is available, the mean of the closing bid and ask price is used. If no current day price quotation is available, the previous business day’s closing sale\nprice is used. Investments in open-end mutual funds such as money market funds are valued at the closing NAV. Repurchase agreements are valued at\ncontract amount plus accrued interest, which approximates market value. The Fund values its non-U.S. dollar denominated securities in U.S. dollars daily\nat the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates as quoted by a major bank. If events (e.g., market volatility, company announcement or a natural disaster)\noccur that are expected to materially affect the value of the Fund’s investment, or in the event that it is determined that valuation results in a price for an\ninvestment that is deemed not to be representative of the market value of such investment, or if a price is not available, the investment will be valued in\naccordance with the Adviser’s policies and procedures as reflecting fair value (“Fair Value Policies and Procedures”). U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the\nprice a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The\nBoard of Directors of the Fund (the “Board”) has approved the designation of the Adviser of the Fund as the valuation designee for the Fund. If a security’s\nmarket price is not readily available or does not otherwise accurately represent the fair value of the security, the security will be valued in accordance with\nthe Fair Value Policies and Procedures as reflecting fair value. The Adviser has formed a committee (the “Valuation Committee”) to develop pricing policies\nand procedures and to oversee the pricing function for all financial instruments.\nC. Fair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair valuation approaches that may be used by the Valuation Committee include market approach, income approach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use of market comparables and matrix pricing are types of valuation approaches and are typically used in\ndetermining fair value. When determining the price for fair valued investments, the Valuation Committee seeks to determine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the current sale or purchase of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Fair value determinations shall\nbe based upon all available factors that the Valuation Committee deems relevant and consistent with the principles of fair value measurement.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the value of the Fund’s investments, as noted above. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels below:\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.\nLevel 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, foreign securities that may be fair valued and repurchase agreements).\nLevel 3 – significant unobservable inputs.\nThe inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.\n15 | June 30, 2024\nSprott Focus Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) June 30, 2024\nThe following is a summary of the Fund’s investments as of June 30, 2024 based on the inputs used to value them. For a detailed breakout of common\nstocks by sector classification, please refer to the Schedule of Investments.\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCommon Stocks $ 242,481,284 $ — $ — $ 242,481,284\nRepurchase Agreements — 13,573,644 — 13,573,644\nSecurities Lending Collateral 20,964 — — 20,964\nTotal $ 242,502,248 $ 13,573,644 $ — $ 256,075,892\nThere were no transfers between levels for investments held at the end of the period.\nD. Investment Transactions and Related Investment Income\nInvestment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividend income is recorded\nat the fair market value of the securities received. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Premium and discounts on debt securities are amortized\nusing the effective yield-to-maturity method. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are determined on the basis of identified cost for\nbook and tax purposes.\nIncome received from foreign sources may result in withholding tax. Withholding taxes are accrued at the same time as the related income if the tax rate\nis fixed and known, unless a tax withheld is reclaimable from the local tax authorities in which case it is recorded as receivable. If the tax rate is not known\nor estimable, such expense or reclaim receivable is recorded when the net proceeds are received.\nE. Expenses\nThe Fund incurs direct and indirect expenses. Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund’s operations, while expenses applicable\nto more than one fund managed by the Adviser are allocated equitably.\nF. Compensating Balance Credits\nThe Fund has an arrangement with its custodian bank, whereby a portion of the custodian’s fee is paid indirectly by credits earned on the Fund’s cash on\ndeposit with the bank. This deposit arrangement is an alternative to purchasing overnight investments. Conversely, the Fund pays interest to the custodian\non any cash overdrafts, to the extent they are not offset by credits earned (interest accrued) on positive cash balances. The amount of credits earned on\nthe Fund’s cash on deposit amounted to $675 for the six months ended June 30, 2024.\n3. RISKS\nA. Common Stock\nThe Fund invests a significant amount of assets in common stock. The value of common stock held by the Fund will fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and\nunpredictably, due to general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of common stock held by the Fund\nparticipate or factors relating to specific companies in which the Fund invests.\nB. Repurchase Agreements\nThe Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with institutions that the Adviser has determined are creditworthy. The Fund restricts repurchase\nagreements to maturities of no more than seven days. Securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements, which are held until maturity of the\nrepurchase agreements, are marked-to-market daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the principal amount of the repurchase agreement (including\naccrued interest). Repurchase agreements could involve certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the counter-party, including possible delays\nor restrictions upon the ability of the Fund to dispose of its underlying securities. The maturity associated with these securities is considered continuous.\nC. Foreign Currency\nThe Fund does not isolate the portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations\narising from changes in market prices of securities held. Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales and maturities of short-term\nsecurities, sales of foreign currencies, expiration of currency forward contracts, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates\non securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Fund’s books\nand the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the value\nof assets and liabilities, including investments in securities at the end of the reporting period, as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nD. Metals and Mining Industry Risk\nCompanies in the metals and mining industry are susceptible to fluctuations in worldwide metal prices and extraction and production costs. In addition,\nmetals and mining companies may have significant operations in areas at risk for social and political unrest, security concerns and environmental damage.\nThese companies may also be at risk for increased government regulation and intervention. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which the\nFund has exposure.\n16 | June 30, 2024\nSprott Focus Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) June 30, 2024\n4. TAXES\nAs a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent that\nit distributes substantially all of its taxable income for its fiscal year.\n5. DISTRIBUTIONS\nThe Fund pays quarterly distributions on the Fund’s Common Stock at the annual rate of 6% of the rolling average of the prior four calendar quarter-\nend NAVs of the Fund’s Common Stock, with the fourth quarter distribution being the greater of 1.5% of the rolling average or the distribution required\nby IRS regulations. Distributions are recorded on ex-dividend date and to the extent that distributions are not paid from long-term capital gains, net\ninvestment income or net short-term capital gains, they will represent a return of capital. Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax\nregulations that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Permanent book and tax differences relating\nto stockholder distributions will result in reclassifications within the capital accounts. Undistributed net investment income may include temporary book\nand tax basis differences, which will reverse in a subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining undistributed at fiscal year-end is distributed\nin the following year.\n6. CAPITAL STOCK\nThe Fund issued 632,090 and 1,118,253 shares of Common Stock as reinvestments of distributions for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\nOn June 7, 2024, the Board authorized the Fund to repurchase 5% of shares of the Fund until June 30, 2025. Any such repurchase would take place at the\nprevailing prices in the open market or in other transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the Fund’s share repurchases under its share repurchase program for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024 and year\nended December 31, 2023, respectively:\nFor six-month period For year ended\nended June 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nDollar amount repurchased $4,713,950 $9,739,029\nShares repurchased 606,870 1,211,710\nAverage price per share (including commission) 7.79 7.97\nWeighted average discount to NAV 10.61% 6.67%\n7. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and the Fund provides for fees to be paid at an annual rate of 1.0% of the Fund’s average daily\nnet assets. The Fund accrued investment advisory fees totaling $1,286,186 to the Adviser for the six-month period ended June 30, 2024.\n8. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the costs of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, other than short-term securities,\namounted to $20,009,009 and $30,206,816, respectively.\n9. LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\nThe Fund, using State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) as its lending agent, may loan securities to qualified brokers and dealers in exchange\nfor negotiated lenders’ fees. The Fund receives cash collateral, which may be invested by the lending agent in short-term instruments. Collateral for\nsecurities on loan is at least equal to 102% (for loans of U.S. securities) or 105% (for loans of non-U.S. securities) of the market value of the loaned securities\nat the inception of each loan. The market value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any additional required\ncollateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business day. As of June 30, 2024, the cash collateral received by the Fund was invested in the State Street\nNavigator Securities Lending Government Money Market Portfolio, which is a 1940 Act registered money market fund. To the extent that advisory or other\nfees paid by the State Street Navigator Securities Lending Government Money Market Portfolio are for the same or similar services as fees paid by the Fund,\nthere will be a layering of fees, which would increase expenses and decrease returns. Information regarding the value of the securities loaned and the value\n17 | June 30, 2024\nSprott Focus Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) June 30, 2024\nof the collateral at period end is included in the Schedule of Investments. The Fund could experience a delay in recovering its securities, a possible loss of\nincome or value and record realized gain or loss on securities deemed sold due to a borrower’s inability to return securities on loan. These loans involve\nthe risk of delay in receiving additional collateral in the event that the collateral decreases below the value of the securities loaned and the risks of the loss\nof rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities experience financial difficulties.\nPursuant to the current securities lending agreement, the Fund retains 80% of securities lending income (which excludes collateral investment expenses).\nSecurities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and excludes collateral investment\nfees), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. State Street bears all operational costs directly related to securities lending.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Fund had outstanding loans of securities to certain approved brokers for which the Fund received collateral:\nMarket Value of Market Value of Market Value of Total\nLoaned Securities Cash Collateral Non Cash Collateral Collateral\n$1,285,309 $20,964 $1,297,755 $1,318,719\nThe following table presents financial instruments, net of the related collateral received by the Portfolio as of June 30, 2024.\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities\nGross Asset Amounts Presented in Financial Collateral Net Amount\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities(a) Instrument Received(b) (not less than $0)\n$1,285,309 $— $(1,285,309) $—\n(a) Represents market value of loaned securities at year end.\n(b) The actual collateral received is greater than the amount shown here due to collateral requirements of the security lending agreement.\nAll securities on loan are classified as Common Stock in the Fund’s Schedule of Investments as of June 30, 2024, with a contractual maturity of\novernight and continuous.\nOther information regarding the Fund is available in the Fund’s most recent Report to Stockholders.

A return of capital may\noccur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in\nthe Fund is paid back to you. Any such returns of capital will decrease the\nFund’s total assets and, therefore, could have the effect of increasing the\nFund’s expense ratio. In addition, in order to make the level of distributions\ncalled for under the MDP, the Fund may have to sell portfolio securities\nat a less than opportune time. A return of capital does not necessarily\nreflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused\nwith ‘yield’ or ‘income’. The Fund’s total return in relation to changes in net\nasset value is presented in the Financial Highlights.\nThe 19(a) Notices containing the Fund’s most current distribution\ninformation as of June 30, 2024 (as required by a certain exempted\nregulatory relief the Fund has received) are set forth in the Appendix\nto this Report.\nShareholders may participate in the Fund’s Dividend Reinvestment\nPlan. Distributions reinvested in additional shares of the Fund will\nnevertheless be taxable to Beneficial Owners acquiring such additional\nshares to the same extent as if such distributions had been received in\ncash. A shareholder may terminate his or her participation in the Fund’s\ndistribution reinvestment plan by contacting his or her broker.\n21 | June 30, 2024\nSprott Focus Trust\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment Advisory and Agreement (Unaudited)\nBoard Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement for Sprott Focus Trust, Inc.\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Sprott Focus Trust, Inc. (the “Fund”) met in person at a regularly scheduled meeting on June 7, 2024, in Watch\nHill, Rhode Island, for purposes of, among other things, considering whether it would be in the best interest of the Fund and its stockholders for the\nBoard to approve the renewal of the Amended Investment Advisory Agreement (the “Advisory Agreement”) by and between the Fund and Sprott Asset\nManagement USA, Inc. (the “Adviser”).\nIn connection with the Board’s review of the Agreement, the directors who were not “interested persons” of the Fund within the meaning of the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) (collectively, the “Independent Directors”) requested, and the Adviser provided the Board with,\ninformation about a variety of matters, including, without limitation, the following information:\n• nature, extent and quality of services to be provided by the Adviser, including background information on the qualifications and experience of\nkey professional of the Adviser personnel that provide services to the Fund;\n• investment performance of the Fund, including comparative performance information for registered investment companies similar to the Fund;\n• fees charged to and expenses of the Fund, including comparative fee and expense information for registered investment companies similar to\nthe Fund;\n• costs of the services provided, and profits realized by the Adviser; and\n• economies of scale.\nIn connection with the Board’s review of the Agreement, the Independent Directors considered the matters set forth above along with the\nfollowing information:\n• Whitney George’s long portfolio management tenure with the Fund and its historical investment performance;\n• Mr. George’s significant ownership and, thus, stake in the Fund; and\n• the Adviser’s experience in managing registered investment companies, private investment vehicles and separately managed accounts.\nAt the June 7, 2024 meeting, the Board and the Independent Directors determined that the continuation of the Agreement was in the best interests of the\nFund in light of the services, personnel, expenses and such other matters as the Board considered to be relevant in the exercise of its reasonable business\njudgment and approved them.\nTo reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the 1940 Act as well as under the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving\nadvisory contract; the fiduciary duty of investment adviser with respect to advisory agreement and the receipt of investment advisory compensation; the\nstandards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in\nvoting on such agreement. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreement, the Independent Directors received materials in advance of the Board\nmeeting from the Adviser. The Independent Directors also met with Mr. George. The Board applied its business judgment to determine whether the\narrangement by and between the Fund and the Adviser are reasonable business arrangements from the Fund’s perspective as well as from the perspective\nof its stockholders.\nNature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc.\nThe Board reviewed materials provided by the Adviser related to the proposed approval of the Advisory Agreement. The Board noted that the Adviser\nmanages approximate $4.6 billion in assets of December 31, 2023 and provides investment management services on a discretionary basis to its clients,\nwhich include individuals and institutional with separately managed accounts.\nThe Board further noted that the Adviser and the predecessor investment adviser of the Fund were each wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sprott, Inc. and\nboth entities shared personnel and resources as they were part of the same organization. The Board reviewed the credentials of the key investment\npersonnel. that continue to be responsible for servicing the Fund, noting that each has considerable experience in the asset management industry. The\nBoard reviewed the credentials of the key investment personnel that are responsible for servicing the Fund, noting Mr. George’s long tenure as the Fund’s\nportfolio manager. The Board also considered the significant experience and background of senior management of the Adviser. The Board discussed\nthe services that are provided to the Fund, which include portfolio management, research, compliance and analysis. Additionally, the Board received\nsatisfactory responses from the representatives of the Adviser with respect to whether the Adviser was involved in any lawsuits or pending regulatory\n22 | June 30, 2024\nSprott Focus Trust\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment Advisory and Agreement (Unaudited)\nactions. The Board reviewed the best-execution practices of the Adviser and discussed the various factors considered by the Adviser when selecting\nbrokers. The Board concluded that based on the responses in this questionnaire and questions at the meeting, and their experience with the Adviser, they\ncould expect the Adviser to continue to provide high quality service to the Fund and its shareholders.\nInvestment Performance\nThe Board observed that the Fund outperformed the peer group, for the 3-year, 5-year and since inception while underperforming in the 1-year time\nperiod. The Board further noted that the Fund outperformed its benchmark index for the 3-year and since inception periods while underperforming in\nthe 1-year and 5-year time periods. The Board considered the Adviser’s explanations noting the performance differential over longer period is likely to be\nfrom the Fund’s disciplined valuation framework driving portfolio activity and the longstanding underperformance of similarly disciplined value strategies\nvs. growth-oriented strategies. After further discussion, the Board concluded that the Adviser had the potential to continue to provide reasonable returns\nfor the Fund.\nFees and Expenses\nThe Board noted that the Fund’s advisory fee of 1.00% was slightly below the peer group and Morningstar category medians. The Board reviewed the Fund’s\nnet expense ratio of 1.15% and acknowledged it was below the peer group and Morningstar category averages and medians. After further discussion, the\nBoard concluded that the advisory fee for the Fund was not unreasonable.\nProfitability\nThe Board reviewed the profitability analysis provided by the Adviser and noted that the Adviser realized a profit in managing the Fund. The Board\nacknowledged the effort required to maintain and manage the Fund’s complex investment program and determined the Adviser’s profitability was\nnot excessive.\nEconomies of Scale\nThe Board considered the existence of any economies of scale in the provision of services by the Adviser and whether those economies were shared with\nthe Fund through breakpoints in its management fees or other means, such as expense caps or fee waivers. The Board noted that the assets of the Fund\nwere too small to meaningfully consider economies of scale and the necessity of breakpoints. The Board concluded that the current fee structure for the\nFund was reasonable and that no changes were currently necessary.\nConclusion\nHaving requested and received such information from the adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Advisory\nAgreement, the Board concluded that renewal of the Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.\n23 | June 30, 2024\nSprott Focus Trust\nSPROTT FOCUS TRUST, INC.\nSprott Asset Management USA\nSuite 230, 320 Post Road\nDarien, Connecticut\nUSA 06820\nTel: (855) 943-8099\nAPPENDIX\nTel: (203) 636-0977\n2024 19(a) Notices\nNotification of Sources of Distributions\nPursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940\nThe 19(a) Notices set forth in this Appendix may be found\nQuarterly Distribution for Sprott Focus Trust, Inc.\nat https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/focus-trust.\nSprott Focus Trust, Inc.

Inflation is moderating with some easy comparisons\nagainst last year’s numbers. Following the Fed’s most recent 0.25% rate\nhike (July 26), markets are likely convinced that we are at the end of the\nFed’s rate hiking campaign. As mentioned in prior reports, we believe the\ncurrent deflationary trend might be transitory due to inflation’s structural\nroots in deglobalization and decarbonization. But, we do agree that short-\nterm interest rates may be peaking. Potential accidents beyond banks in\ncommercial real estate and pension funding will continue to factor into\nmonetary decisions. The higher interest costs on the U.S. government debt\nburden alone should be factored into future decisions as they significantly\ncontribute to mounting deficits.\nWe are equally interested in the path of the U.S. dollar, which has been\ndeclining for nine months. For years, some have predicted the decline of the\nU.S. dollar’s global reserve status with nothing to prove the theory. There is\nnow proof, given that more international trade deals are being conducted\nusing non-U.S. dollar domestic currencies among the competing countries or\ntrade blocks. A cheaper U.S. dollar will provide some debt relief for much of\nthe world, including the U.S. However, it will keep inflation elevated, providing\na tailwind for hard assets investments, an outcome we will welcome.\n5 | June 30, 2023\nSprott Focus Trust\nPerformance Review (Unaudited)\nCalendar Year Total Returns (%)\nFund Fund\nYear (NAV) Year (NAV)\n2022 0.1 2010 21.8\n2021 22.9 2009 54.0\n2020 6.8 2008 -42.7\n2019 32.7 2007 12.2\n2018 -17.0 2006 15.8\n2017 18.5 2005 13.7\n2016 24.8 2004 29.3\n2015 -11.1 2003 54.3\n2014 0.3 2002 -12.5\n2013 19.7 2001 10.0\n2012 11.4 2000 20.9\n2011 -10.5 1999 8.7\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

ORGANIZATION\nSprott Focus Trust, Inc. (the “Fund”) is a diversified closed-end investment company incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland. The Fund\ncommenced operations on March 2, 1988, and Sprott Asset Management LP (the “Adviser”) has had investment management responsibility for the Fund\nfrom the close of business on March 6, 2015 through the date of this Report. See Subsequent Events. Royce & Associates, LLC was the Fund’s previous\ninvestment manager.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund. These policies are in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nAt June 30, 2023, officers, employees of Sprott Inc. and its subsidiaries, Fund directors, and other affiliates owned approximately 48% of the Fund.\nA. Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities\nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nB. Portfolio Valuation and Methodologies\nSecurities are valued as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on the valuation date. All\nexchange traded securities are valued using the last trade or closing sale price from the primary publicly recognized exchange. If no current closing sale\nprice is available, the mean of the closing bid and ask price is used. If no current day price quotation is available, the previous business day’s closing sale\nprice is used. Investments in open-end mutual funds such as money market funds are valued at the closing NAV. Repurchase agreements are valued at\ncontract amount plus accrued interest, which approximates market value. The Fund values its non-U.S. dollar denominated securities in U.S. dollars daily\nat the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates as quoted by a major bank. If events (e.g., market volatility, company announcement or a natural disaster)\noccur that are expected to materially affect the value of the Fund’s investment, or in the event that it is determined that valuation results in a price for an\ninvestment that is deemed not to be representative of the market value of such investment, or if a price is not available, the investment will be valued in\naccordance with the Adviser’s policies and procedures as reflecting fair value (“Fair Value Policies and Procedures”). U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the\nprice a fund would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The\nBoard of Directors of the Fund (the “Board”) has approved the designation of the Adviser of the Fund as the valuation designee for the Fund. If a security’s\nmarket price is not readily available or does not otherwise accurately represent the fair value of the security, the security will be valued in accordance with\nthe Fair Value Policies and Procedures as reflecting fair value. The Adviser has formed a committee (the “Valuation Committee”) to develop pricing policies\nand procedures and to oversee the pricing function for all financial instruments.\nC. Fair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair valuation approaches that may be used by the Valuation Committee include market approach, income approach and cost approach. Valuation\ntechniques such as discounted cash flow, use of market comparables and matrix pricing are types of valuation approaches and are typically used in\ndetermining fair value. When determining the price for fair valued investments, the Valuation Committee seeks to determine the price that the Fund might\nreasonably expect to receive or pay from the current sale or purchase of that asset or liability in an arm’s-length transaction. Fair value determinations shall\nbe based upon all available factors that the Valuation Committee deems relevant and consistent with the principles of fair value measurement.\nVarious inputs are used in determining the value of the Fund’s investments, as noted above. These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels below:\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.\nLevel 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar securities, foreign securities that may be fair valued and repurchase agreements).\nLevel 3 – significant unobservable inputs.\nThe inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.\n15 | June 30, 2023\nSprott Focus Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) June 30, 2023\nThe following is a summary of the Fund’s investments as of June 30, 2023 based on the inputs used to value them. For a detailed breakout of common\nstocks by sector classification, please refer to the Schedule of Investments.\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCommon Stocks $ 242,658,741 $ — $ — $ 242,658,741\nRepurchase Agreements — 9,904,196 — 9,904,196\nSecurities Lending Collateral 7,500 — — 7,500\nTotal $ 242,666,241 $ 9,904,196 $ — $ 252,570,437\nThere were no transfers between levels for investments held at the end of the period.\nD. Investment Transactions and Related Investment Income\nInvestment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividend income is recorded\nat the fair market value of the securities received. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Premium and discounts on debt securities are amortized\nusing the effective yield-to-maturity method. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are determined on the basis of identified cost for\nbook and tax purposes.\nIncome received from foreign sources may result in withholding tax. Withholding taxes are accrued at the same time as the related income if the tax rate\nis fixed and known, unless a tax withheld is reclaimable from the local tax authorities in which case it is recorded as receivable. If the tax rate is not known\nor estimable, such expense or reclaim receivable is recorded when the net proceeds are received.\nE. Expenses\nThe Fund incurs direct and indirect expenses. Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund’s operations, while expenses applicable\nto more than one fund managed by the Adviser are allocated equitably.\nF. Compensating Balance Credits\nThe Fund has an arrangement with its custodian bank, whereby a portion of the custodian’s fee is paid indirectly by credits earned on the Fund’s cash on\ndeposit with the bank. This deposit arrangement is an alternative to purchasing overnight investments. Conversely, the Fund pays interest to the custodian\non any cash overdrafts, to the extent they are not offset by credits earned (interest accrued) on positive cash balances. The amount of credits earned on\nthe Fund’s cash on deposit amounted to $277 for the period ended June 30, 2023.\n3. RISKS\nA. Common Stock\nThe Fund invests a significant amount of assets in common stock. The value of common stock held by the Fund will fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and\nunpredictably, due to general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of common stock held by the Fund\nparticipate or factors relating to specific companies in which the Fund invests.\nB. Repurchase Agreements\nThe Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with institutions that the Fund’s investment adviser has determined are creditworthy. The Fund restricts\nrepurchase agreements to maturities of no more than seven days. Securities pledged as collateral for repurchase agreements, which are held until\nmaturity of the repurchase agreements, are marked-to-market daily and maintained at a value at least equal to the principal amount of the repurchase\nagreement (including accrued interest). Repurchase agreements could involve certain risks in the event of default or insolvency of the counter-party,\nincluding possible delays or restrictions upon the ability of the Fund to dispose of its underlying securities. The maturity associated with these securities\nis considered continuous.\nC. Foreign Currency\nThe Fund does not isolate the portion of the results of operations resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations\narising from changes in market prices of securities held. Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales and maturities of short-term\nsecurities, sales of foreign currencies, expiration of currency forward contracts, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates\non securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Fund’s books\nand the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in the value\nof assets and liabilities, including investments in securities at the end of the reporting period, as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n16 | June 30, 2023\nSprott Focus Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) June 30, 2023\nD. Metals and Mining Industry Risk\nCompanies in the metals and mining industry are susceptible to fluctuations in worldwide metal prices and extraction and production costs. In addition,\nmetals and mining companies may have significant operations in areas at risk for social and political unrest, security concerns and environmental damage.\nThese companies may also be at risk for increased government regulation and intervention. Such risks may adversely affect the issuers to which the Fund\nhas exposure.\n4. TAXES\nAs a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent that\nit distributes substantially all of its taxable income for its fiscal year.\n5. DISTRIBUTIONS\nThe Fund pays quarterly distributions on the Fund’s Common Stock at the annual rate of 6% of the rolling average of the prior four calendar quarter-\nend NAVs of the Fund’s Common Stock, with the fourth quarter distribution being the greater of 1.5% of the rolling average or the distribution required\nby IRS regulations. Distributions are recorded on ex-dividend date and to the extent that distributions are not paid from long-term capital gains, net\ninvestment income or net short-term capital gains, they will represent a return of capital. Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax\nregulations that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Permanent book and tax differences relating to\nstockholder distributions will result in reclassifications within the capital accounts. Undistributed net investment income may include temporary book and\ntax basis differences, which will reverse in a subsequent period. Any taxable income or gain remaining undistributed at fiscal year-end is distributed in the\nfollowing year.\n6. CAPITAL STOCK\nThe Fund issued 501,844 and 889,667 shares of Common Stock as reinvestments of distributions for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.\nOn June 9, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the Fund to repurchase 5% of shares of the Fund until June 30, 2024. Any such repurchase would take\nplace at the prevailing prices in the open market or in other transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the Fund’s share repurchases under its share repurchase program for the period ended June 30, 2023 and the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively:\nFor period For year ended\nended June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022\nDollar amount repurchased $ 6,057,870 $ 4,934,619\nShares repurchased 730,884 563,212\nAverage price per share (including commission) $8.21 $8.68\nWeighted average discount to NAV 5.74% 5.09%\n7. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement between the Adviser and the Fund provides for fees to be paid at an annual rate of 1.0% of the Fund’s average daily\nnet assets. The Fund accrued and paid investment advisory fees totaling $ 1,276,624 to the Adviser for the period ended June 30, 2023. The Adviser, on\nbehalf of the Fund, had entered into a Sub-Advisory Agreement with Sprott Asset Management USA Inc. (the “Sub-Adviser”), an affiliate of the Adviser. The\nSub-Adviser did not receive a separate sub-advisory fee under the Sub-Advisory Agreement for the period ending June 30, 2023.\n8. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2023, the costs of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, other than short-term securities,\namounted to $15,293,952 and $23,347,258, respectively.\n17 | June 30, 2023\nSprott Focus Trust\nNotes to Financial Statements (Unaudited) June 30, 2023\n9. LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES\nThe Fund, using State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) as its lending agent, may loan securities to qualified brokers and dealers in exchange\nfor negotiated lenders’ fees. The Fund receives cash collateral, which may be invested by the lending agent in short-term instruments. Collateral for\nsecurities on loan is at least equal to 102% (for loans of U.S. securities) or 105% (for loans of non-U.S. securities) of the market value of the loaned\nsecurities at the inception of each loan. The market value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any additional\nrequired collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business day. As June 30, 2023, the cash collateral received by the Fund was invested in the State\nStreet Navigator Securities Lending Government Money Market Portfolio, which is a 1940 Act registered money market fund. To the extent that advisory\nor other fees paid by the State Street Navigator Securities Lending Government Money Market Portfolio are for the same or similar services as fees paid\nby the Fund, there will be a layering of fees, which would increase expenses and decrease returns. Information regarding the value of the securities loaned\nand the value of the collateral at period end is included in the Schedule of Investments. The Fund could experience a delay in recovering its securities, a\npossible loss of income or value and record realized gain or loss on securities deemed sold due to a borrower’s inability to return securities on loan. These\nloans involve the risk of delay in receiving additional collateral in the event that the collateral decreases below the value of the securities loaned and\nthe risks of the loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities experience financial difficulties. When the Fund engages in securities\nlending, the Fund will retain a portion of the securities lending income and remit the remaining portion to State Street as securities lending agent as\ncompensation for its services. Securities lending income is generally equal to the total of income earned from the reinvestment of cash collateral (and\nexcludes collateral investment fees), and any fees or other payments to and from borrowers of securities. State Street bears all operational costs directly\nrelated to securities lending.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Fund had outstanding loans of securities to certain approved brokers for which the Fund received collateral:\nMarket Value of Market Value of Market Value of Total\nLoaned Securities Cash Collateral Non Cash Collateral Collateral\n$ 20,559,206 $ 7,500 $ 20,968,736 $20,976,236\nThe following table presents financial instruments, net of the related collateral received by the Portfolio as of June 30, 2023.\nGross Amounts Not Offset in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities\nGross Asset Amounts Presented in Financial Collateral Net Amount\nStatement of Assets and Liabilities(a) Instrument Received(b) (not less than $0)\n$20,559,206 $— $(20,559,206) $—\n(a) Represents market value of loaned securities at period end.\n(b) The actual collateral received is greater than the amount shown here due to collateral requirements of the security lending agreement.\nAll securities on loan are classified as Common Stock in the Fund’s Schedule of Investments as of June 30, 2023, with a contractual maturity of overnight\nand continuous.\nOther information regarding the Fund is available in the Fund’s most recent Report to Stockholders.

A shareholder should not draw any\nconclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount\nof this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution\nPolicy. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the 19(a)\nNotices are only estimates and are not being provided to shareholders for\ntax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts\nfor tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment\nexperience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to\nchanges based on tax regulations. The Fund will send shareholders a Form\n1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to report\nthese distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe Fund may in certain periods distribute more than its income and net\nrealized capital gains. In such instances, a portion of the distribution may\nbe a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when\nsome or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to\nyou. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s\ninvestment performance. For example, if the Fund generates a positive\ntotal return during a reporting period that is commensurate with its\ndistribution rate, and realizes net gains by selling portfolio securities, a\nsubstantial portion of its distribution will likely be characterized as capital\ngains; but if the Fund generated such commensurate returns but instead\ndid not realize net gains by selling portfolio securities during that period,\nthen a substantial portion of its distributions in most cases would largely be\ncharacterized as a “return of capital”, despite the fact that the distributions\nwere commensurate with those positive returns. Neither a capital gain\ndistribution nor a return of capital distribution should be confused with\n“yield” or “income.”\nMore details about the Funds’ distributions and the basis for these\nestimates are available on www.sprott.com.\n21 | June 30, 2023\nSprott Focus Trust\nAPPENDIX\n2023 19(a) Notices\n22 | June 30, 2023\nSPROTT FOCUS TRUST, INC.\nSprott Asset Management LP\nSuite 2600, South Tower\nRoyal Bank Plaza\n200 Bay Street\nToronto, Ontario\nCanada M5J 2J1\nTel: (855) 943-8099\nTel: (203) 636-0977\nNotification of Sources of Distributions\nPursuant to Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940\nQuarterly Distribution for Sprott Focus Trust, Inc.\nSprott Focus Trust, Inc.

(the “Fund”) met in person at a regularly scheduled meeting on June 9, 2023, in Watch Hill,\nRhode Island, for purposes of, among other things, considering whether it would be in the best interests of the Fund and its stockholders for the Board to\napprove the Amended Investment Advisory Agreement by and between the Fund and Sprott Asset Management USA, Inc. (the “Adviser”).\nIn connection with the Board’s review of the Agreement, the directors who were not “interested persons” of the Fund within the meaning of the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) (collectively, the “Independent Directors”) requested, and the Adviser provided the Board with,\ninformation about a variety of matters, including, without limitation, the following information:\n• nature, extent and quality of services to be provided by the Advisers, including background information on the qualifications and experience of\nkey professional of the Adviser personnel that provide services to the Fund;\n• investment performance of the Fund, including comparative performance information for registered investment companies similar to the Fund;\n• fees charged to and expenses of the Fund, including comparative fee and expense information for registered investment companies similar to\nthe Fund;\n• costs of the services provided, and profits realized by the Advisers;\n• and economies of scale.\nIn connection with the Board’s review of the Agreement, the Independent Directors considered the matters set forth above along with the\nfollowing information:\n• Whitney George’s long portfolio management tenure with the Fund and its historical investment performance;\n• Mr. George’s significant ownership and, thus, stake in the Fund; and\n• the Advisers’ experience in managing pooled investment vehicles and accounts.\nAt the June 9, 2023 meeting, the Board and the Independent Directors determined that the continuation of the Agreement was in the best interests of the\nFund in light of the services, personnel, expenses and such other matters as the Board considered to be relevant in the exercise of its reasonable business\njudgment and approved them.\nTo reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the 1940 Act as well as under the general principles of state law in reviewing and\napproving advisory contracts; the fiduciary duty of investment advisers with respect to advisory agreements and the receipt of investment advisory\ncompensation; the standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be\nconsidered by the Board in voting on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of each of the Agreement, the Independent Directors received\nmaterials in advance of the Board meeting from the Adviser. The Independent Directors also met with Mr. George. The Board applied its business judgment\nto determine whether the arrangement by and between the Fund and the Adviser are reasonable business arrangements from the Fund’s perspective as\nwell as from the perspective of its stockholders.\nNature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided\nSprott Asset Management USA, Inc.\nThe Board reviewed materials provided by the Adviser related to the proposed approval of the Advisory Agreement. The Board noted that the Adviser\nmanages approximate $2.0 billion in assets of December 31, 2022 and provides investment management services on a discretionary basis to its clients,\nwhich include individuals and institutional with separately managed accounts.\nThe Board further noted that the Adviser and the predecessor investment adviser of the Fund were each wholly-owned subsidiaries of Sprott, Inc. and both\nentities shared personnel and resources as they were part of the same organization. The Board reviewed the credentials of the key investment personnel\nthat would be responsible for servicing the Fund, noting that each had considerable experience in the asset management industry. The Board also noted\nthe fact that the change from one adviser to an affiliated adviser would not affect the back office, outsourced vendors, or management of the Fund. The\nBoard agreed that the Adviser’s services and ability to manage the Trust and the Fund had not materially changed with this internal corporate change. The\nBoard reviewed the credentials of the key investment personnel that would be responsible for servicing the Fund, noting Mr. George’s long tenure as the\nportfolio manager, value investing experience and background information on qualification/experience of senior management. The Board discussed the\nservices that would be provided to the Fund which included portfolio management, research, compliance and analysis. Additionally, the Board received\nsatisfactory responses from the representatives of the Adviser with respect to whether the Adviser was involved in any lawsuits or pending regulatory\n25 | June 30, 2023\nSprott Focus Trust\nBoard Review and Approval of Investment Advisory and Sub-Advisory Agreements\nactions. The Board reviewed the best-execution practices of the Adviser and discussed the various factors considered by the Adviser when selecting\nbrokers. The Board concluded that based on the responses in this questionnaire and their experience with the Adviser, they could expect the Adviser to\nprovide high quality service to the Funds and its shareholders.\nInvestment Performance\nThe Board observed that the Fund outperformed the peer group, Morningstar category and benchmark index for the 1-year and 3-year periods. The\nBoard further noted that the Fund underperformed the benchmark index for the 5-year and since inception periods. The Board consider the Adviser’s\nexplanations noting the performance differential over longer period is likely to be from the Fund’s disciplined valuation framework driving portfolio\nactivity and the longstanding underperformance of similarly disciplined value strategies vs. growth-oriented strategies. After further discussion, the Board\nconcluded that the Adviser had the potential to continue providing reasonable returns for the Fund.\nFees and Expenses\nThe Board noted that the Fund’s advisory fee of 1.00% was slightly below the peer group and Morningstar category medians. The Board reviewed the Fund’s\nnet expense ratio of 1.14% and acknowledged it was below the peer group and Morningstar category averages and medians. After further discussion, the\nBoard concluded that the advisory fee for the Fund was not unreasonable.\nProfitability\nThe Board reviewed the profitability analysis provided by the Adviser and noted that the adviser realized a profit in managing the Fund. The Board\nacknowledged the effort required to maintain and manage the Fund’s complex investment program and determined the adviser’s profitability was\nnot excessive.\nEconomies of Scale\nThe Board considered the existence of any economies of scale in the provision of services by the Advisers and whether those economies were shared with\nthe Fund through breakpoints in its management fees or other means, such as expense caps or fee waivers. The Board noted that the assets of the Fund\nwere too small to meaningfully consider economies of scale and the necessity of breakpoints. The Board concluded that the current fee structure for the\nFund was reasonable and that no changes were currently necessary.\nConclusion\nHaving requested and received such information from the adviser as the Board believed to be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the advisory\nagreement, and as assisted by the advice of counsel, the Board concluded that renewal of the advisory agreement was in the best interests of the Fund\nand its shareholders.\n26 | June 30, 2023\n[This page intentionally left blank]\n[This page intentionally left blank]\n\nwww.sprott.com"
