(Nasdaq: WBUY)** (“Webuy” or the “Company”), a Southeast Asian community e-commerce retailer, today announced that, following the receipt of a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”) on January 26, 2024 regarding the minimum bid price requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Minimum Bid Price Rule”) for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it received written notification from Nasdaq, providing an additional 180 calendar days, or until January 21, 2025, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price of U.S. $1.00, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule.\n\nUnder Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if at any time over this period the bid price of Webuy’s shares closes at U.S. $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days (save for Nasdaq’s discretion to require the Company to maintain a bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a period in excess more than ten consecutive business days, but generally no more than 20 consecutive business days), Nasdaq will provide written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed.\n\nVincent Xue Bin, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Webuy Global, stated, “We appreciate Nasdaq’s flexibility and support, and are committed to maintaining our listing. We continue to generate significant growth and our business fundamentals are stronger than ever. In addition, over the coming months, we look forward to unveiling a number of major initiatives underway that we expect will positively impact on our financial results. We remain laser-focused on driving value for shareholders and look forward to providing further updates.”\n\n**About Webuy Global Ltd**\n\nWebuy Global Ltd (Nasdaq: WBUY) is an innovative, technology-focused company with a goal of building the most trusted retail brand and advanced e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, designed to leverage data in order to provide a community-driven experience for consumers. The Company's unique 'group buy' business model is set to revolutionize traditional shopping practices, by offering substantial cost savings to customers through an efficient purchasing model and community-centric approach. Akin to group purchases and bulk orders, this approach simplifies the process for customers, eliminating the need for individual bulk purchases. Furthermore, the Company’s business model streamlines the traditional supply chain by minimizing the involvement of intermediaries, thereby offering a more direct \"farm-to-table\" supply model. The Company’s vision is to enable the ten million families in Southeast Asia to live a healthier, higher-quality lifestyle.

Each set will uphold Webuy’s high standards of quality at affordable prices.\n\nVincent Xue Bin, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Webuy, stated, “We are extremely pleased with the overwhelming customer response to the Plum Wine Gift set, and look forward to rolling out additional proprietary products within the Sing Select gift series through our established distribution channels.

Customers can access hundreds of insurance products spanning health, life, property, travel, and more, through Webuy's partnership with a leading insurance broker in Singapore.\n\nThe insurance referral program incentivizes Webuy's Group Leaders to promote insurance products and drive referrals within their communities. In turn, Group Leaders earn referral fees based on successful referrals, customers gain access to discounted policies, and insurance partners benefit from lower acquisition costs and higher retention through community engagement.\n\nVincent Xue Bin, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Webuy, commented, \"Our mission has always been to make everyday products and services more affordable and accessible through community group purchases. With our expansion into insurance referrals, we can leverage our growing community base to negotiate better rates and connect customers with coverage plans tailored to their individual needs. Our move into the insurance referral space unlocks a high-potential business that dovetails with our commitment to continuously evolve our offerings and scale into new markets. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on building our community network while generating long-term value for our shareholders.\"\n\n**About Webuy Global Ltd**\n\nWebuy Global Ltd (Nasdaq: WBUY) is an innovative, technology-focused company with the goal of building the most trusted retail brand and advanced e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, designed to leverage data in order to provide a community-driven experience for consumers. The Company's unique 'group buy' business model is set to revolutionize traditional shopping practices, by offering substantial cost savings to customers through an efficient purchasing model and community-centric approach. Akin to group purchases and bulk orders, this approach simplifies the process for customers, eliminating the need for individual bulk purchases. Furthermore, the Company's business model streamlines the traditional supply chain by minimizing the involvement of intermediaries, thereby offering a more direct \"farm-to-table\" supply model. The Company’s vision is to enable the ten million families in Southeast Asia to live a healthier, higher-quality lifestyle.

Webuy is committed to developing a community-oriented e-commerce platform in the Southeast Asia region and transforming the e-commerce model into a community-driven experience for consumers.\n\nThe Company's innovative 'group buy' business model is set to revolutionize traditional shopping practices, offering substantial cost savings to customers through a community-centric approach. This approach, akin to group purchases and bulk orders, simplifies the process for customers, eliminating the need for individual bulk purchases. Furthermore, the business model streamlines the traditional supply chain by minimizing the involvement of intermediaries, thereby offering a more direct \"farm-to-table\" supply model.

Its audience potentially includes tens of thousands of individual and institutional investors, as well as investment advisors and analysts. \n\nAll sessions will be conducted through video webcasts and will take place in the Eastern time zone. \n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis press release and the Conference contains forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we or our representatives may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. We base these forward-looking statements on our expectations and projections about future events, which we derive from the information currently available to us. You can identify forward-looking statements by those that are not historical in nature, particularly those that use terminology such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"contemplates,\" \"estimates,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"projected,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" or \"hopes\" or the negative of these or similar terms. In evaluating these forward-looking statements, you should consider various factors, including: our ability to change the direction of the Company; our ability to keep pace with new technology and changing market needs; and the competitive environment of our business. These and other factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statement.\n\nForward-looking statements are only predictions. The forward-looking events discussed in this press release and other statements made from time to time by us or our representatives, may not occur, and actual events and results may differ materially and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions about us. We are not obligated to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this press release and other statements made from time to time by us or our representatives might not occur.\n\nThis investor webinar may include references to non-US GAAP financial measures, which include: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins. Webuy uses these non-US GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparison, and Webuy’s management believes that these non-US GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of its recurring core business operating results. However, there are a number of limitations related to the use of non-US GAAP financial measures, and as such, the presentation of these non-US GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures determined in accordance with US GAAP reported on Form 20-F. In addition, these non-US GAAP financial measures may differ from non-US GAAP financial measures with comparable names used by other companies.\n\n**Contacts** Investor Relations Robin Yang, Partner

Registered attendees of the conference are encouraged to request a meeting with Mr. Xue by contacting your EF Hutton representative.\n\n**About Webuy Global Ltd**\n\nThe Company's mission is to make social shopping a new lifestyle for consumers and to empower consumers' purchases with an efficient, cost-saving purchasing model. Webuy is committed to developing a community-oriented e-commerce platform in the Southeast Asia region and transforming the e-commerce model into a community-driven experience for consumers.\n\nThe Company's innovative 'group buy' business model is set to revolutionize traditional shopping practices, offering substantial cost savings to customers through a community-centric approach.

Notable recent events include the Company’s launch of a travel business line in Indonesia and expansion into an insurance referral program. Key highlights of the Company’s 2023 financial achievements follow:\n\n**_2023 Financial Highlights_**\n\n  * **Total revenues** increased by 38.4% to US$61.7 million from US$44.6 million in the full year of 2022. The increase was mainly driven by sales of groceries in the Indonesian market and demand for the Company’s tour packages in Singapore.\n  * **Gross profit** increased by 38.4% to US$5.1 million from US$3.8 million in the full year of 2022. **Gross margin** was approximately 8.3%, relatively flat compared to 8.4% in the full year of 2022, mainly attributable to the Company’s ongoing efficiency optimization initiatives.\n\n\n\n**_Recent Developments_**\n\nIn early 2024, the Company launched its travel business in Indonesia and expanded its presence in the growing Southeast Asian tourism market.\n\nIn April 2024, the Company launched an insurance referral program to deliver insurance solutions to markets across Asia.\n\nVincent Xue Bin, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Webuy, commented, \"2023 was an important year in which we refined our strategic approach and delivered solid results. Sales of groceries on our platform in Indonesia grew strongly, as demand in the region escalated and our distribution strategies have proven effective. By expanding our footprint, further establishing our presence, and catering to the needs of the market, we grew our total revenues by 38.4%, with sales of groceries in Indonesia increasing by a substantial 83.6%. In addition to grocery sales, we introduced new packaged tour travel services in Singapore, which immediately proved popular with consumers. Revenue generated from tour packages offered in Singapore more than doubled from that of 2022, representing an important diversification of our product offerings. Building on this momentum, we leveraged our robust supply chain network to successfully extend our tour packages into Indonesia, further expanding our presence in the vibrant Southeast Asian tourism market. Additionally, our strategic entry into an insurance referral program during April represents a promising opportunity for higher-margin growth, aligning with our consistent approach to innovation and expansion.\"\n\n\"Our 2023 results stand as a testament to our innovative approach and the resilience of our business model. Furthermore, our stable gross margin underscores our commitment to continuous efficiency optimizations. Looking ahead, we remain steadfast in our dedication to surpassing existing milestones, ensuring unparalleled success for our customers, and consistently delivering enduring value to our shareholders while fostering a strong sense of community engagement.\"\n\n**Annual Report**\n\nThe Form 20-F can be accessed by visiting either the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or the Company's website at [https://www.webuysg.com/Investor/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3aR4sPrMbYc7vboXZUEoJON4vTE6qujAipBW4eyOE_oJfzvCf8el54Ll9cepqPlSsXq71kcm0K6WerGZOF2DHsr5nzOBgBDVK8oILFmCdYJVqyuUimq883zZuOBLopwf).
