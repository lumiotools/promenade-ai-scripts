The\nCompany may repurchase all or a portion of the authorized amount. The timing, as well as the number\nand value of any shares repurchased under the program, will be determined by the Company at its\ndiscretion under the Board authorized program and will depend on a variety of factors, including\nmanagement's assessment of the intrinsic value of the Company's ordinary shares, the market price of\nthe Company's ordinary shares, general market and economic conditions, available liquidity, alternative\ninvestment opportunities, and applicable legal requirements. The Repurchase Program does not obligate\nthe Company to repurchase any specific number of ordinary shares and may be suspended, modified or\ndiscontinued at any time without prior notice. The share repurchases will be funded from existing cash\nand cash equivalents. This notice is neither an offer to purchase nor a solicitation of an offer to by any\nsecurities.\nFor information about the Distribution, including the deadline for filing objections to the Distribution,\nplease contact Adv.

Our leading AI-driven solutions\nempower customers to confront significant, evolving threats, accelerate investigations, enable faster decision-\nmaking and mitigate a wide range of security challenges.”\n“Cognyte has grown revenue by more than 11% in the first six months of fiscal 2025,” said David Abadi, Cognyte’s\nchief financial officer. “We delivered $13.3 million in Adjusted EBITDA, marking a meaningful improvement\ncompared to almost breakeven results in the first half of the prior fiscal year. Our advanced solutions deliver\nsignificant value to our customers, driving demand. As a result of market conditions and our strong execution, we\nare once again raising our full year outlook.”\nFYE25 Outlook\nOur non-GAAP outlook for the year ending January 31, 2025 (“FYE25” and “Fiscal 2025”) is as follows:\n• Revenue: $347 million at the midpoint with a range of +/-2%, representing approximately 11% growth from\nprevious year revenue.\n• Adjusted EBITDA: Approximately $25 million at the midpoint of our revenue outlook.\n• Diluted EPS: Loss of $0.03 at the midpoint of our revenue outlook.\nOur non-GAAP outlook for FYE25 excludes the following GAAP measures which we are able to quantify with\nreasonable certainty, as described further below under “Supplemental Information About non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures and Operating Metrics”:\n• Amortization of intangible assets of approximately $0.3 million.\nOur non-GAAP outlook for FYE25 excludes the following GAAP measures for which we are able to provide a range\nof probable significance:\n• Stock-based compensation is expected to be between approximately $17.0 and $19.0 million, assuming\nmarket prices for our ordinary shares are generally consistent with current levels.\nFor additional information about our expectations for FYE25, please refer to the Q2 FYE25 conference call we will\nconduct on September 10, 2024.\nExhibit 99.1\nOur non-GAAP outlook does not include the potential impact of any business acquisitions that may close after the\ndate hereof, and, unless otherwise specified, reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent with\ncurrent rates.\nWe are unable, without unreasonable effort, to provide a reconciliation for other GAAP measures which are\nexcluded from our non-GAAP outlook, including the impact of future business acquisitions or acquisition expenses,\nfuture restructuring expenses, and non-GAAP income tax adjustments due to the level of unpredictability and\nuncertainty associated with these items. For these same reasons, we are unable to assess the probable\nsignificance of these excluded items. While historical results may not be indicative of future results, actual amounts\nfor the three and six months ended July 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively, for the GAAP measures excluded from\nour non-GAAP outlook appear in Table 4 of this press release.\nConference Call Information\nWe will conduct a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss our results for the three months ended July 31,\n2024.

Prior\nperiod comparative numbers were adjusted accordingly. The non-GAAP income tax provision, non-GAAP net loss\nattributable to Cognyte Software Ltd. and non-GAAP diluted net loss per share attributable to Cognyte Software Ltd.\nunder the previous method of calculation, which was presented in last year’s press release filing on September 12,\n2023, were $15.4 million, $22.3 million and $(0.32) for the six months ended July 31, 2023 and $4.8 million, $6.4\nmillion and $(0.09) for the three months ended July 31, 2023, respectively.\nExhibit 99.1\nCognyte Software Ltd. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Information About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe press release includes reconciliations of certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP,\nconsisting of non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margins, non-GAAP research and development\nexpenses, net, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating (loss) income and\noperating margins, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP provision for income taxes and non-GAAP\neffective income tax rate, non-GAAP net (loss) income attributable to Cognyte, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted\nEBITDA margin, non-GAAP diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to Cognyte and non-GAAP diluted\nweighted-average shares used in computing such measure. The tables above include a reconciliation of each non-\nGAAP financial measure for completed periods presented in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP\nfinancial measure.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures, used in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures,\nprovide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business by:\n• facilitating the comparison of our financial results and business trends between periods, by excluding certain\nitems that either can vary significantly in amount and frequency, are based upon subjective assumptions, or\nin certain cases are unplanned for or difficult to forecast,\n• facilitating the comparison of our financial results and business trends with other software companies who\npublish similar non-GAAP measures, and\n• allowing investors to see and understand key supplementary metrics used by our management to run our\nbusiness, including for budgeting and forecasting, resource allocation, and compensation matters.\nWe also make these non-GAAP financial measures available because our management believes they provide\nmeaningful information about the financial performance of our business and are useful to investors for informational\nand comparative purposes.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation as substitutes for, or superior to, comparable\nGAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures we present have limitations in that they do not reflect\nall of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-\nGAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the\ncorresponding GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent discretionary cash\navailable to us to invest in the growth of our business, and we may in the future incur expenses similar to or in addition\nto the adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate similar non-GAAP\nfinancial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are calculated by making the following adjustments to our GAAP financial\nmeasures:\nRevenue adjustments. We exclude from our non-GAAP revenue the impact of fair value adjustments required under\nGAAP relating to software and software service revenue and professional service and other revenue acquired in a\nbusiness acquisition, which would have otherwise been recognized on a stand-alone basis. We believe that it is useful\nfor investors to understand the total amount of revenue that we and the acquired company would have recognized on\na stand-alone basis under GAAP, absent the accounting adjustment associated with the business acquisition. We\nbelieve that our non-GAAP revenue measure helps management and investors understand our revenue trends and\nserves as a useful measure of ongoing business performance.\nAmortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire an entity, we are required\nunder GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the acquired entity and amortize those assets over\ntheir useful lives. We exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired technology, from our\nnon-GAAP financial measures because they are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted\nby the timing and size of acquisitions. We also exclude these amounts to provide easier comparability of pre and post-\nacquisition operating results.\nStock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses related to restricted stock\nawards, stock bonus programs, bonus share programs, and other stock-based awards from our non-GAAP financial\nExhibit 99.1\nmeasures. We evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock-based compensation\nis typically a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing, size and nature of awards\ngranted, and is influenced in part by certain factors which are generally beyond our control, such as the volatility of\nthe price of our ordinary shares. In addition, measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to varying valuation\nmethodologies and subjective assumptions, and therefore we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from\nour non-GAAP financial measures allows for meaningful comparisons of our current operating results to our historical\noperating results and to other companies in our industry.\nAcquisition expenses (benefit), net. In connection with acquisition activity (including with respect to acquisitions that\nare not consummated), we incur expenses, including legal, accounting, and other professional fees, integration costs,\nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, and other costs. Integration costs may consist of\ninformation technology expenses as systems are integrated across the combined entity, consulting expenses,\nmarketing expenses, and professional fees, as well as non-cash charges to write-off or impair the value of redundant\nassets. We exclude these expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are unpredictable, can\nvary based on the size and complexity of each transaction, and are unrelated to our continuing operations or to the\ncontinuing operations of the acquired businesses.\nRestructuring expenses. We exclude restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, which include\nemployee termination costs, facility exit costs, certain professional fees, asset impairment charges, and other costs\ndirectly associated with resource realignments incurred in reaction to changing strategies or business conditions. All\nof these costs can vary significantly in amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the\nchanging needs of our business and we believe that excluding them provides easier comparability of pre- and post-\nrestructuring operating results.\nSeparation expenses. On December 4, 2019, Verint announced its intention to separate into two independent publicly\ntraded companies: Cognyte Software Ltd., which consists of Verint’s Cyber Intelligence Solutions business, and Verint\nSystems Inc., which consists of its Customer Engagement Business. We incurred significant expenses to separate\nthe aforesaid businesses, including third-party advisory, accounting, legal, consulting, and other similar services\nrelated to the separation as well as costs associated with accelerated depreciation and amortization of assets which\nbecame obsolete following the separation from Verint, including those related to human resources, brand\nmanagement, real estate, and information technology to the extent not capitalized. These costs are incremental to\nour normal operating expenses and incurred solely as a result of the separation transaction. Accordingly, we are\nexcluding these separation expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to evaluate our performance\non a comparable basis.\nBusiness Divestiture gains/losses. In certain cases, we may divest a portion of our business, which may result in a\ngain or loss on divestiture. These gains or losses may result from the sale of a business unit or the termination of a\nproduct line or service. We exclude these gains or losses from our non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide\na more meaningful comparisons of our ongoing business performance between periods and to other companies in\nour industry. On December 1, 2022, as part of our ongoing strategic plan to simplify and focus the Company on fewer\nagendas, we sold our Situational Intelligence Solutions (SIS) business.\nProvision for legal claim. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures accrual recorded for the settlement of\ncertain legal claims related to our business acquisitions.\nOther adjustments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures rent expense for redundant facilities, gains\non change in fair value of equity investment, gains or losses on sales of property and certain professional fees\nunrelated to our ongoing operations.\nNon-GAAP income tax adjustments. We exclude our GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes from our non-GAAP\nmeasures of net income attributable to Cognyte Software Ltd., and instead include a non-GAAP provision for income\ntaxes. Cognyte uses a full-year non-GAAP tax rate to compute the non-GAAP tax provision. This full-year non-GAAP\ntax rate is based on Cognyte’s annual GAAP income, adjusted to exclude non-GAAP items, as well as the effects of\nsignificant non-recurring and period-specific tax items which vary in size and frequency. This annual non-GAAP tax\nrate is based on an evaluation of our historical and projected profit before tax, taking into account the impact of non-\nGAAP adjustments, tax law changes, as well as other factors such as our current tax structure, existing tax positions\nand expected recurring tax incentives. Our GAAP effective income tax rate can vary significantly from year to year as\na result of tax law changes, settlements with tax authorities, changes in the geographic mix of earnings including\nacquisition activity, changes in the projected realizability of deferred tax assets, and other unusual or period-specific\nevents, all of which can vary in size and frequency. We believe that our non-GAAP effective income tax rate removes\nExhibit 99.1\nmuch of this variability and facilitates meaningful comparisons of operating results across periods. We evaluate our\nnon-GAAP effective income tax rate on an ongoing basis, and it can change from time to time. Our non-GAAP income\ntax rate can differ materially from our GAAP effective income tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest before\ninterest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, revenue adjustments,\nrestructuring expenses, acquisition expenses, and other expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures\nas described above. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating\nperformance between companies because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures,\nincome taxes, stock-based compensation accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies. Adjusted\nEBITDA is also used by credit rating agencies, lenders, and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness.\nSupplemental Information About Constant Currency\nBecause we operate on a global basis and transact business in many currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates can affect our consolidated U.S. dollar operating results. To facilitate the assessment of our\nperformance excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we calculate our GAAP and non-\nGAAP revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses on both an as-reported basis and a constant currency basis,\nallowing for comparison of results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant. We\nperform our constant currency calculations by translating current-period foreign currency results into U.S. dollars\nusing prior-period average foreign currency exchange rates or hedge rates, as applicable, rather than current period\nexchange rates. We believe that constant currency measures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends.\nUnless otherwise indicated, our financial outlook for each of revenue, operating margin, and diluted earnings per\nshare, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis, reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent\nwith rates in effect when the outlook is provided.\nWe also incur foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets\nand liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. Our financial outlook for\ndiluted earnings per share includes net foreign exchange gains or losses incurred to date, if any, but does not include\npotential future gains or losses."
