We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide analysts, investors, lenders, and other third parties with insights into how we evaluate normal operational activities, including our ability to generate cash from operations, on a comparable year-over-year basis and manage our budgeting and forecasting. In addition, certain non-GAAP financial measures, primarily adjusted EBITDA, are used to measure performance when determining components of annual compensation for substantially all non-sales force employees, including senior management.\n\nWe may discuss the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP in our quarterly and annual reports, earnings press releases, and conference calls.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, as used by us, may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nThere are several limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income or loss, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent, such as:\n\n  * adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA;\n  * adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;\n  * adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the benefit from or provision for income taxes or the cash requirements to pay taxes;\n  * adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n  * we exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA although: (i) it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and (ii) if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position;\n  * we exclude impairment expenses from adjusted EBITDA and, although these are non-cash expenses, the asset(s) being impaired may have to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA;\n  * we exclude restructuring expenses from adjusted EBITDA. Restructuring expenses primarily include employee severance and contract termination costs that are not related to acquisitions. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring expenses are not part of our underlying business;\n  * we exclude litigation settlements from adjusted EBITDA, as well as any applicable income items or credit adjustments due to subsequent changes in estimates. This does not include our legal fees to defend claims, which are expensed as incurred;\n  * we exclude acquisition related expenses as the amount and/or frequency of these expenses are not part of our underlying business. Acquisition related expenses include transaction costs, which primarily consisted of financial advisory, banking, legal, and regulatory fees, and other consulting fees, incurred to complete the acquisition, employee-related expenses (severance cost and benefits) for terminated employees after the acquisition, and miscellaneous other acquisition related expenses incurred;\n  * we exclude recognition of the step-up basis in inventory from acquisitions (i.e., the adjustment to record inventory from historic cost to fair value at acquisition) as the adjustment does not reflect the ongoing expense associated with sale of our products as part of our underlying business;\n  * we exclude losses on extinguishments of debt as these expenses are episodic in nature and do not directly correlate to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis; and\n  * we exclude other expenses, from time to time, that are episodic in nature and do not directly correlate to the cost of operating our business on an ongoing basis.\n\n\n\n_Adjusted Operating Expenses_\n\nAdjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations.\n\n_Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share_\n\nAdjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude significant income and expense items that are non-cash or not indicative of ongoing operations, including consideration of the tax effect of the adjustments. Adjusted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents adjusted net income per share. Adjusted weighted-average shares - diluted is calculated in accordance with the treasury stock, if-converted, or contingently issuable accounting methods, depending on the nature of the security.\n\nReconciliations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release.\n\nThe Company has not provided a reconciliation of its full-year 2024 guidance for adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating expenses to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because the Company is unable to predict, without unreasonable efforts, the timing and amount of items that would be included in such a reconciliation, including, but not limited to, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expense and litigation settlements. These items are uncertain and depend on various factors that are outside of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted. While the Company is unable to address the probable significance of these items, they could have a material impact on GAAP net income and operating expenses for the guidance period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating expenses would imply a degree of precision and certainty as to these future items that does not exist and could be confusing to investors.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

As such, the non-GAAP effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 27.9% and 24.7%, respectively; and the non-GAAP effective tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 26.0% and 22.8%, respectively.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Adjusted weighted-average shares - diluted were calculated using the “if-converted” method for our convertible notes in accordance with ASC 260, _Earnings per Share_. As such, adjusted weighted-average shares – diluted includes shares related to the assumed conversion of our convertible notes and the associated cash interest expense added-back to non-GAAP adjusted net income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjusted weighted-average shares – diluted includes 6,606,305 and 7,509,104 shares, respectively, attributable to our convertible notes. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjusted weighted-average shares – diluted includes 6,606,305 and 6,530,392 shares, respectively, attributable to our convertible notes. In addition, adjusted earnings per share includes other potentially dilutive securities to the extent that they are not antidilutive.  \n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2OTA1MCM2NTY5NDU4IzIwMTg3MjM=)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/ZjhiOTA1NmYtMWIyMS00NTFkLWFhNjQtYWMxM2FkOTdkZDZiLTEwMzAyOTY=/tiny/Collegium-Pharmaceutical-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/c9077b27-1a69-42a5-9f77-e39124f4d2a2/small/collegium-rgb-large-r-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c9077b27-1a69-42a5-9f77-e39124f4d2a2)\n\nSource: Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc.\n"

Michael Heffernan, who has served as Interim President and CEO since May 2024, will remain Chairman of the Board.\n\nMr. Karnani has more than 15 years of leadership experience in the life sciences industry. Over the course of nearly a decade at Horizon Therapeutics, Mr. Karnani held leadership positions spanning many aspects of the business, including leading Horizon’s growth strategy and its transformation into a leader in rare disease medicines as well as establishing and expanding Horizon’s presence in international markets.

I am excited to join Collegium at this pivotal time and work with this accomplished team to lead the business as we build a leading, diversified specialty pharmaceutical company.”\n\nVikram Karnani most recently served as Executive Vice President and President, Global Commercial Operations and Medical Affairs (Rare Disease) at Amgen, where he was responsible for driving the global commercial strategy for Amgen’s portfolio of rare disease medicines. Prior to joining Amgen through its 2023 acquisition of Horizon, Mr. Karnani held numerous roles of increasing responsibility at Horizon that culminated in his position as Executive Vice President and President of Global Commercial and Medical Affairs, responsible for Horizon’s portfolio of rare disease medicines. Before joining Horizon in 2014, Mr. Karnani served as Vice President of the Therapeutics and Cell Therapy business and held leadership roles in strategy and business development at Fresenius Kabi.
