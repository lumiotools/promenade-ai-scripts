(“Align”) (Nasdaq: ALGN) a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® System of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today announced that it has received CE Mark in Europe under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) for Align’s Invisalign® Palatal Expander System. The Invisalign Palatal Expander System has also completed registration with MHRA for the United Kingdom and overseas territories. \n\nBoth approvals are for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens, and adults (with surgery or other techniques). \n\nThese approvals mark a significant milestone in Align’s efforts to enhance clinical outcomes and efficiency in orthodontics. \n\nThe Invisalign Palatal Expander System is a modern and innovative direct 3D printed device based on proprietary and patented technology. Invisalign Palatal Expanders are intended for use in rapid expansion and subsequent holding of skeletal and/or dental narrow maxilla (upper jaw) with primary, mixed, or permanent dentition during treatment of patients. \n\n“The Invisalign Palatal Expander is an example of Align’s continuous commitment to innovative digital orthodontics by delivering products with greater efficiency for doctors and better treatment experiences for young patients,” said Simon Beard, Align Technology executive vice president and managing director, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). “We are thrilled to extend the availability of this transformative alternative to traditional palatal expanders to doctors and their patients across the EMEA region.” \n\nThe Invisalign Palatal Expander System consists of a series of removable devices staged in small increments of movement to expand a patient’s narrow maxilla to a position determined by their treating doctor. Each direct 3D printed device is customized to the patient’s unique anatomy based on an iTero™ intraoral digital scan. A palatal expansion treatment plan and device design are then developed using Align’s proprietary orthodontic software. \n\nWith Invisalign First™ aligners and Invisalign Palatal Expanders, Align Technology can provide doctors with a full early intervention treatment solution for Phase 1 treatment, an early interceptive orthodontic treatment for young patients. Phase 1 treatment is traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces, before all permanent teeth have erupted – typically at ages 6 through 10. Invisalign First clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients’ malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition, and predictable dental arch expansion. \n\n“Phase 1 or early interceptive treatment accounts for 20 percent of orthodontic case starts each year and is growing,” said Dr. Mitra Derakhshan, Align Technology executive vice president, chief clinical officer. “Together with Invisalign First aligners, Invisalign Palatal Expanders enables Align Technology to provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal and dental malocclusions in growing children. The addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal and dental jaw imbalances and bite correction for their growing patients during their teenage years.” \n\nThe Invisalign Palatal Expander System is expected to be commercially available across EMEA in Q1 2025. \n\n**About Align Technology, Inc.**\n\nAlign Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign® System, iTero™ intraoral scanners and services, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software. These technology building blocks enable enhanced digital orthodontic and restorative workflows to improve patient outcomes and practice efficiencies for over 271 thousand doctor customers and is key to accessing Align’s 600 million consumer market opportunity worldwide. Over the past 27 years, Align has helped doctors treat approximately 18.9 million patients with the Invisalign System and is driving the evolution in digital dentistry through the Align™ Digital Platform, our integrated suite of unique, proprietary technologies and services delivered as a seamless, end-to-end solution for patients and consumers, orthodontists and GP dentists, and lab/partners.

The Invisalign Palatal Expander System is intended for the orthodontic treatment of malocclusion. The system is used for the rapid expansion and subsequent holding of skeletal and/or dental narrow maxilla (upper jaw, dental arch and teeth, palate) with primary, mixed, or permanent dentition during orthopedic treatment in children or adolescents. In adults, it is to be used in conjunction with surgery or other interventions when necessary. Devices are 3D printed and are manufactured based on digital scan data from commercially available iTero™ intraoral scanners offered by Align Technology, Ltd. The devices are removable for better oral hygiene1; manufactured to custom fit each patient’s anatomy for optimal comfort and aesthetics, expanders fit comfortably in the patient’s mouth and are changed daily (no screw required). \n\nThe System is comprised of Invisalign Palatal Expanders (active expansion, each stage comes with a programmed expansion of up to 0.25mm/stage, changed daily or as per doctor’s discretion) and Invisalign Palatal Holders (copies of the last stage ​of the expansion phase designed to hold the maxilla post-active expansion and changed every 2-4 weeks as directed by the treating doctor), Invisalign Attachment Templates and proprietary 3D shape generation software. These products are not available for purchase by the general public. However, the products are available for purchase from Invisalign® trained dentists and orthodontists. \n\nThe Invisalign Palatal Expander System is currently available in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Singapore, and is expected to be available in additional markets, pending regulatory approvals. The Invisalign Palatal Expander System is expected to be commercially available across EMEA in Q1 2025. \n\n1Based on the survey in August 2023 in CAN of 10 Invisalign trained orthodontists who participated in the Invisalign® Palatal Expander System Technical Design Assessment and have treated at least 1 patient age 6-11 years with IPE, who responded to the question: “Please indicate your agreement with the following statement: Patients treated with the Invisalign® Palatal Expander System experience better oral hygiene than those patients treated with traditional palatal expanders (such as Schwartz, Hyrax, etc.)”. Agreement scale is 1-4 with 1 being “strongly disagree” and 4 being “strongly agree”.

(Nasdaq: ALGN), a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® System of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today reported financial results for the third quarter (\"Q3'24\"). Q3'24 total revenues were $977.9 million, down 4.9% sequentially and up 1.8% year-over-year. Q3'24 total revenues were not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately $14.6 million or 1.5% year-over-year.(1) Q3'24 Clear Aligner revenues were $786.8 million, down 5.4% sequentially and down 1.0% year-over-year. Q3'24 Clear Aligner revenues were not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially, and unfavorably impacted by approximately $11.7 million or 1.5% year-over-year.(1) Q3'24 Clear Aligner volume was down 4.0% sequentially and up 2.5% year-over-year. Q3'24 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues were $191.0 million, down 2.9% sequentially and up 15.6% year-over-year. Q3'24 Imaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services revenues were not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially and unfavorably impacted by approximately $2.9 million or 1.5% year-over-year.(1)\n\nQ3'24 operating income was $162.3 million resulting in an operating margin of 16.6%, up 2.3 points sequentially, and down 0.7 points year-over-year. Q3'24 operating margin was not significantly impacted by foreign exchange sequentially and was unfavorably impacted by approximately 0.8 points year-over-year.(1) On a non-GAAP basis, Q3'24 operating income was $215.9 million resulting in an operating margin of 22.1%, down 0.2 points sequentially, and up 0.3 points year-over-year. Q3'24 net income was $116.0 million, or $1.55 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3'24 net income was $175.6 million, or $2.35 per diluted share. \n\nCommenting on Align's Q3'24 results, Align Technology President and CEO Joe Hogan said, “Overall, Q3’24 results were mixed and reflect strong Systems and Services year-over-year revenue growth, as well as good Clear Aligner volume in the Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America regions, partially offset by declines in the U.S. As recently reported by many analysts and third-party research firms, the underlying dental market in the U.S. remains sluggish and our doctor customers cite similar trends. Q3’24 revenues of approximately $978 million increased 1.8% year-over-year and Clear Aligner volume of 617.2 thousand were up 2.5% year-over-year. Despite strong growth from Systems and Services revenues, a record 87.4 thousand doctor submitters, a record 236 thousand teens starting treatment—driven by a record teen case starts in China, and a record 25K+ of DSP Invisalign® Touch-Up cases, total revenues for Q3 were slightly below our Q3 revenue outlook in part due to more pronounced seasonality for clear aligners than expected, as well as continued weak consumer sentiment and a soft dental market in the U.S. Q3’24 non-GAAP operating margin of 22.1% was better than expected and increased year-over-year compared to 21.8% in Q3’23.” \n\n**Financial Summary - Third Quarter Fiscal 2024**\n\n**Q3'24** |  Q2'24  |  Q3'23  |  _Q/Q Change_ |  _Y/Y Change_  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nClear Aligner Shipments*  |  **617,220** |  642,725  |  602,335  |  _(4.0)%_ |  _+2.5%_  \n**GAAP**  \nNet Revenues  |  **$977.9M** |  $1,028.5M |  $960.2M |  _(4.9)%_ |  _+1.8%_  \nClear Aligner  |  **$786.8M** |  $831.7M |  $794.9M |  _(5.4)%_ |  _(1.0)%_  \nImaging Systems and CAD/CAM Services  |  **$191.0M** |  $196.8M |  $165.3M |  _(2.9)%_ |  _+15.6%_  \nNet Income  |  **$116.0M** |  $96.6M |  $121.4M |  _+20.1%_ |  _(4.5)%_  \nDiluted EPS  |  **$1.55** |  $1.28 |  $1.58 |  _+$0.27_ |  _( $0.03)_  \n**Non-GAAP**  \nNet Income  |  **$175.6M** |  $181.0M |  $164.3M |  _(3.0)%_ |  _+6.9%_  \nDiluted EPS  |  **$2.35** |  $2.41 |  $2.14 |  _( $0.06)_ |  _+$0.21_  \n_Changes and percentages are based on actual values.

Costco members in the in the U.S. can purchase an Invisalign treatment e-card and Invisalign™ Essentials Bundle+ on [Costco.com](http://Costco.com) for $99.99 to receive a $400 discount off Invisalign treatment with participating U.S. Invisalign providers. \n\n\n\n**Q4'24 Stock Repurchase**\n\n  * As of September 30, 2024, $500.0 million remains available for repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program approved in January 2023. \n  * Beginning in Q4'24 and continuing into the first quarter of 2025, we expect to repurchase up to $275.0 million of our common stock through either, or a combination of, open market repurchases or an accelerated stock repurchase agreement. \n\n\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Business Outlook**\n\nTurning to our outlook, assuming no circumstances occur beyond our control, including foreign exchange, we provide the following business outlook: \n\n  * For Q4'24, we expect worldwide revenues to be in the range of $995M to $1,015M\n  * For Q4'24, we expect Clear Aligner volume and ASP to be slightly up sequentially \n  * We also expect Systems and Services revenue to be up in Q4'24 sequentially consistent with typical Q4 seasonality \n  * We expect Q4’24 GAAP operating margin to be slightly lower than 14.0% primarily due to restructuring charges related to severance as we adjust headcount for the existing business environment. We estimate these restructuring charges to impact Q4’24 GAAP operating margin by approximately 3 points \n  * We anticipate Q4’24 non-GAAP operating margin to be slightly up sequentially \n  * For fiscal 2024, we expect investments in capital expenditures to be above $100M. Capital expenditures primarily relate to building construction and improvements as well as manufacturing capacity in support of continued expansion \n\n\n\n**Align Webcast and Conference Call**\n\nWe will host a conference call today, October 23, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. ET, 1:30 p.m. PT, to review our Q3'24 results, discuss future operating trends, and our business outlook.

We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the performance of our business. \n\nThere are material limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures as they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results, which can limit their usefulness for comparison purposes. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these limitations by analyzing current and future results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures in our public disclosures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meant to be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, superior to, or in isolation from, the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge investors to review the reconciliation of our GAAP financial measures to the comparable non-GAAP financial measures included herein and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned \"Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.\" \n\n**About Align Technology, Inc.**\n\nAlign Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign® System, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, iTero™ intraoral scanners and services, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software.
