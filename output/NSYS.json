This innovative technology, which integrates cutting-edge transceivers, receivers, and optical fiber within a non-magnetic cable or connector assembly designed to operate in magnetically sensitive environments, is set to transform data transmission capabilities across a range of sectors, including medical imaging, avionics, wireless communications, scientific instrumentation and industrial applications. \n\nNortech last week announced the consolidation of all wire and cable production for Aerospace and Defense customers to its Bemidji facility. This move follows four years of strategic investments in research and development, significantly upgrading the fiber optic manufacturing capabilities at the Bemidji location. By centralizing production, Nortech aims to grow the fiber optic business, enhance operational efficiency, bolster product quality, and reinforce its commitment to innovation and sustainability within the industry. \n\nNortech's AOX technology is a significant leap forward in the realm of data connectivity and management, providing a hybrid design that far exceeds the data transmission capabilities of traditional copper cables while offering power and signal delivery. By incorporating fiber optics and minimizing magnetic content, the highly ruggedized AOX enhances performance and does so in an environmentally sustainable manner. This aligns with Nortech Systems' commitment to innovation and sustainability, reflecting the Company's broader ethos of pushing the boundaries of what's possible in digital connectivity and manufacturing technologies. \n\nThe incorporation of fiber optics allows AOX cables to offer a litany of benefits over traditional data transfer methods, including substantially increased data transfer speeds, EMI immunity, managed voltage drop, with flexibility and durability across longer distances. This makes AOX uniquely suitable for high-performance data communications that cannot impact magnetically sensitive applications. \n\n\"Nortech Systems is proud to announce the patent of our Active Optical Xtreme technology that works in sophisticated magnetic environments, a testament to our team's dedication to innovation, hard work and excellence in the field of digital connectivity solutions,\" said Jay D. Miller, CEO of Nortech Systems. \"AOX represents not only a significant advancement in our product offerings but also underscores our commitment to providing state-of-the-art solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients to deliver products that offer lighter weight, lower cost, and durable solutions in a sustainable manner.\" \n\nThe AOX platform is expected to see increased adoption as industries seek more efficient and reliable methods to manage and transmit data in applications where sophisticated magnetic performance is required. The patent and subsequent implementation of AOX technologies are poised to set a new standard of digital data transfer in magnetically sensitive environments, reinforcing Nortech Systems' position as a leader in the global electronics manufacturing services (EMS) market. AOX for Non-Magnetic Applications is the Company's second patent in its technology portfolio. AOX adoption will ramp up through 2024 and will not have a material impact on Nortech's 2024 or 2025 financial results. \n\nFor more information about Active Optical Xtreme and other Nortech Systems solutions, please visit [www.nortechsys.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nortechsys.com&esheet=54003294&newsitemid=20240521209711&lan=en-US&anchor=www.nortechsys.com&index=1&md5=81495884f52d00bc86a4240e9e6c7311). \n\n**About Nortech Systems Incorporated**\n\nNortech Systems is a leading provider of design and manufacturing solutions for complex electromedical devices, electromechanical systems, assemblies, and components.

While this release is based on management's best judgment and current expectations, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, without limitation: (1) commodity cost increases coupled with challenges in raising prices and/or customer pressure to reduce prices; (2) supply chain disruptions leading to shortages of critical components; (3) volatility in market conditions which may affect demand for the Company's products; (4) increased competition; (5) changes in the reliability and efficiency of operating facilities or those of third parties; (6) risks related to the availability of labor; (7) the unanticipated loss of any key member of senior management; (8) geopolitical, economic, financial and business conditions; (9) the Company's ability to steadily improve manufacturing output and product quality throughout the remainder of 2024 or (10) the impact of global health epidemics on our customers, employees, manufacturing facilities, suppliers, the capital markets and our financial condition. Some of the above-mentioned factors are described in further detail in the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in our annual and quarterly reports, as applicable. You should assume the information appearing in this document is accurate only as of the date hereof, or as otherwise specified, as our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since such date. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements. \n\n**Reconciliation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") Measures to Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management that we believe provides useful information to investors because it reflects ongoing performance excluding certain non-recurring items during comparable periods and facilitates comparisons between peer companies since interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization can differ greatly between different organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, plus income tax expense plus depreciation expense and amortization expense. EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. It is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to revenue or net income, as applicable, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other businesses. EBITDA has limitations as an analytical metric, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. \n\n**THREE MONTHS ENDED**  \n---  \n**MARCH 31,**  \n**CONDENSED INCOME STATEMENTS** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n(in thousands USD, except share and per share amounts)   \nNet sales  |  $  |  34,215  |  $  |  34,888   \nCost of goods sold  |  28,767  |  29,404   \nGross profit  |  5,448  |  5,484   \nOperating expenses:   \nSelling expenses  |  805  |  890   \nGeneral and administrative expenses  |  3,170  |  3,265   \nResearch and development expenses  |  318  |  276   \nTotal operating expenses  |  4,293  |  4,431   \nIncome from operations  |  1,155  |  1,053   \nOther expense   \nInterest expense  |  (167  |  )  |  (110  |  )   \nTotal other expense  |  (167  |  )  |  (110  |  )   \nIncome before income taxes  |  988  |  943   \nIncome tax expense  |  223  |  262   \nNet income  |  $  |  765  |  $  |  681   \nIncome per common share:   \nBasic  |  $  |  0.28  |  $  |  0.25   \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic  |  2,741,345  |  2,692,033   \nDiluted  |  $  |  0.26  |  $  |  0.23   \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - dilutive  |  2,907,291  |  2,903,635   \nOther comprehensive income   \nForeign currency translation (loss) gain  |  (183  |  )  |  40   \nComprehensive income, net of tax  |  $  |  582  |  $  |  721   \n  \n**CONDENDSED BALANCE SHEETS** ($ in thousands)  |  **MARCH 31, 2024** |  **DECEMBER 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**ASSETS**  \nCurrent assets:   \nCash  |  $  |  4,028  |  $  |  960   \nRestricted cash  |  -  |  715   \nAccounts receivable, less allowances of $292 and $358, respectively  |  16,051  |  19,279   \nInventories, net  |  22,951  |  21,660   \nContract assets  |  14,194  |  14,481   \nPrepaid assets and other assets  |  1,892  |  1,698   \nTotal current assets  |  59,116  |  58,793   \nProperty and equipment, net  |  6,134  |  6,513   \nOperating lease assets, net  |  7,339  |  6,917   \nDeferred tax assets  |  2,640  |  2,641   \nOther intangible assets, net  |  223  |  263   \nTotal assets  |  $  |  75,452  |  $  |  75,127   \n**LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**  \nCurrent liabilities:   \nCurrent portion of finance lease obligations  |  $  |  296  |  $  |  356   \nCurrent portion of operating lease obligations  |  1,235  |  1,033   \nAccounts payable  |  15,217  |  15,924   \nAccrued payroll and commissions  |  4,771  |  4,138   \nCustomer deposits  |  3,139  |  4,068   \nOther accrued liabilities  |  1,063  |  1,063   \nTotal current liabilities  |  25,721  |  26,582   \nLong-term liabilities:   \nLong-term line of credit  |  6,170  |  5,815   \nLong-term finance lease obligations, net of current portion  |  168  |  209   \nLong-term operating lease obligations, net of current portion  |  6,977  |  6,763   \nOther long-term liabilities  |  410  |  414   \nTotal long-term liabilities  |  13,725  |  13,201   \nTotal liabilities  |  39,446  |  39,783   \nShareholders' equity:   \nPreferred stock, $1 par value;
