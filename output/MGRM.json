          "content": "Monogram Technologies Receives FDA Response for mBôs TKA\nSystem\nCompany Has 180 Days From Receipt to Produce Additional Information\nAUSTIN, TX – October 2, 2024 – Monogram Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: MGRM) (\"Monogram\"\nor the \"Company\"), an AI-driven robotics company focused on improving human health with an\ninitial focus on orthopedic surgery, today announced that it has received an Additional\nInformation Request (“AIR”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on September\n30, 2024, regarding its 510(k) premarket filing submission for the Company’s mBôs TKA System\n(the “Application”).\nThe Application was submitted on July 19, 2024, and passed the initial FDA Administrative Review.\nThe FDA informed the Company that the FDA placed the Application on hold pending a complete\nresponse to the AIR. The FDA has informed the Company that the Company has 180 days from\nthe date of the AIR to provide a complete response to the AIR or the FDA will consider the\nApplication withdrawn.\n“We believe this response provides more transparency for Monogram’s path forward toward\nobtaining clearance and ultimately commercialization,” said Ben Sexson, CEO of Monogram\nTechnologies. “We feel the increased clarity regarding the potential suitability of Indian clinical\ndata is de-risking. Having just closed our upsized and oversubscribed $13 million public offering,\nMonogram will continue to execute on our strategic objectives. With growing surgeon support\nand market interest, we continue to believe in our thesis for orthopedic robotics and the value\nproposition of our proposed active robotic system. The highest priority for the Company remains\nobtaining FDA clearance as quickly and economically as possible. Management believes the FDA\nfeedback was comprehensive and provides a framework to execute.”\nAs the Company works to respond to the AIR, the Company, in parallel, will pursue a submission\nfor its active modality with Outside the United States (“OUS”) clinical data as it continues to work\nthrough the AIR for its semi-active system.\n“The Company has committed considerable resources to cadaveric system demos this quarter.\nWe feel the surgeon feedback and market interest is greatest for our hands-free, fully active\nsystem. We are increasingly confident such system could be a game-changing advancement for\nthe industry. This response provides more transparency for Monogram’s path forward toward\nobtaining clearance and ultimately commercialization,” Mr. Sexson continued.”\nUpcoming Milestones\n• Obtain regulatory clearance to conduct clinical trials in India with strategic partner Shalby\nHospitals, with clearance expected in early Q1 2025.\n• Conduct OUS live-patient surgery trials and submit clinical trial data to FDA, with clinical\ntrials expected to include 92 total knee replacement procedures with a 3 month clinical\nfollow-up.\n• Seek to obtain clearance for the mBôs™ TKA System.\n• Continue exploring domestic relationships.\n• Continue expanding international relationships (the Company will be exhibiting at Arab\nHealth in January 2025).\nAbout Monogram Technologies Inc.\nMonogram Technologies (NASDAQ: MGRM) is an AI-driven robotics company focused on\nimproving human health, with an initial focus on orthopedic surgery. The Company is developing\na product solution architecture to enable patient-optimized orthopedic implants at scale by\ncombining 3D printing, advanced machine vision, AI and next-generation robotics.\nMonograms mBôs precision robotic surgical system is designed to autonomously execute\noptimized paths for high-precision insertion of its FDA-cleared mPress press-fit implants. The goal\nis well balanced better-fitting bone sparing knee replacements. The Company initially intends to\nproduce and market robotic surgical equipment and related software, orthopedic implants, tissue\nablation tools, navigation consumables, and other miscellaneous instrumentation necessary for\nreconstructive joint replacement procedures. Other clinical and commercial applications for the\nmBôs with mVision navigation are also being explored.\nMonogram has obtained FDA clearance for mPress implants and applied for 510(k) clearance for\nits robotic products. The Company is required to obtain FDA clearance before it can market its\nproducts. Monogram cannot estimate the timing or assure the ability to obtain such clearances.\nThe Company believes that its mBôs precision robotic surgical assistants, which combine AI and\nnovel navigation methods (mVision), will enable more personalized knee implants for patients,\nresulting in well balanced better-fitting knee replacements with bone sparing implants.\nMonogram anticipates that there may be other clinical and commercial applications for its\nnavigated mBôs precision robot and mVision navigation.\nTo learn more, visit monogramtechnologies.com.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
