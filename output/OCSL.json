Adjusted total investment income was $95.0 million ($1.16 per share) and $385.9 million ($4.80 per share) for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year ended September 30, 2024, as compared with $95.6 million ($1.17 per share) and $376.4 million ($5.22 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and full year of 2023. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by lower interest income due to the impact of certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status, partially offset by higher original issue discount (\"OID\") acceleration from investment repayments and higher prepayment fee income. The increase for the full year was primarily driven by higher interest income, which was attributable to a larger investment portfolio and higher OID acceleration from investment repayments, higher prepayment and amendment fees and higher dividend income from the Company's investment in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (\"SLF JV I\"). This was partially offset by the impact of certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status.\n  * **GAAP net investment income** was $44.9 million ($0.55 per share) and $175.1 million ($2.18 per share) for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year, as compared with $44.6 million ($0.54 per share) and $180.7 million ($2.51 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and full year of 2023. The increase for the quarter was primarily driven by lower management fees (net of fees waived) and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher income-based (\"Part I\") incentive fees (net of fees waived) and lower total investment income. The decrease for the full year was primarily driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by higher total investment income, lower management fees and part I incentive fees (net of fees waived) and lower operating expenses.\n  * **Adjusted net investment income** was $45.2 million ($0.55 per share) and $179.3 million and ($2.23 per share) for the fourth fiscal quarter and full year, as compared with $45.2 million ($0.55 per share) and $177.8 million ($2.47 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 and full year of 2023. The increase on a total dollar basis for the full year was primarily driven by higher adjusted total investment income, lower management fees and part I incentive fees (net of fees waived) and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher interest expense.\n  * **Net asset value (\"NAV\") per share** was $18.09 as of September 30, 2024, down as compared with $18.19 and $19.63 as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decline from June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 primarily reflected losses on certain debt and equity investments.\n  * **Waived part I incentive fees** of $1.2 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, and, effective July 1, 2024, base management fees were reduced from an annual rate of 1.50% to 1.00% of total gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents.\n  * **Originated** $259.0 million of new investment commitments and received $338.3 million of proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The weighted average yield on new debt investments was 9.9%.\n  * **Total debt outstanding** was $1,660.0 million as of September 30, 2024. The total debt to equity ratio was 1.12x, and the net debt to equity ratio was 1.07x, after adjusting for cash and cash equivalents.\n  * **Liquidity** as of September 30, 2024 was composed of $64.0 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $907.5 million of undrawn capacity under the Company's credit facilities (subject to borrowing base and other limitations). Unfunded investment commitments were $311.4 million, or $284.3 million excluding unfunded commitments to the Company's joint ventures. Of the $284.3 million, approximately $247.6 million can be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies or other restrictions.\n  * **A quarterly cash distribution was declared** of $0.55 per share. The distribution is payable in cash on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record on December 16, 2024.\n\n\n\nArmen Panossian, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Chief Investment Officer, said, “The results for our fourth fiscal quarter were supported by a combination of robust origination activity and ongoing loan sales and repayments. We invested $259 million and realized $338 million from sales and repayments, underscoring the strength of our origination platform and investment process. In addition to this being our first quarter with our lower base management fee, we have announced another discretionary fee waiver as part of our commitment to maintaining shareholder value.”\n\n\"During the quarter, we successfully restructured several names that were previously on non-accrual status,” Panossian noted. “However, unique challenges that impacted a handful of additional portfolio companies caused a slight decline in NAV and additional names on non-accrual status. While this has been a challenging year, we remain confident in the overall credit quality of our portfolio and in our ability to achieve successful outcomes for our shareholders by leveraging the extensive resources and turnaround expertise of the Oaktree platform.”\n\n**Distribution Declaration**\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.55 per share. The distribution is payable in cash on December 31, 2024 to stockholders of record on December 16, 2024.\n\nDistributions are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company’s stockholders.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**For the three months ended** | **For the year ended**  \n---|---  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ | **September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **September 30, 2023(unaudited)** | **September 30 ,2024** | **September 30 ,2023**  \n**GAAP operating results:**  \nInterest income | $ | 83,626 | $ | 85,953 | $ | 94,732 | $ | 346,249 | $ | 348,765  \nPIK interest income | 6,018 | 6,149 | 5,544 | 20,832 | 19,764  \nFee income | 3,897 | 1,460 | 572 | 9,210 | 6,546  \nDividend income | 1,144 | 1,404 | 1,057 | 5,374 | 4,211  \n**Total investment income** | **94,685** | **94,966** | **101,905** | **381,665** | **379,286**  \nNet expenses | 49,764 | 50,391 | 54,407 | 206,613 | 198,511  \nExcise tax | — | — | — | — | (78 | )  \n**Net investment income** | **44,921** | **44,575** | **47,498** | **175,052** | **180,697**  \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes | (8,008 | ) | (43,455 | ) | (1,546 | ) | (117,147 | ) | (63,366 | )  \n**Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations** | **$** | **36,913** | **$** | **1,120** | **$** | **45,952** | **$** | **57,905** | **$** | **117,331**  \n**Total investment income per common share** | **$** | **1.15** | **$** | **1.16** | **$** | **1.32** | **$** | **4.75** | **$** | **5.26**  \n**Net investment income per common share** | **$** | **0.55** | **$** | **0.54** | **$** | **0.62** | **$** | **2.18** | **$** | **2.51**  \n**Net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes per common share** | **$** | **(0.10** | **)** | **$** | **(0.53** | **)** | **$** | **(0.02** | **)** | **$** | **(1.46** | **)** | **$** | **(0.88** | **)**  \n**Earnings (loss) per common share — basic and diluted** | **$** | **0.45** | **$** | **0.01** | **$** | **0.60** | **$** | **0.72** | **$** | **1.63**  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures****1****:**  \n**Adjusted total investment income** | **$** | **95,000** | **$** | **95,573** | **$** | **102,157** | **$** | **385,927** | **$** | **376,389**  \n**Adjusted net investment income** | **$** | **45,236** | **$** | **45,182** | **$** | **47,750** | **$** | **179,314** | **$** | **177,800**  \n**Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes** | **$** | **(8,322** | **)** | **$** | **(44,055** | **)** | **$** | **(1,668** | **)** | **$** | **(120,579** | **)** | **$** | **(40,175** | **)**  \n**Adjusted earnings (loss)** | **$** | **36,914** | **$** | **1,127** | **$** | **46,082** | **$** | **58,735** | **$** | **137,625**  \n**Adjusted total investment income per share** | **$** | **1.16** | **$** | **1.17** | **$** | **1.32** | **$** | **4.80** | **$** | **5.22**  \n**Adjusted net investment income per share** | **$** | **0.55** | **$** | **0.55** | **$** | **0.62** | **$** | **2.23** | **$** | **2.47**  \n**Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes per share** | **$** | **(0.10** | **)** | **$** | **(0.54** | **)** | **$** | **(0.02** | **)** | **$** | **(1.50** | **)** | **$** | **(0.56** | **)**  \n**Adjusted earnings (loss) per share** | **$** | **0.45** | **$** | **0.01** | **$** | **0.60** | **$** | **0.73** | **$** | **1.91**  \n  \n______________________1 See _Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ below for a description of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliations from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the Company's non-GAAP measures, including on a per share basis. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company and to review the Company’s performance without giving effect to non-cash income/gain/loss resulting from the merger of Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation (\"OCSI\") with and into the Company in March 2021 (the \"OCSI Merger\") and the merger of Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. (\"OSI2\") with and into the Company in January 2023 (the \"OSI2 Merger\") and, in the case of adjusted net investment income, without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data and ratios)_ | **September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **September 30, 2023**  \n**Select balance sheet and other data:**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 63,966 | $ | 96,321 | $ | 136,450  \nInvestment portfolio at fair value | 3,021,279 | 3,121,703 | 2,892,420  \nTotal debt outstanding (net of unamortized financing costs) | 1,638,693 | 1,697,164 | 1,600,731  \nNet assets | 1,487,811 | 1,496,133 | 1,515,764  \nNet asset value per share | 18.09 | 18.19 | 19.63  \nTotal debt to equity ratio | 1.12x | 1.16x | 1.10x  \nNet debt to equity ratio | 1.07x | 1.10x | 1.01x  \n  \nAdjusted total investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was $95.0 million and included $84.0 million of interest income from portfolio investments, $6.0 million of payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest income, $3.9 million of fee income and $1.1 million of dividend income. The $0.6 million quarterly decline in adjusted total investment income was attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in interest income, which resulted from the impact of certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status and was partially offset by higher OID acceleration from investment repayments, and $0.3 million of lower dividend income from the Company's investment in SLF JV I. This was partially offset by $2.4 million of higher fee income mainly driven by higher prepayment fees.\n\nAdjusted total investment income for the full year ended September 30, 2024 was $385.9 million and included $350.5 million of interest income from portfolio investments, $20.8 million of PIK interest income, $9.2 million of fee income and $5.4 million of dividend income. The $9.5 million year-over-year increase in adjusted total investment income was attributable to a $5.7 million increase in interest income, which was attributable to a larger investment portfolio and higher OID acceleration from investment repayments and was partially offset by the impact of certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status. Also contributing to the increase was $2.7 million of higher fee income from higher prepayment and amendment fees and a $1.1 million increase in dividend income from the Company's investment in SLF JV I.\n\nNet expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $49.8 million, down $0.6 million from the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by $2.5 million of lower management fees (net of fees waived), $0.5 million of lower interest expense due to the decrease in borrowings outstanding and lower reference rates and $0.2 million of lower professional fees, partially offset by $2.6 million of higher part I incentive fees (net of fees waived).\n\nNet expenses for the full-year ended September 30, 2024 totaled $206.6 million, up $8.1 million from the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase for the year was primarily driven by $17.0 million of higher interest expense due to the impact of rising interest rates on the Company's floating rate liabilities, partially offset by $5.5 million of lower part I incentive fees (net of fees waived) as a result of part I incentive fees waived by Oaktree during the year, $1.2 million of lower management fees (net of fees waived) and a $2.2 million decrease in operating expenses. Adjusted net investment income was $45.2 million ($0.55 per share) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was flat as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nAdjusted net investment income was $179.3 million ($2.23 per share) for the full year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to $177.8 million ($2.47 per share) for the year ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $1.5 million for the year reflected $9.5 million of higher adjusted total investment income, partially offset by $8.1 million of higher net expenses. The per share decrease for the year was driven by an increase in weighted average shares outstanding from the issuance of common shares.\n\nAdjusted net realized and unrealized losses, net of taxes, was $8.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting realized and unrealized losses on certain debt and equity investments. Adjusted net realized and unrealized losses, net of taxes, was $120.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2024, primarily reflecting realized and unrealized losses on certain debt and equity investments.\n\n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n_($ in thousands)_ | **September 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **September 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \nInvestments at fair value | $ | 3,021,279 | $ | 3,121,703 | $ | 2,892,420  \nNumber of portfolio companies | 144 | 158 | 143  \nAverage portfolio company debt size | $ | 22,000 | $ | 19,900 | $ | 19,800  \n**Asset class:**  \nFirst lien debt | 81.7 | % | 82.5 | % | 76.4 | %  \nSecond lien debt | 3.5 | % | 3.5 | % | 10.1 | %  \nUnsecured debt | 3.6 | % | 3.8 | % | 1.9 | %  \nEquity | 5.0 | % | 4.2 | % | 5.0 | %  \nJV interests | 6.1 | % | 6.0 | % | 6.6 | %  \n**Non-accrual debt investments:**  \nNon-accrual investments at fair value | $ | 114,292 | $ | 110,599 | $ | 48,743  \nNon-accrual investments at cost | 140,748 | 172,827 | 68,397  \nNon-accrual investments as a percentage of debt investments at fair value | 4.0 | % | 3.7 | % | 1.8 | %  \nNon-accrual investments as a percentage of debt investments at cost | 4.9 | % | 5.7 | % | 2.4 | %  \nNumber of investments on non-accrual | 9 | 8 | 4  \n**Interest rate type:**  \nPercentage floating-rate | 88.4 | % | 85.3 | % | 86.2 | %  \nPercentage fixed-rate | 11.6 | % | 14.7 | % | 13.8 | %  \n**Yields:**  \nWeighted average yield on debt investments1 | 11.2 | % | 11.9 | % | 12.7 | %  \nCash component of weighted average yield on debt investments | 10.0 | % | 10.6 | % | 11.2 | %  \nWeighted average yield on total portfolio investments2 | 10.7 | % | 11.5 | % | 12.0 | %  \n**Investment activity:**  \nNew investment commitments | $ | 259,000 | $ | 338,700 | $ | 87,500  \nNew funded investment activity3 | $ | 232,700 | $ | 293,200 | $ | 117,100  \nProceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales | $ | 338,300 | $ | 185,500 | $ | 364,400  \nNet new investments4 | $ | (105,600 | ) | $ | 107,700 | $ | (247,300 | )  \nNumber of new investment commitments in new portfolio companies | 9 | 11 | 3  \nNumber of new investment commitments in existing portfolio companies | 10 | 9 | 3  \nNumber of portfolio company exits | 23 | 3 | 16  \n  \n______________________1 Annual stated yield earned plus net annual amortization of OID or premium earned on accruing investments, including the Company's share of the return on debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, and excluding any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and OSI2 Merger.2 Annual stated yield earned plus net annual amortization of OID or premium earned on accruing investments and dividend income, including the Company's share of the return on debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, and excluding any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and OSI2 Merger.3 New funded investment activity includes drawdowns on existing revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments.4 Net new investments consists of new funded investment activity less proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $3.0 billion and was composed of investments in 144 companies. These included debt investments in 122 companies, equity investments in 42 companies, and the Company's joint venture investments in SLF JV I and OCSI Glick JV LLC (\"Glick JV\"). 22 of the equity investments were in companies in which the Company also had a debt investment.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, 94.2% of the Company's portfolio at fair value consisted of debt investments, including 81.7% of first lien loans, 3.5% of second lien loans and 9.0% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV. This compared to 82.5% of first lien loans, 3.5% of second lien loans and 9.0% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, there were nine investments on non-accrual status, which represented 4.9% and 4.0% of the debt portfolio at cost and fair value, respectively.

The decrease was primarily driven by SLF JV I’s use of leverage and unrealized depreciation in the underlying investment portfolio.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, SLF JV I had $375.8 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 48 portfolio companies.

Of the $284.3 million, approximately $247.6 million could be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies or other restrictions. The Company has analyzed cash and cash equivalents, availability under its credit facilities, the ability to rotate out of certain assets and amounts of unfunded commitments that could be drawn and believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to invest in market opportunities as they arise.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding, including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, was 6.7%, down from 7.0% as of June 30, 2024, primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates on the Company's floating rate liabilities.\n\nThe Company’s total debt to equity ratio was 1.12x and 1.16x as of each of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company's net debt to equity ratio was 1.07x and 1.10x as of each of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nOn a supplemental basis, the Company is disclosing certain adjusted financial measures, each of which is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP”). The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company and to review the Company’s performance without giving effect to non-cash income/gain/loss resulting from the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger and in the case of adjusted net investment income, without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. The presentation of the below non-GAAP measures is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\n\n  * **\"Adjusted Total Investment Income\" and \"Adjusted Total Investment Income Per Share\"** – represents total investment income excluding any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger.\n  * **“Adjusted Net Investment Income” and “Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share”** – represents net investment income, excluding (i) any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger and (ii) capital gains incentive fees (\"Part II incentive fees\"). \n  * **“Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes” and “Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes Per Share”** – represents net realized and unrealized gains (losses) net of taxes excluding any net realized and unrealized gains (losses) resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger.\n  * **“Adjusted Earnings (Loss)” and “Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share”** – represents the sum of (i) Adjusted Net Investment Income and (ii) Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes and includes the impact of Part II incentive fees1, if any.\n\n\n\nThe OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger (the \"Mergers\") were accounted for as asset acquisitions in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50,_Business Combinations—Related Issues_(\"ASC 805\"). The consideration paid to each of the stockholders of OCSI and OSI2 were allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired other than \"non-qualifying\" assets, which established a new cost basis for the acquired investments under ASC 805 that, in aggregate, was different than the historical cost basis of the acquired investments prior to the OCSI Merger or the OSI2 Merger, as applicable. Additionally, immediately following the completion of the Mergers, the acquired investments were marked to their respective fair values under ASC 820, _Fair Value Measurements_ , which resulted in unrealized appreciation/depreciation. The new cost basis established by ASC 805 on debt investments acquired will accrete/amortize over the life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation/depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The new cost basis established by ASC 805 on equity investments acquired will not accrete/amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized gain/loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation/depreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.\n\nThe Company’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measures described above internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and to compare its financial results with those of other business development companies that have not adjusted the cost basis of certain investments pursuant to ASC 805. The Company’s management believes \"Adjusted Total Investment Income\", \"Adjusted Total Investment Income Per Share\", \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" and \"Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share\" are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company without giving effect to the income resulting from the new cost basis of the investments acquired in the Mergers because these amounts do not impact the fees payable to Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\") under its investment advisory agreement (as amended and restated from time to time, the \"A&R Advisory Agreement\"), and specifically as its relates to \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" and \"Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share\", without giving effect to Part II incentive fees. In addition, the Company’s management believes that “Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes”, “Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes Per Share”, “Adjusted Earnings (Loss)” and “Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share” are useful to investors as they exclude the non-cash income and gain/loss resulting from the Mergers and are used by management to evaluate the economic earnings of its investment portfolio. Moreover, these metrics more closely align the Company's key financial measures with the calculation of incentive fees payable to the Adviser under with the A&R Advisory Agreement (i.e., excluding amounts resulting solely from the lower cost basis of the acquired investments established by ASC 805 that would have been to the benefit of the Adviser absent such exclusion).\n\n_____________________1 Adjusted earnings (loss) includes accrued Part II incentive fees. As of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was no accrued Part II incentive fee liability. Part II incentive fees are contractually calculated and paid at the end of the fiscal year in accordance with the A&R Advisory Agreement, which differs from Part II incentive fees accrued under GAAP. For the year ended September 30, 2024, no amounts were payable under the A&R Advisory Agreement.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total investment income (the most comparable U.S.

The increase was primarily driven by higher interest income as a result of the growth in the investment portfolio and higher original issue discount (“OID”) accretion driven by purchase premium acceleration in the prior quarter from the repayment of certain investments acquired in the mergers with Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation (“OCSI”) and Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. (“OSI2”). This was partially offset by the impact of certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status and a decrease in amendment fees. Adjusted total investment income was $95.6 million ($1.17 per share) for the third fiscal quarter, as compared with $97.3 million ($1.22 per share) for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by lower interest income due to the impact of certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status and lower OID acceleration from investment repayments as well as a decrease in amendment fees. This was partially offset by higher coupon interest income as a result of the growth in the investment portfolio.\n  * **GAAP net investment income** was $44.6 million ($0.54 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2024, as compared with $41.4 million ($0.52 per share) for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. The increase for the quarter was primarily driven by lower part I incentive fees (net of fees waived) and higher total investment income, partially offset by higher interest expense.\n  * **Adjusted net investment income** was $45.2 million ($0.55 per share) for the third fiscal quarter of 2024, as compared with $44.7 million ($0.56 per share) for the second fiscal quarter of 2024. The increase for the quarter was primarily driven by lower part I incentive fees (net of fees waived), partially offset by lower adjusted total investment income and higher interest expense. The per share decrease for the quarter was driven by an increase in weighted average shares outstanding.\n  * **Net asset value (\"NAV\") per share** was $18.19 as of June 30, 2024, down as compared with $18.72 as of March 31, 2024. The decline from March 31, 2024 primarily reflected unrealized losses on certain debt and equity investments.\n  * **Waived part I incentive fees** of $3.2 million in addition to the $1.5 million of management fees waived for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. \n  * **Originated** $338.7 million of new investment commitments and received $185.5 million of proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The weighted average yield on new debt investments was 11.1%.\n  * **Total debt outstanding** was $1,740.0 million as of June 30, 2024. The total debt to equity ratio was 1.16x, and the net debt to equity ratio was 1.10x, after adjusting for cash and cash equivalents.\n  * **Liquidity** as of June 30, 2024 was composed of $96.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $827.5 million of undrawn capacity under the Company's credit facilities (subject to borrowing base and other limitations). Unfunded investment commitments were $291.4 million, or $264.3 million excluding unfunded commitments to the Company's joint ventures. Of the $264.3 million, approximately $219.4 million can be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies or other restrictions.\n  * **A quarterly cash distribution was declared** of $0.55 per share. The distribution is payable in cash on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record on September 16, 2024.\n\n\n\nArmen Panossian, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer, said “Our fiscal third quarter results were supported by continued origination activity, which led to portfolio growth and increased coupon interest income. Our originations in the third quarter were $339 million of new investment commitments, while also realizing repayments and sales of $186 million.”\n\n“We remain focused on shifting our investment composition to first lien loans and on improving our portfolio quality and performance in this changing market environment. During the quarter, however, we experienced challenges at certain portfolio investments, resulting in a decline in NAV and an increase in non-accruals,” Panossian added. “We continue to leverage our expertise in navigating turnarounds with the goal of achieving favorable outcomes on these investments and generating value for our shareholders.”\n\n“In addition to the permanent management fee reduction that went into effect on July 1, 2024, we have announced an incentive fee waiver as part of our third quarter results, which demonstrates our commitment to shareholders. We remain confident in our strategy and the ability of our portfolio to deliver sustainable and attractive returns.”\n\n**Distribution Declaration**\n\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.55 per share. The distribution is payable in cash on September 30, 2024 to stockholders of record on September 16, 2024.\n\nDistributions are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company’s stockholders.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ | **June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \n**GAAP operating results:**  \nInterest income | $ | 85,953 | $ | 85,256 | $ | 95,310  \nPIK interest income | 6,149 | 4,816 | 3,967  \nFee income | 1,460 | 2,546 | 1,573  \nDividend income | 1,404 | 1,411 | 1,050  \n**Total investment income** | **94,966** | **94,029** | **101,900**  \nNet expenses | 50,391 | 52,662 | 53,487  \n**Net investment income** | **44,575** | **41,367** | **48,413**  \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes | (43,455 | ) | (32,030 | ) | (11,728 | )  \n**Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations** | **$** | **1,120** | **$** | **9,337** | **$** | **36,685**  \n**Total investment income per common share** | **$** | **1.16** | **$** | **1.18** | **$** | **1.32**  \n**Net investment income per common share** | **$** | **0.54** | **$** | **0.52** | **$** | **0.63**  \n**Net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes per common share** | **$** | **(0.53** | **)** | **$** | **(0.40** | **)** | **$** | **(0.15** | **)**  \n**Earnings (loss) per common share — basic and diluted** | **$** | **0.01** | **$** | **0.12** | **$** | **0.48**  \n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures****1****:**  \n**Adjusted total investment income** | **$** | **95,573** | **$** | **97,340** | **$** | **101,058**  \n**Adjusted net investment income** | **$** | **45,182** | **$** | **44,678** | **$** | **47,571**  \n**Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes** | **$** | **(44,055** | **)** | **$** | **(35,344** | **)** | **$** | **(11,116** | **)**  \n**Adjusted earnings (loss)** | **$** | **1,127** | **$** | **9,334** | **$** | **36,455**  \n**Adjusted total investment income per share** | **$** | **1.17** | **$** | **1.22** | **$** | **1.31**  \n**Adjusted net investment income per share** | **$** | **0.55** | **$** | **0.56** | **$** | **0.62**  \n**Adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes per share** | **$** | **(0.54** | **)** | **$** | **(0.44** | **)** | **$** | **(0.14** | **)**  \n**Adjusted earnings (loss) per share** | **$** | **0.01** | **$** | **0.12** | **$** | **0.47**  \n  \n______________________1 See _Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ below for a description of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliations from the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the Company's non-GAAP measures, including on a per share basis. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company and to review the Company’s performance without giving effect to non-cash income/gain/loss resulting from the merger of OCSI with and into the Company in March 2021 (the \"OCSI Merger\") and the merger of OSI2 with and into the Company in January 2023 (the \"OSI2 Merger\") and, in the case of adjusted net investment income, without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. The presentation of non-GAAP measures is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data and ratios)_ | **June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \n**Select balance sheet and other data:**  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 96,321 | $ | 125,031 | $ | 59,704  \nInvestment portfolio at fair value | 3,121,703 | 3,047,445 | 3,135,619  \nTotal debt outstanding (net of unamortized financing costs) | 1,697,164 | 1,635,642 | 1,740,066  \nNet assets | 1,496,133 | 1,524,099 | 1,509,441  \nNet asset value per share | 18.19 | 18.72 | 19.58  \nTotal debt to equity ratio | 1.16 | x | 1.10 | x | 1.18 | x  \nNet debt to equity ratio | 1.10 | x | 1.02 | x | 1.14 | x  \n  \nAdjusted total investment income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $95.6 million and included $86.6 million of interest income from portfolio investments, $6.1 million of payment-in-kind (\"PIK\") interest income, $1.5 million of fee income and $1.4 million of dividend income. The $1.8 million decline in adjusted total investment income was attributable to a $0.7 million decrease in interest income, which was attributable to certain investments that were placed on non-accrual status and lower OID acceleration from investment repayments and was partially offset by higher coupon interest income as a result of the growth in the investment portfolio. Also contributing to the decline was a $1.1 million decrease in fee income which was primarily due to lower amendment fees.\n\nNet expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 totaled $50.4 million, down $2.3 million from the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by $3.3 million lower part I incentive fees (net of fees waived) as a result of the Part I incentive fees waived by Oaktree during the quarter, partially offset by $0.6 million of higher interest expense from an increase in borrowings and $0.2 million of higher general and administrative expenses.\n\nAdjusted net investment income was $45.2 million ($0.55 per share) for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as compared to $44.7 million ($0.56 per share) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The increase of $0.5 million for the quarter reflected $2.3 million of lower net expenses, partially offset by $1.8 million of lower adjusted total investment income. The per share decrease for the quarter was driven by an increase in weighted average shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted net realized and unrealized losses, net of taxes, was $44.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, primarily reflecting realized and unrealized losses on certain debt and equity investments.\n\n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\n**As of**  \n---  \n_($ in thousands)_ | **June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \nInvestments at fair value | $ | 3,121,703 | $ | 3,047,445 | $ | 3,135,619  \nNumber of portfolio companies | 158 | 151 | 156  \nAverage portfolio company debt size | $ | 19,900 | $ | 20,100 | $ | 19,800  \n**Asset class:**  \nFirst lien debt | 82.5 | % | 80.8 | % | 76.5 | %  \nSecond lien debt | 3.5 | % | 5.4 | % | 12.0 | %  \nUnsecured debt | 3.8 | % | 2.6 | % | 1.7 | %  \nEquity | 4.2 | % | 4.8 | % | 3.8 | %  \nJV interests | 6.0 | % | 6.4 | % | 6.0 | %  \n**Non-accrual debt investments:**  \nNon-accrual investments at fair value | $ | 110,599 | $ | 69,128 | $ | 91,152  \nNon-accrual investments at cost | 172,827 | 127,720 | 111,732  \nNon-accrual investments as a percentage of debt investments at fair value | 3.7 | % | 2.4 | % | 3.1 | %  \nNon-accrual investments as a percentage of debt investments at cost | 5.7 | % | 4.3 | % | 3.6 | %  \nNumber of investments on non-accrual | 8 | 5 | 5  \n**Interest rate type:**  \nPercentage floating-rate | 85.3 | % | 85.4 | % | 86.0 | %  \nPercentage fixed-rate | 14.7 | % | 14.6 | % | 14.0 | %  \n**Yields:**  \nWeighted average yield on debt investments1 | 11.9 | % | 12.2 | % | 12.3 | %  \nCash component of weighted average yield on debt investments | 10.6 | % | 11.0 | % | 11.4 | %  \nWeighted average yield on total portfolio investments2 | 11.5 | % | 11.7 | % | 11.8 | %  \n**Investment activity:**  \nNew investment commitments | $ | 338,700 | $ | 395,600 | $ | 251,000  \nNew funded investment activity3 | $ | 293,200 | $ | 377,400 | $ | 243,300  \nProceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales | $ | 185,500 | $ | 322,600 | $ | 261,000  \nNet new investments4 | $ | 107,700 | $ | 54,800 | $ | (17,700 | )  \nNumber of new investment commitments in new portfolio companies | 11 | 20 | 6  \nNumber of new investment commitments in existing portfolio companies | 9 | 15 | 4  \nNumber of portfolio company exits | 3 | 15 | 16  \n  \n______________________1 Annual stated yield earned plus net annual amortization of OID or premium earned on accruing investments, including the Company's share of the return on debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, and excluding any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and OSI2 Merger.2 Annual stated yield earned plus net annual amortization of OID or premium earned on accruing investments and dividend income, including the Company's share of the return on debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, and excluding any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and OSI2 Merger.3 New funded investment activity includes drawdowns on existing revolver and delayed draw term loan commitments.4 Net new investments consists of new funded investment activity less proceeds from prepayments, exits, other paydowns and sales.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $3.1 billion and was composed of investments in 158 companies. These included debt investments in 141 companies, equity investments in 42 companies, and the Company's joint venture investments in SLF JV I and OCSI Glick JV LLC (\"Glick JV\"). 27 of the equity investments were in companies in which the Company also had a debt investment.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, 94.9% of the Company's portfolio at fair value consisted of debt investments, including 82.5% of first lien loans, 3.5% of second lien loans and 9.0% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV. This compared to 80.8% of first lien loans, 5.4% of second lien loans and 7.9% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I and Glick JV, as of March 31, 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, there were eight investments on non-accrual status, which represented 5.7% and 3.7% of the debt portfolio at cost and fair value, respectively. This is up from five investments on non-accrual status in the prior quarter, which represented 4.3% and 2.4% of the debt portfolio at cost and fair value, respectively.\n\n_SLF JV I_\n\nThe Company's investments in SLF JV I totaled $138.5 million at fair value as of June 30, 2024, down 2.7% from $142.3 million as of March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by SLF JV I’s use of leverage and unrealized depreciation in the underlying investment portfolio.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, SLF JV I had $390.8 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 49 portfolio companies. This compared to $398.7 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 54 portfolio companies, as of March 31, 2024. SLF JV I generated cash interest income of $3.5 million for the Company during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, consistent with the prior quarter. In addition, SLF JV I generated dividend income of $1.4 million for the Company during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, consistent with the prior quarter. As of June 30, 2024, SLF JV I had $72.0 million of undrawn capacity (subject to borrowing base and other limitations) on its $270 million senior revolving credit facility, and its debt to equity ratio was 1.3x.\n\n_Glick JV_\n\nThe Company's investments in Glick JV totaled $49.9 million at fair value as of June 30, 2024, down 2.8% from $51.3 million as of March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by SLF JV I’s use of leverage and unrealized depreciation in the underlying investment portfolio.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, Glick JV had $150.2 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 45 portfolio companies. This compared to $154.7 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 49 portfolio companies, as of March 31, 2024. Glick JV generated cash interest income of $1.5 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, consistent with the prior quarter. As of June 30, 2024, Glick JV had $22.0 million of undrawn capacity (subject to borrowing base and other limitations) on its $100 million senior revolving credit facility, and its debt to equity ratio was 1.5x.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had total principal value of debt outstanding of $1,740.0 million, including $790.0 million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, $300.0 million of the 3.500% Notes due 2025, $350.0 million of the 2.700% Notes due 2027 and $300.0 million of the 7.100% Notes due 2029. The funding mix was composed of 45% secured and 55% unsecured borrowings as of June 30, 2024. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under its credit facilities as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had $96.3 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $827.5 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities (subject to borrowing base and other limitations). As of June 30, 2024, unfunded investment commitments were $291.4 million, or $264.3 million excluding unfunded commitments to the Company's joint ventures. Of the $264.3 million, approximately $219.4 million could be drawn immediately with the remaining amount subject to certain milestones that must be met by portfolio companies or other restrictions. The Company has analyzed cash and cash equivalents, availability under its credit facilities, the ability to rotate out of certain assets and amounts of unfunded commitments that could be drawn and believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to invest in market opportunities as they arise.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding, including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements, was 7.0%, unchanged from March 31, 2024.\n\nThe Company’s total debt to equity ratio was 1.16x and 1.10x as of each of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The Company's net debt to equity ratio was 1.10x and 1.02x as of each of June 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nOn a supplemental basis, the Company is disclosing certain adjusted financial measures, each of which is calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP”). The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company and to review the Company’s performance without giving effect to non-cash income/gain/loss resulting from the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger and in the case of adjusted net investment income, without giving effect to capital gains incentive fees. The presentation of the below non-GAAP measures is not intended to be a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered in isolation.\n\n  * **\"Adjusted Total Investment Income\" and \"Adjusted Total Investment Income Per Share\"** – represents total investment income excluding any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger.\n  * **“Adjusted Net Investment Income” and “Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share”** – represents net investment income, excluding (i) any amortization or accretion of interest income resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger and (ii) capital gains incentive fees (\"Part II incentive fees\"). \n  * **“Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes” and “Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes Per Share”** – represents net realized and unrealized gains (losses) net of taxes excluding any net realized and unrealized gains (losses) resulting solely from the cost basis established by ASC 805 (see below) for the assets acquired in connection with the OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger.\n  * **“Adjusted Earnings (Loss)” and “Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share”** – represents the sum of (i) Adjusted Net Investment Income and (ii) Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes and includes the impact of Part II incentive fees1, if any.\n\n\n\nThe OCSI Merger and the OSI2 Merger (the \"Mergers\") were accounted for as asset acquisitions in accordance with the asset acquisition method of accounting as detailed in ASC 805-50,_Business Combinations—Related Issues_(\"ASC 805\"). The consideration paid to each of the stockholders of OCSI and OSI2 were allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired other than \"non-qualifying\" assets, which established a new cost basis for the acquired investments under ASC 805 that, in aggregate, was different than the historical cost basis of the acquired investments prior to the OCSI Merger or the OSI2 Merger, as applicable. Additionally, immediately following the completion of the Mergers, the acquired investments were marked to their respective fair values under ASC 820, _Fair Value Measurements_ , which resulted in unrealized appreciation/depreciation. The new cost basis established by ASC 805 on debt investments acquired will accrete/amortize over the life of each respective debt investment through interest income, with a corresponding adjustment recorded to unrealized appreciation/depreciation on such investment acquired through its ultimate disposition. The new cost basis established by ASC 805 on equity investments acquired will not accrete/amortize over the life of such investments through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity investments acquired and disposition of such equity investments at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized gain/loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized appreciation/depreciation on disposition of such equity investments acquired.\n\nThe Company’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measures described above internally to analyze and evaluate financial results and performance and to compare its financial results with those of other business development companies that have not adjusted the cost basis of certain investments pursuant to ASC 805. The Company’s management believes \"Adjusted Total Investment Income\", \"Adjusted Total Investment Income Per Share\", \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" and \"Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share\" are useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing results and trends for the Company without giving effect to the income resulting from the new cost basis of the investments acquired in the Mergers because these amounts do not impact the fees payable to Oaktree Fund Advisors, LLC (the \"Adviser\") under its second amended and restated advisory agreement (the \"A&R Advisory Agreement\"), and specifically as its relates to \"Adjusted Net Investment Income\" and \"Adjusted Net Investment Income Per Share\", without giving effect to Part II incentive fees. In addition, the Company’s management believes that “Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes”, “Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses), Net of Taxes Per Share”, “Adjusted Earnings (Loss)” and “Adjusted Earnings (Loss) Per Share” are useful to investors as they exclude the non-cash income and gain/loss resulting from the Mergers and are used by management to evaluate the economic earnings of its investment portfolio. Moreover, these metrics more closely align the Company's key financial measures with the calculation of incentive fees payable to the Adviser under with the A&R Advisory Agreement (i.e., excluding amounts resulting solely from the lower cost basis of the acquired investments established by ASC 805 that would have been to the benefit of the Adviser absent such exclusion).\n\n________________________1 Adjusted earnings (loss) includes accrued Part II incentive fees. As of and for the three months ended June 30, 2024, there was no accrued Part II incentive fee liability. Part II incentive fees are contractually calculated and paid at the end of the fiscal year in accordance with the A&R Advisory Agreement, which differs from Part II incentive fees accrued under GAAP. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, no amounts were payable under the A&R Advisory Agreement.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total investment income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to adjusted total investment income for the periods presented:\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share**  \nGAAP total investment income | $ | 94,966 | $ | 1.16 | $ | 94,029 | $ | 1.18 | $ | 101,900 | $ | 1.32  \nInterest income amortization (accretion) related to merger accounting adjustments | 607 | 0.01 | 3,311 | 0.04 | (842 | ) | (0.01 | )  \nAdjusted total investment income | $ | 95,573 | $ | 1.17 | $ | 97,340 | $ | 1.22 | $ | 101,058 | $ | 1.31  \n  \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to adjusted net investment income for the periods presented:\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share**  \nGAAP net investment income | $ | 44,575 | $ | 0.54 | $ | 41,367 | $ | 0.52 | $ | 48,413 | $ | 0.63  \nInterest income amortization (accretion) related to merger accounting adjustments | 607 | 0.01 | 3,311 | 0.04 | (842 | ) | (0.01 | )  \nPart II incentive fee | — | — | — | — | — | —  \nAdjusted net investment income | $ | 45,182 | $ | 0.55 | $ | 44,678 | $ | 0.56 | $ | 47,571 | $ | 0.62  \n  \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to adjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes for the periods presented:\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share**  \nGAAP net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes | $ | (43,455 | ) | $ | (0.53 | ) | $ | (32,030 | ) | $ | (0.40 | ) | $ | (11,728 | ) | $ | (0.15 | )  \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to merger accounting adjustments | (600 | ) | (0.01 | ) | (3,314 | ) | (0.04 | ) | 612 | 0.01  \nAdjusted net realized and unrealized gains (losses), net of taxes | $ | (44,055 | ) | $ | (0.54 | ) | $ | (35,344 | ) | $ | (0.44 | ) | $ | (11,116 | ) | $ | (0.14 | )  \n  \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) to adjusted earnings (loss) for the periods presented:\n\n**For the three months ended**  \n---  \n**June 30, 2024(unaudited)** | **March 31, 2024(unaudited)** | **June 30, 2023(unaudited)**  \n_($ in thousands, except per share data)_ | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share** | **Amount** | **Per Share**  \nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations | $ | 1,120 | $ | 0.01 | $ | 9,337 | $ | 0.12 | $ | 36,685 | $ | 0.48  \nInterest income amortization (accretion) related to merger accounting adjustments | 607 | 0.01 | 3,311 | 0.04 | (842 | ) | (0.01 | )  \nNet realized and unrealized gains (losses) related to merger accounting adjustments | (600 | ) | (0.01 | ) | (3,314 | ) | (0.04 | ) | 612 | 0.01  \nAdjusted earnings (loss) | $ | 1,127 | $ | 0.01 | $ | 9,334 | $ | 0.12 | $ | 36,455 | $ | 0.47  \n  \n**Conference Call Information**\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending will host a conference call to discuss its third fiscal quarter 2024 results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time on August 1, 2024.

Effective July 1, 2024, the base management fee will be reduced to an annual rate of 1.00% from 1.50% on gross assets, including any investments made with borrowings, but excluding any cash and cash equivalents. The new base management fee will be calculated net of the base management fees that Oaktree Fund Advisers, LLC (“Oaktree”), OCSL’s investment adviser, waived as part of the merger of Oaktree Strategic Income II, Inc. into the Company (the “OSI2 Merger”), which expire on January 23, 2025.\n\nThe new base management fee is expected to increase OCSL’s net investment income per share by approximately $0.15 annually. This equates to an estimated 0.8% improvement in the Company’s return on adjusted net investment income, representing a 7% increase from current levels.\n\nArmen Panossian, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of OCSL, said, “We believe this permanent change to our fee structure demonstrates Oaktree’s strong commitment to aligning its interests with shareholders. We have successfully grown OCSL since taking over as its investment adviser and this reduction in fees means that a larger portion of our investment income will flow to our shareholders. Today’s announcement significantly enhances our earnings power and reinforces our dedication to maximizing shareholder value over the long term.”\n\nIn addition, Oaktree waived additional base management fees such that the total amount of waived base management fees (including those previously waived) will be $1.5 million for each of the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024.\n\n**About Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation**\n\nOaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (NASDAQ:OCSL) is a specialty finance company dedicated to providing customized one-stop credit solutions to companies with limited access to public or syndicated capital markets.
