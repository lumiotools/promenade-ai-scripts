In addition, at the annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), we presented new clinical data on our Nodify XL2® and Nodify CDT® tests, and announced a new clinical study (CLARIFY) to expand our data in diverse patient populations tested in a real-world clinical setting. Building on this momentum, we are reiterating our prior guidance of $70-$72 million for 2024 and we look forward to achieving Adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second half of 2025. At Biodesix, our tests play a vital role in treating the deadliest of all cancers. Our committed and driven team embraces the opportunity, and the responsibility, to transform the standard of care to improve outcomes for patients.”\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Business Highlights**\n\n  * Grew Lung Diagnostic test volume to 13,900, a 34% improvement over the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Quarterly gross profit margin of 77.0% versus 76.1% for the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Presented compelling new data at the CHEST Annual Meeting and announced the launch of a new clinical study, CLARIFY. \n    * New data was presented detailing the experience of healthcare providers using the Nodify Lung® Nodule Risk Assessment Tests (Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT tests) in over 35,000 patients tested in a real-world clinical setting. Results shared were consistent with prior studies, highlighting the high proportion of results that up- or down-classify patients into actionable risk categories with clear, guideline-recommended, diagnostic plans.\n    * The new study, CLARIFY, is designed to confirm performance of the Nodify CDT and Nodify XL2 tests in diverse patient subgroups through a retrospective chart review of up to 4,000 patients that were tested in a real-world clinical setting. The study’s intent is to expand the extensive evidence characterizing the validation and utility of Nodify Lung testing.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * Total revenue of $18.2 million, an increase of 35% over the third quarter 2023: \n    * **_Lung Diagnostic_** _revenue of $17.2 million reflected a year-over-year increase of 40% driven by the continued adoption of Nodify XL2 and Nodify CDT nodule risk assessment tests and strong reimbursement. However, test volumes were impacted at the end of the third quarter by disruption to patients, healthcare providers, and Biodesix teammates in the southeast due to Hurricane Helene;_\n    * **_Biopharmaceutical Services_** _revenue of $1.0 million decreased 17% year-over-year, driven by the timing of receipt of samples and shift of the completion of certain projects from the end of the third quarter into the beginning of the fourth;_\n  * Third quarter 2024 gross profit of $14.0 million, or 77.0% gross margin compared to 76.1% gross margin in the comparable prior year period. Our steady margin performance is primarily driven by volume growth in Lung Diagnostic testing that continues to drive down the per test costs;\n  * Operating expenses (excluding direct costs and expenses) of $22.6 million, an increase of 29% as compared to the third quarter 2023, which includes $3.0 million of non-cash stock compensation expense and depreciation and amortization as compared to $1.7 million in third quarter of 2023. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in sales and marketing costs to support both business lines’ sales growth to enhance product awareness and drive adoption, and an increase in depreciation expense related to the leasehold improvements in the Company’s Louisville, CO offices and laboratory which opened in January 2024;\n  * Net loss of $10.3 million, an improvement of 6% as compared to the same period of 2023;\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $5.6 million, a slight increase over the loss of $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2023 and consistent with the second quarter of 2024;\n  * Cash and cash equivalents of $31.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease from $42.2 million from June 30, 2024; \n    * _Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 includes the final milestone payment of $6.1 million for the acquisition of Integrated Diagnostics in 2018._\n\n\n\n**2024 - 2025 Financial Outlook**\n\nThe Company is reiterating the 2024 revenue forecast of between $70 million and $72 million.\n\n**Conference call and webcast information**\n\nListeners can register for the webcast via this [_link_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=bULWgj721yo6N9PP02-dGbJ9_hmv1ii9f6t3qAgliKvIBwg3zprASooMoG7Nufc4OonCh-bMn2E7dh5-4lbLlBEzj--Tg0NAqNcEFQp4f0s=).

The ddPCR technology is a trademark of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measure**\n\nBiodesix reported results are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Biodesix has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Biodesix uses the non-GAAP financial measure, **_Adjusted EBITDA_** , internally in analyzing its financial results and believes that use of this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as an additional tool to evaluate ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing Biodesix financial results with other companies in its industry, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with Biodesix financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Biodesix historical non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release, and investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that our management uses to assess our financial performance and is also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and other interested parties in analyzing our financial performance because it provides a comparable overview of our operations across historical periods. In addition, we believe that providing Adjusted EBITDA, together with a reconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, helps investors make comparisons between our Company and other companies that may have different capital structures, different tax rates, and/or different forms of employee compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is used by our management team as an additional measure of our performance for purposes of business decision-making, including managing expenditures. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA help our management identify additional trends in our financial results that may not be shown solely by period- to-period comparisons of Net loss or Loss from operations. Our management recognizes that Adjusted EBITDA has inherent limitations because of the excluded items and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.\n\nWe calculate Adjusted EBITDA as Net loss adjusted to exclude interest, income tax expense, if any, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, loss on debt extinguishments, net, COVID-19 revenue, COVID-19 direct costs and expenses, change in fair value of warrant liabilities, net, other income, net, and other non-recurring items. Non-recurring items are excluded as they are not representative of our underlying operating performance. We also exclude revenue and direct costs and expenses associated with COVID-19 because we believe that these revenues and expenses do not reflect expected future operating results as they do not represent our Lung Diagnostic and Biopharmaceutical Services business. Adjusted EBITDA should be viewed as a measure of operating performance that is a supplement to, and not a substitute for Loss from operations, Net loss, and other GAAP measures.\n\n**Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
