Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results and Declares $0.10 Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nOctober 23, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/7886/pdf)\n\n**Third Quarter Performance Highlights**\n\n  * **Net Income:** Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 totaled $3.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares).

Momentum continues to build with current deposits of $105 million and deposit and C&I loan pipelines related to this office of $43 million and $104 million, respectively.\n    * **Residential Lending:** The Bank continues to originate loans for its portfolio while developing the flow origination program launched in late 2023. Of the $27.3 million in closed loans originated in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, $7.4 million were originated for the Bank’s portfolio and reflected a weighted average yield of 7.59% before origination and other fees, which average 50-100 bps per loan, and a weighted average LTV of 61%.\n  * **Tangible Book Value Per Share:** Tangible book value per share (including Series A preferred shares) was $23.28 at September 30, 2024 compared to $22.51 at December 31, 2023. \n  * **Quarterly Cash Dividend:** The Company’s Board of Directors approved a $0.10 per share cash dividend on both common and Series A preferred shares payable on November 13, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 6, 2024.\n  * **Port Jefferson Branch**: The Company has received regulatory approval for the opening of a full-service branch in Port Jefferson, New York. Business development staff have already joined the Company in anticipation of the opening of this location. The Bank expects this site to be fully operational in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\nMINEOLA, N.Y., Oct. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hanover Bancorp, Inc. (“Hanover” or “the Company” – NASDAQ: HNVR), the holding company for Hanover Community Bank (“the Bank”), today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and the declaration of a $0.10 per share cash dividend on both common and Series A preferred shares payable on November 13, 2024 to stockholders of record on November 6, 2024.\n\n**Earnings Summary for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nThe Company reported net income for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of $3.5 million or $0.48 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares). The Company recorded adjusted (non-GAAP) net income (excluding severance and retirement expenses) of $3.7 million or $0.50 per diluted share in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, versus adjusted (non-GAAP) net income (excluding a litigation settlement payment) of $2.8 million or $0.38 per diluted share in the comparable 2023 quarter. Returns on average assets, average stockholders’ equity and average tangible equity were 0.62%, 7.35% and 8.19%, respectively, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, versus 0.66%, 7.58% and 8.47%, respectively, for the comparable quarter of 2023. Adjusted (non-GAAP) returns, exclusive of severance and retirement expenses on average assets, average stockholders’ equity and average tangible equity were 0.65%, 7.69% and 8.56%, respectively, in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, versus 0.53%, 6.00% and 6.71%, respectively, in the comparable 2023 quarter, exclusive of a litigation settlement payment.\n\nWhile net interest income and non-interest income increased during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the September 30, 2023 quarter, this was offset by an increase in non-interest expenses, particularly compensation and benefits, resulting in flat earnings between these periods. The increase in non-interest income is primarily related to the increase in the gain on sale of loans held-for-sale which was partially offset by a decrease in other operating income. In the September 30, 2023 quarter, the Company settled ongoing litigation and received a settlement payment of $975 thousand which was recorded in other operating income. Included in compensation and benefits expense in the third quarter of 2024 was expense related to additional staff for the SBA, C&I Banking and Operations teams and severance payments in August 2024 paid in connection with a loan personnel restructuring initiative. These expenses were offset by lower incentive compensation expense resulting from reduced projected lending activity and lower deferred loan origination costs.\n\nNet interest income was $13.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $1.3 million, or 11.04%, versus the comparable 2023 quarter due to improvement of the Company’s net interest margin to 2.37% in the 2024 quarter from 2.29% in the comparable 2023 quarter. The yield on interest earning assets increased to 6.17% in the 2024 quarter from 5.61% in the comparable 2023 quarter, an increase of 56 basis points that was partially offset by a 58 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.53% in 2024 from 3.95% in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Earnings Summary for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $8.4 million or $1.14 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares), versus $9.8 million or $1.33 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares) in the comparable 2023 nine-month period. The Company recorded adjusted (non-GAAP) net income (excluding severance and retirement expenses) of $8.6 million or $1.16 per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, versus adjusted (non-GAAP) net income (excluding severance and retirement expenses and a litigation settlement payment) of $9.4 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the comparable 2023 nine-month period.\n\nThe decrease in net income recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the comparable 2023 period resulted from an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in non-interest expense, which were partially offset by an increase in non-interest income, consisting primarily of gain on sale of loans held-for-sale. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributed to additional staff for the SBA, C&I Banking and Operations teams. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 24.50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 26.03% in the comparable 2023 period.\n\nNet interest income was $39.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a slight increase of $0.1 million, or 0.14% from the comparable 2023 period. The Company’s net interest margin was 2.41% in the 2024 period and 2.65% in the comparable 2023 period. The yield on interest earning assets increased to 6.14% in the 2024 period from 5.58% in the comparable 2023 period, an increase of 56 basis points that was offset by a 95 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.45% in 2024 from 3.50% in the comparable 2023 period due to the rapid and significant rise in interest rates.\n\nMichael P. Puorro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the Company’s quarterly results: “We are pleased with third-quarter results, which reflect the benefits of our diversified revenue streams. Strategic expansion of our C&I banking and government guaranteed lending initiatives continue to deliver sustained results. The success of our Hauppauge Business Banking Center over the last 16 months has yielded exceptional results as evidenced by over $100 million in deposits. Our investment in diversifying our residential lending activities from portfolio originations to including flow originations is gaining momentum. The continued decline in interest rates forecast by many economists is expected to provide sustained net interest margin expansion over the near term, having an anticipated positive impact on earnings. We believe these factors, coupled with our commitment to efficiency across our organization, position us for continued growth and opportunity, particularly in a market with continued consolidation. We continue to strategically seek opportunities to recruit talent and expand our footprint in the underserved Long Island community and wider New York City markets.”\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nTotal assets at September 30, 2024 were $2.33 billion versus $2.27 billion at December 31, 2023. Total securities available for sale at September 30, 2024 were $98.4 million, an increase of $36.9 million from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by growth in U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\n\nTotal deposits at September 30, 2024 were $1.96 billion, an increase of $52.9 million or 2.78%, compared to $1.90 billion at December 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 102% at September 30, 2024 and 103% at December 31, 2023.\n\nAlthough core deposits, comprised of Demand, NOW, Savings and Money Market, grew to $1.45 billion as of September 30, 2024 from $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2023, Demand deposit balances decreased from $207.8 million to $206.3 million during the same period. This decrease was confined to deposits made by residential loan borrowers in anticipation of residential loan closings. These funds comprise the equity residential borrowers are required to contribute to residential loan closings. The volume of these deposits rise and fall in proportion to the volume of anticipated residential loan closings. As the pace of residential lending increases, the volume of Demand deposits will increase accordingly. Demand deposits, net of balances related to residential loan closings, grew to $181.8 million as of September 30, 2024 from $166.4 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 9.28%, underscoring the continued success of our C&I Banking vertical.\n\nThe Company had $366.2 million in total municipal deposits at September 30, 2024, at a weighted average rate of 4.24% versus $528.1 million at a weighted average rate of 4.62% at December 31, 2023. The Company’s municipal deposit program is built on long-standing relationships developed in the local marketplace. This core deposit business will continue to provide a stable source of funding for the Company’s lending products at costs lower than those of consumer deposits and market-based borrowings. The Company continues to broaden its municipal deposit base and currently services 39 customer relationships.\n\nTotal borrowings at September 30, 2024 were $125.8 million, with a weighted average rate and term of 4.25% and 22 months, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $107.8 million and $126.7 million, respectively, of term FHLB advances outstanding. The Company had $18.0 million of FHLB overnight borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 and none at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company’s borrowings from the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (“PPPLF”) were $0 and $2.3 million, respectively. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under lines of credit with correspondent banks at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk, including interest rate swap agreements which currently provide a benefit to net interest income.\n\nStockholders’ equity was $192.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $184.8 million at December 31, 2023. The $7.5 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $6.2 million in retained earnings and a decrease of $0.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in retained earnings was due primarily to net income of $8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was offset by $2.2 million of dividends declared. The accumulated other comprehensive loss at September 30, 2024 was 1.10% of total equity and was comprised of a $1.0 million after tax net unrealized loss on the investment portfolio and a $1.1 million after tax net unrealized loss on derivatives.\n\n**Loan Portfolio**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank’s loan portfolio grew to $2.01 billion, for an increase of $48.6 million or 3.31% annualized. Growth was concentrated primarily in residential, SBA and C&I loans. At September 30, 2024, the Company’s residential loan portfolio (including home equity) amounted to $745.9 million, with an average loan balance of $483 thousand and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57%. Commercial real estate and multifamily loans totaled $1.09 billion at September 30, 2024, with an average loan balance of $1.5 million and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 59%. As will be discussed below, only approximately 37% of the multifamily portfolio is subject to rent regulation. The Company’s commercial real estate concentration ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 397% of capital at September 30, 2024 from 432% of capital at December 31, 2023, with loans secured by office space accounting for 2.27% of the total loan portfolio and totaling $45.5 million. The Company’s loan pipeline with executed term sheets at September 30, 2024 is approximately $142 million, with approximately 97% being niche-residential, conventional C&I and SBA and USDA lending opportunities. \n\nHistorically, the Bank generated additional income by strategically originating and selling residential and government guaranteed loans to other financial institutions at premiums, while also retaining servicing rights in some sales. However, with the rapid increases in interest rates in recent years, the appetite among the Bank’s purchasers of residential loans for acquiring pools of loans declined, eliminating the Bank’s ability to sell residential loans in its portfolio on desirable terms. Commencing in late 2023, the Bank initiated development of a flow origination program under which the Bank originates individual loans for sale to specific buyers, thereby positioning the Bank to resume residential loan sales and generate fee income to complement sale premiums earned from the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA loans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold $16.5 million of residential loans under this program and recorded gains on sale of loans held-for-sale of $0.4 million. We expect the volume of activity to increase as the year progresses and our flow pipeline continues to build. Because we continue to prioritize the management of liquidity and capital, new business development is largely focused on flow originations over portfolio growth.\n\nThe Bank’s investment in government guaranteed lending continues to yield results. During the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold approximately $27.1 million and $18.4 million, respectively, in the government guaranteed portion of SBA loans and recorded gains on sale of loans held-for-sale of $2.4 million and $1.5 million, respectively.\n\n**Commercial Real Estate Statistics**\n\nA significant portion of the Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans secured by Multi-Family and CRE-Investor owned real estate that are predominantly subject to fixed interest rates for an initial period of 5 years. The Bank’s exposure to Land/Construction loans is minor at $9.5 million, all at floating interest rates, and CRE-owner occupied loans have a sizable mix of floating rates. As shown below, these two portfolios have only 11% combined of loans maturing through the balance of 2024 and 2025, with 55% maturing in 2027 alone.\n\n**Multi-Family Market Rent Portfolio Fixed Rate Reset/Maturity Schedule** | **Multi-Family Stabilized Rent Portfolio Fixed Rate Reset/Maturity Schedule**  \n---|---  \nCalendar Period(loan data as of9/30/24) | #Loans | Total O/S($000'somitted) | Avg O/S($000'somitted) | Avg InterestRate | Calendar Period(loan data as of9/30/24) | #Loans | Total O/S($000'somitted) | Avg O/S($000'somitted) | Avg InterestRate  \n2024 | 3 | $ | 1,861 | $ | 620 | 7.07 | % | 2024 | 4 | $ | 4,014 | $ | 1,004 | 5.43 | %  \n2025 | 9 | 15,977 | 1,775 | 4.16 | % | 2025 | 14 | 19,438 | 1,388 | 4.57 | %  \n2026 | 36 | 119,170 | 3,310 | 3.66 | % | 2026 | 20 | 43,147 | 2,157 | 3.67 | %  \n2027 | 72 | 178,368 | 2,477 | 4.31 | % | 2027 | 53 | 125,417 | 2,366 | 4.22 | %  \n2028 | 18 | 29,980 | 1,666 | 6.16 | % | 2028 | 11 | 9,966 | 906 | 7.12 | %  \n2029+ | 8 | 5,647 | 706 | 7.32 | % | 2029+ | 5 | 2,326 | 465 | 6.40 | %  \n**Fixed Rate** | **146** | **351,003** | **2,404** | **4.30** | **%** | **Fixed Rate** | **107** | **204,308** | **1,909** | **4.33** | **%**  \n**Floating Rate** | **3** | **457** | **152** | **9.56** | **%** | **Floating Rate** | **1** | **1,804** | **1,804** | **6.25** | **%**  \n**Total** | **149** | **$** | **351,460** | **$** | **2,359** | **4.32** | **%** | **Total** | **108** | **$** | **206,112** | **$** | **1,908** | **4.34** | **%**  \n  \n**CRE Investor Portfolio Fixed Rate Reset/Maturity Schedule**  \n---  \nCalendar Period(loan data as of9/30/24) | #Loans | Total O/S($000's omitted) | Avg O/S($000's omitted) | Avg InterestRate  \n2024 | 18 | $ | 30,965 | $ | 1,720 | 5.56 | %  \n2025 | 27 | 18,259 | 676 | 5.11 | %  \n2026 | 33 | 45,806 | 1,388 | 4.85 | %  \n2027 | 87 | 149,261 | 1,716 | 4.75 | %  \n2028 | 32 | 32,826 | 1,026 | 6.65 | %  \n2029+ | 16 | 6,519 | 407 | 6.15 | %  \n**Fixed Rate** | **213** | **283,636** | **1,332** | **5.13** | **%**  \n**Floating Rate** | **3** | **12,368** | **4,123** | **8.80** | **%**  \n**Total CRE-Inv.** | **216** | **$** | **296,004** | **$** | **1,370** | **5.28** | **%**  \n  \n**Rental breakdown of Multi-Family portfolio**\n\nThe table below segments our portfolio of loans secured by Multi-Family properties based on rental terms and location.

The portfolio has no delinquencies, defaults or modifications.\n\n**Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses**\n\nThe Bank’s asset quality ratios remain solid. At September 30, 2024, the Company reported $15.5 million in non-performing loans which represented 0.77% of total loans outstanding. Non-performing loans were $14.5 million at December 31, 2023 and $15.8 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded a provision for credit losses expense of $0.2 million. The September 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses balance was $23.4 million versus $19.7 million at December 31, 2023 and $23.6 million at June 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans was 1.17% at September 30 and June 30, 2024, inclusive of a $2.5 million allowance on an individually analyzed loan, versus 1.00% at December 31, 2023, which does not include the aforementioned $2.5 million allowance. \n\n**Net Interest Margin**\n\nThe Bank’s net interest margin increased to 2.37% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 2.29% in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The increase from the prior year quarter was primarily related to the increase in the average yield on loans, partially offset by the increase in the average total cost of funds. The Bank’s net interest margin was 2.46% in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, inclusive of $321 thousand or 6 bps related to an interest recovery on the sale of a non-performing loan. There were no such recoveries in the current quarter. Further, contributing to the decrease from the prior linked quarter was an increase in the total cost of interest-bearing deposits primarily related to the delayed timing of the Fed rate cut and our decision to ensure deposit retention via shorter duration products. Despite the linked quarter margin compression, we believe the Company is well positioned for the current or more favorable interest rate environments.\n\n**About Hanover Community Bank and Hanover Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nHanover Bancorp, Inc.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are required to be disclosed in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company’s management believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides both management and investors with a greater understanding of the Company’s operating results and trends in addition to the results measured in accordance with GAAP, and provides greater comparability across time periods. While management uses non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance, this information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the numbers prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP or considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other financial institutions.\n\nWith respect to the calculations of and reconciliations of adjusted net income, TCE, tangible assets, TCE ratio and tangible book value per share, reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures are provided in the tables that follow.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis release may contain certain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and may be identified by the use of such words as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"should,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"continue,\" and \"potential\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.

Puorro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hanover Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq: HNVR), the bank holding company for Hanover Community Bank, announced they hosted a cocktail party at their Hauppauge Business Banking center on Thursday, September 19, 2024 to thank the many people and businesses who have contributed to their success and welcomed them to Suffolk County.\n\nHanover Bank recognizes that success is never accomplished alone. Since its expansion into Suffolk County, Hanover has received an enormous amount of support from its clients, the community, the businesses, and the leaders of this region. The scores of people and businesses that rolled out the red carpet for Hanover are all a part of the fabric and foundation that makes Suffolk County one of New York’s most vibrant business hubs. With a philosophy that success comes through helping others succeed, Hanover wishes to recognize all this support by showing its appreciation and celebrating so many friends and associates.\n\nMichael Puorro stated, “Being a part of the Long Island Innovation Park at Hauppauge was the perfect choice for us when we decided to expand into Suffolk County. We have experienced such a tremendous amount of goodwill and enthusiasm that hosting this celebration is our way of thanking and honoring the many people who help us grow and succeed every day. This entire evening is dedicated to showing our appreciation and gratitude for the overwhelming warmth and welcome we have received.”\n\nThe Hanover Bank building was developed and built as a state-of-the-art office facility and is located at 410 Motor Parkway, Hauppauge, NY. The developer and owner of this property, Craig Padover, President of Aresco 410 LLC, worked closely with Kelly Murphy, Executive Director and CEO, Suffolk County Industrial Development Association (IDA) to take this vacant lot and transform it into a Class-A office building.\n\n“Much like the theme behind this celebration, the development of this beautiful, thoughtful building is the true definition of collaboration and partnership,” said Suffolk County Industrial Development Agency CEO/Executive Director Kelly Murphy. “This newest addition serves as the official gateway into the Long Island Innovation Park at Hauppauge and represents endless opportunity for those who walk through its doors. Long Islanders pride themselves on their quality of life and Hanover Bank’s building mirrored that sentiment with their employee-focused design and amenities. We congratulate Hanover Bank for anchoring this property now and into the future as we wish them continued success in the years to come,” stated Ms. Murphy.\n\n“In a project spearheaded and implemented by the Smithtown Supervisor Ed Wehrheim, our building was one of the first in the Innovation Park at Hauppauge to fully understand and take advantage of the Town of Smithtown overlay zone change along with the Suffolk County sewer expansion allowing the building to rise over sixty feet. Further, we are thrilled that Hanover Bank is a part of 410 Motor Parkway’s success,” stated Craig Padover.\n\nHanover Bank is so proud to contribute to the local and regional economy by employing approximately sixty-five people that operate from this business center. Logistically, this location allows us to further service the Long Island community with commercial, municipal, and consumer retail banking products. By contributing to the local economy, and by working and transacting business with many of Long Island’s most successful organizations and municipalities, our Hauppauge Business Banking Center allows us to leverage our existing relationships across business lines to deliver unparalleled service to this region.\n\n“There is much to celebrate and so many individuals to thank. We felt it was only fitting to recognize “the village” of people who have supported our growth, and last night was our way of showing our gratitude and letting them know how important they all are to us,” concluded Michael Puorro.\n\n**About Hanover Community Bank and Hanover Bancorp, Inc. **\n\nHanover Bancorp, Inc.

Reports Earnings for the Second Quarter and Declares $0.10 Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nJuly 24, 2024 \n\n[PDF Version](/node/7811/pdf)\n\n**Second Quarter Performance Highlights**\n\n  * **Net Income:** Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 totaled $0.8 million (after giving effect to an allowance for credit loss (“ACL”) on an individually evaluated loan of $2.5 million and a $1.1 million provision resulting from ongoing enhancements to the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model) or $0.11 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares), versus $4.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares) in the prior linked quarter and $3.1 million or $0.42 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares) in the comparable 2023 quarter.\n  * **Net Interest Income:** Net interest income was $13.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $0.3 million, or 2.4% from the prior linked quarter and a decrease of $0.3 million, or 1.9% from the June 30, 2023 quarter.\n  * **Net Interest Margin:** The Company’s net interest margin during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 increased to 2.46% from 2.41% in the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n  * **Strong Non-interest Income:** The Company’s non-interest income increased $0.1 million or 1.3% from the quarter ended March 31, 2024 and $1.6 million or 83.5% from the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This quarter’s non-interest income was a record for the Company when considering continuing revenues. Although non-interest income was higher for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, those results included income from a litigation settlement.\n  * **Strong Liquidity Position:** At June 30, 2024, undrawn liquidity sources, which include cash and unencumbered securities and secured and unsecured funding capacity, totaled $648.2 million or approximately 254% of uninsured deposit balances.\n  * **Deposit Activity:** Core deposits, consisting of Demand, NOW, Savings and Money Market, increased $95.4 million or 6.9% from December 31, 2023 and $24.8 million or 1.7% from March 31, 2024. Total deposits increased $37.3 million or 2.0% from December 31, 2023 and $24.7 million or 1.3% from March 31, 2024. Insured and collateralized deposits, which include municipal deposits, accounted for approximately 87% of total deposits at June 30, 2024.\n  * **Loan Growth:** Loans totaled $2.01 billion, a net increase of $7.4 million, or 1.5% annualized, from March 31, 2024, and $55.8 million or 5.7%, annualized from December 31, 2023. The Company’s commercial real estate concentration ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 403% of capital at June 30, 2024 from 432% of capital at December 31, 2023. Current and future loan growth will primarily be in residential loan products originated for sale to specific buyers in the secondary market, C&I and SBA loans, which strategically enhances our management of liquidity and capital while producing additional non-interest income.\n  * **Asset Quality:** At June 30, 2024, the Bank’s asset quality remained solid with non-performing loans totaling $15.8 million, representing 0.79% of the total loan portfolio, and the allowance for credit losses equaling 1.17% of total loans. Loans secured by office space accounted for approximately 2.3% of the total loan portfolio with a total balance of $46.2 million, of which less than 1% is located in Manhattan. During July, non-performing loans decreased $1.2 million to $14.6 million as a result of the full payoff of a residential investor loan.\n  * **Banking Initiatives:** At June 30, 2024, the Company’s banking initiatives reflected continuing momentum: \n    * **SBA & USDA Banking:** Gains on sale of SBA loans totaled $2.5 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, representing a 139% increase over the comparable 2023 quarter. Total SBA loans sold were $28.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, representing a 122% increase over the comparable 2023 quarter. Premiums earned on the sale of SBA loans continued to increase during the current quarter to 9.80% from 9.56% in the linked quarter and 8.72% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023.\n    * **C &I Banking/Hauppauge Business Banking Center:** Having recently marked its one-year anniversary, the Hauppauge Business Banking Center hit $73 million in deposits in the first year of operations. Loan originations tied to this office were $30 million during the quarter. Momentum continues to build with deposit and C&I loan pipelines related to this office of $59 million and $106 million, respectively.\n    * **Residential Lending:** The Bank continues to originate loans for its portfolio while developing the flow origination program launched in late 2023. Of the $24.2 million in closed loans originated in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, $21.2 million were originated for its portfolio and reflected a weighted average yield of 7.62% before origination and other fees, which average 50-100 bps per loan, and a weighted average LTV of 60%.\n  * **Tangible Book Value Per Share:** Tangible book value per share (including Series A preferred shares) was $23.05 at June 30, 2024 compared to $22.51 at December 31, 2023 (inclusive of a one-time CECL implementation adjustment of $3.2 million, net of tax, or $0.43 per share, recorded on October 1, 2023) and $22.26 at June 30, 2023.\n  * **Quarterly Cash Dividend:** The Company’s Board of Directors approved a $0.10 per share cash dividend on both common and Series A preferred shares payable on August 14, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 7, 2024.\n  * **Further Expansion into Long Island Markets** : The Company will once again be expanding its geographic footprint with the opening of a full-service branch in Port Jefferson, New York. Business development staff have already joined the Company in anticipation of the opening of this location. Subject to regulatory approvals, the Bank expects this site to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\nMINEOLA, N.Y., July 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hanover Bancorp, Inc. (“Hanover” or “the Company” – NASDAQ: HNVR), the holding company for Hanover Community Bank (“the Bank”), today reported results for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and the declaration of a $0.10 per share cash dividend on both common and Series A preferred shares payable on August 14, 2024 to stockholders of record on August 7, 2024.\n\n**Earnings Summary for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2024**\n\nThe Company reported net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 of $0.8 million (after giving effect to an ACL on an individually evaluated loan of $2.5 million and a $1.1 million provision resulting from ongoing enhancements to the CECL model) or $0.11 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares), versus $3.1 million or $0.42 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares) in the comparable 2023 quarter and $4.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares) for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Returns on average assets and average stockholders’ equity were 0.15% and 1.77%, respectively, for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, versus 0.60% and 6.82%, respectively, for the comparable quarter of 2023, and 0.74% and 8.70%, respectively, for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. Return on average tangible equity (“ROTCE”) was 1.97% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 compared to 7.64% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023 and 9.71% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThe decrease in net income recorded in the second quarter of 2024 from the comparable 2023 quarter resulted from an increase in the provision for credit losses, an increase in non-interest expense and a decrease in net interest income, which were partially offset by an increase in non-interest income, consisting primarily of gain on sale of loans held-for-sale. The Company recorded a $4.0 million provision for credit losses primarily attributable to an ACL on an individually evaluated loan of $2.5 million and $1.1 million related to ongoing enhancements to the CECL model during the June 2024 quarter. This $1.1 million provision was related to ongoing enhancements in our model not related to any deterioration in our portfolio. The increase in non-interest expense was attributed to a strategically planned reduction in certain lending activity resulting in lower deferred origination costs. Additionally, net interest income decreased due to the continued impact of higher funding costs resulting from the higher interest rates driven by the Federal Reserve. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 27.2% in the second quarter of 2024 from 29.9% in the comparable 2023 period.\n\nNet interest income was $13.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $0.3 million, or 1.9%, versus the comparable 2023 quarter due to compression of the Company’s net interest margin to 2.46% in the 2024 quarter from 2.68% in the comparable 2023 quarter. The yield on interest earning assets increased to 6.22% in the 2024 quarter from 5.65% in the comparable 2023 quarter, an increase of 57 basis points that was offset by a 96 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.48% in 2024 from 3.52% in the second quarter of 2023. Net interest income on a linked quarter basis increased $0.3 million or 2.41%, due to a 5 basis point increase in net interest margin resulting from a 19 basis point increase on yield on interest earning assets, partially offset by a 15 basis point increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n**Earnings Summary for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $4.9 million or $0.66 per diluted share (including Series A preferred shares), versus $6.3 million or $0.85 per diluted (including Series A preferred shares) in the comparable 2023 six-month period.\n\nThe decrease in net income recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from the comparable 2023 is due to similar factors discussed above. The Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 25.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from 26.7% in the comparable 2023 period.\n\nNet interest income was $26.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 4.5% from the comparable 2023 period due to compression of the Company’s net interest margin to 2.43% in the 2024 period from 2.85% in the comparable 2023 period. The yield on interest earning assets increased to 6.12% in the 2024 period from 5.56% in the comparable 2023 period, an increase of 56 basis points that was offset by a 116-basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 4.41% in 2024 from 3.25% in the comparable 2023 period due to the rapid and significant rise in interest rates.\n\nMichael P. Puorro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the Company’s quarterly results: “Second quarter results were impacted by credit-related matters that we believe are isolated in nature and not reflective of the quality of our portfolio. Independent of these impacts, our underlying performance continues to be strong, evidenced by increasing non- interest income, a recovering net interest margin and loan yields outpacing deposit costs. To ensure our sustained success, we have proactively adopted cost cutting measures intended to maximize efficiency and to support our continued strategic growth and onboarding of top tier professionals. Armed with a dedicated team and our diversified business verticals, we are well positioned for the future. The reduction in interest rates forecast by economists will create even greater opportunities due to the composition of our balance sheet and our ability to expand our core revenue drivers into new markets.”\n\n**Balance Sheet Highlights**\n\nTotal assets at June 30, 2024 were $2.33 billion versus $2.27 billion at December 31, 2023. Total securities available for sale at June 30, 2024 were $98.8 million, an increase of $37.4 million from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by growth in U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities.\n\nTotal deposits at June 30, 2024 increased to $1.94 billion compared to $1.90 billion at December 31, 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, total deposits increased $37.3 million or 2.0% from December 31, 2023. Our loan to deposit ratio was 104% at June 30, 2024 and 103% at December 31, 2023.\n\nAlthough core deposits, comprised of Demand, NOW, Savings and Money Market, grew to $1.48 billion as of June 30, 2024 from $1.38 billion as of December 31, 2023, Demand deposit balances decreased from $207.8 million to $199.9 million during the same period. This decrease was confined to deposits made by residential loan borrowers in anticipation of residential loan closings. These funds comprise the equity residential borrowers are required to contribute to residential loan closings and the volume of these deposits rise and fall in proportion to the volume of anticipated residential loan closings. As the pace of residential lending increases, the volume of Demand deposits will increase accordingly. Demand deposits, net of balances related to residential loan closings, grew to $177.8 million as of June 30, 2024 from $166.4 million as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 6.8%, underscoring the continued success of our C&I Banking vertical.\n\nThe Company had $452.6 million in total municipal deposits at June 30, 2024, at a weighted average rate of 4.61% versus $528.1 million at a weighted average rate of 4.62% at December 31, 2023. The Company’s municipal deposit program is built on long-standing relationships developed in the local marketplace. This core deposit business will continue to provide a stable source of funding for the Company’s lending products at costs lower than those of consumer deposits and market-based borrowings. The Company continues to broaden its municipal deposit base and currently services 39 customer relationships.\n\nTotal borrowings at June 30, 2024 were $149.0 million, with a weighted average rate and term of 3.96% and 21 months, respectively. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $121.7 million and $126.7 million, respectively, of term FHLB advances outstanding. The Company had $25.0 million of FHLB overnight borrowings outstanding at June 30, 2024 and none at December 31, 2023. The Company had no borrowings outstanding under lines of credit with correspondent banks at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company utilizes a number of strategies to manage interest rate risk, including interest rate swap agreements which currently provide a benefit to net interest income.\n\nStockholders’ equity was $190.1 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $184.8 million at December 31, 2023. The $5.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase of $3.4 million in retained earnings and a decrease of $1.1 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The increase in retained earnings was due primarily to net income of $4.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, which was offset by $1.5 million of dividends declared. The accumulated other comprehensive loss at June 30, 2024 was 0.70% of total equity and was comprised of a $1.4 million after tax net unrealized loss on the investment portfolio, partially offset by a $0.1 million after tax net unrealized gain on derivatives.\n\n**Loan Portfolio**\n\nOn a linked quarter basis, the Company experienced net loan growth of $7.4 million, a 1.5% increase on an annualized basis. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Bank’s loan portfolio grew to $2.01 billion, for an increase of $55.8 million or 5.7% annualized. Growth was concentrated primarily in residential, SBA and C&I loans. At June 30, 2024, the Company’s residential loan portfolio (including home equity) amounted to $761.0 million, with an average loan balance of $493 thousand and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57%. Commercial real estate and multifamily loans totaled $1.11 billion at June 30, 2024, with an average loan balance of $1.5 million and a weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 59%. As will be discussed below, only approximately 37% of our multifamily portfolio is subject to rent regulation. The Company’s commercial real estate concentration ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 403% of capital at June 30, 2024 from 432% of capital at December 31, 2023, with loans secured by office space accounting for 2.3% of the total loan portfolio and totaling $46.2 million. The Company’s loan pipeline at June 30, 2024 is approximately $164 million, with approximately 97% being niche-residential, conventional C&I and SBA and USDA lending opportunities.\n\nHistorically, the Bank generated additional income by strategically originating and selling residential and government guaranteed loans to other financial institutions at premiums, while also retaining servicing rights in some sales. However, with the rapid increases in interest rates in recent years, the appetite among the Bank’s purchasers of residential loans for acquiring pools of loans declined, eliminating the Bank’s ability to sell residential loans in its portfolio on desirable terms. Commencing in late 2023, the Bank initiated development of a flow origination program under which the Bank originates individual loans for sale to specific buyers, thereby positioning the Bank to resume residential loan sales and generate fee income to complement sale premiums earned from the origination of SBA loans. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold $2.9 million of residential loans under this program and recorded gains on sale of loans held-for-sale of $0.1 million. We expect the volume of activity to increase as the year progresses and our flow pipeline continues to build. Because we continue to prioritize the management of liquidity and capital, new business development is largely focused on flow originations over portfolio growth.\n\nThe Bank’s investment in government guaranteed lending continues to yield results. During the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company sold $28.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively, of SBA loans and recorded gains on sale of loans held-for-sale of $2.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\n\n**Commercial Real Estate Statistics**\n\nA significant portion of the Bank’s commercial real estate portfolio consists of loans secured by Multi-Family and CRE-Investor owned real estate that are predominantly subject to fixed interest rates for an initial period of 5 years. The Bank’s exposure to Land/Construction loans is minor at $10 million, all at floating interest rates, and CRE-owner occupied loans have a sizable mix of floating rates. As shown below, these two portfolios have only 11% combined of loans maturing through the balance of 2024 and 2025, with 54% maturing in 2027 alone.\n\n**Multi-Family Market Rent Portfolio Fixed Rate Reset/Maturity Schedule** | **Multi-Family Stabilized Rent Portfolio Fixed Rate Reset/Maturity Schedule**  \n---|---  \nCalendar Period (loan data as of 6/30/24 | # Loans | Total O/S ($000's omitted) | Avg O/S ($000'somitted) | Avg Interest Rate | Calendar Period (loan data as of 6/30/24 | # Loans | Total O/S ($000's omitted) | Avg O/S ($000's omitted) | Avg Interest Rate  \n2024 | 6 | $ | 3,995 | $ | 666 | 7.56 | % | 2024 | 6 | $ | 5,793 | $ | 966 | 6.17 | %  \n2025 | 9 | 16,002 | 1,778 | 4.03 | % | 2025 | 12 | 17,307 | 1,442 | 4.32 | %  \n2026 | 36 | 119,775 | 3,327 | 3.66 | % | 2026 | 21 | 45,145 | 2,150 | 3.67 | %  \n2027 | 72 | 179,217 | 2,489 | 4.31 | % | 2027 | 53 | 126,061 | 2,379 | 4.22 | %  \n2028 | 18 | 30,089 | 1,672 | 6.16 | % | 2028 | 11 | 9,998 | 909 | 7.12 | %  \n2029+ | 7 | 4,428 | 633 | 7.18 | % | 2029+ | 5 | 2,361 | 472 | 6.39 | %  \n**Fixed Rate** | **148** | **353,506** | **2,389** | **4.31** | **%** | **Fixed Rate** | **108** | **206,665** | **1,914** | **4.33** | **%**  \n**Floating Rate** | **3** | **458** | **153** | **10.06** | **%** | **Floating Rate** | **1** | **1,801** | **1,801** | **6.25** | **%**  \n**Total** | **151** | **$** | **353,964** | **$** | **2,344** | **4.31** | **%** | **Total** | **109** | **$** | **208,466** | **$** | **1,913** | **4.34** | **%**  \n  \n**CRE Investor Portfolio Fixed Rate Reset/Maturity Schedule**  \n---  \nCalendar Period (loan data as of 6/30/24 | # Loans | Total O/S ($000's omitted) | Avg O/S ($000's omitted) | Avg Interest Rate  \n2024 | 20 | $ | 20,305 | $ | 1,015 | 6.73 | %  \n2025 | 29 | 19,507 | 673 | 5.13 | %  \n2026 | 33 | 46,059 | 1,396 | 4.85 | %  \n2027 | 90 | 164,798 | 1,831 | 4.67 | %  \n2028 | 32 | 33,034 | 1,032 | 6.65 | %  \n2029+ | 14 | 5,682 | 406 | 6.03 | %  \n**Fixed Rate** | **218** | **289,385** | **1,327** | **5.13** | **%**  \n**Floating Rate** | **5** | **14,346** | **2,869** | **9.04** | **%**  \n**Total CRE-Inv.** | **223** | **$** | **303,731** | **$** | **1,362** | **5.31** | **%**  \n  \n**Rental breakdown of Multi-Family portfolio**\n\nThe table below segments our portfolio of loans secured by Multi-Family properties based on rental terms and location.

The portfolio has no delinquencies, defaults or modifications.\n\n**Asset Quality and Allowance for Credit Losses**\n\nThe Bank’s asset quality ratios remain solid. At June 30, 2024, the Company reported $15.8 million in non-performing loans which represented 0.79% of total loans outstanding. Non-performing loans were $14.5 million at December 31, 2023 and $14.9 million at March 31, 2024. During the quarter, a $4.4 million non-performing commercial real estate note was sold and a $1.2 million non-performing residential loan paid in full. This commercial real estate loan was the Bank’s largest non-performing asset, and was sold with no loss to the Bank. Offsetting these decreases was the addition of a $3.8 million loan relationship comprised of two SBA loans in the amount of $1.3 million (non-guaranteed portion) and a commercial loan in the amount of $2.5 million. Subsequent to June 30, a $1.2 million non-performing residential investor loan paid in full, lowering our current non-performing loans to $14.6 million.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Bank recorded a provision for credit losses expense of $4.0 million. The June 30, 2024, allowance for credit losses balance was $23.6 million versus $19.7 million at December 31, 2023 and $15.4 million at June 30, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans is attributable to an ACL on an individually evaluated loan of $2.5 million and $1.1 million related to ongoing enhancements to the CECL model during the June 2024 quarter. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans was 1.17% at June 30, 2024 versus 1.00% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Margin**\n\nThe Bank’s net interest margin increased to 2.46% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 from 2.41% in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The increase from the prior linked quarter was primarily related to the increase in the average yield on loans, partially offset by the increase in the average cost of deposits and borrowings. The Bank’s net interest margin was 2.68% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. The decrease from the prior year quarter was primarily related to the increase in the total cost of funds, partially offset by the increase in the average yield on loans and, to a lesser extent, the Company’s decision to increase liquidity as a result of the industry events over the last two years. The year over year margin compression reflects the effects of the rapid and significant rise in interest rates and the competitive deposit environment. We believe the Company is well positioned for the current or more favorable interest rate environments.\n\n**About Hanover Community Bank and Hanover Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nHanover Bancorp, Inc.

While management uses non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance, this information should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  \n(2) Includes common stock and Series A preferred stock.  \n  \n**HANOVER BANCORP, INC.**  \n---  \n**NET INTEREST INCOME ANALYSIS**  \n**For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n**(unaudited, dollars in thousands)**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nAverage | Average | Average | Average  \nBalance | Interest | Yield/Cost | Balance | Interest | Yield/Cost  \n**Assets:**  \nInterest-earning assets:  \nLoans | $ | 2,014,820 | $ | 31,124 | 6.21 | % | $ | 1,798,651 | $ | 25,581 | 5.70 | %  \nInvestment securities | 99,324 | 1,534 | 6.21 | % | 15,885 | 198 | 5.00 | %  \nInterest-earning cash | 36,633 | 497 | 5.46 | % | 195,883 | 2,494 | 5.11 | %  \nFHLB stock and other investments | 11,473 | 265 | 9.29 | % | 9,974 | 186 | 7.48 | %  \nTotal interest-earning assets | 2,162,250 | 33,420 | 6.22 | % | 2,020,393 | 28,459 | 5.65 | %  \nNon interest-earning assets:  \nCash and due from banks | 7,979 | 8,240  \nOther assets | 51,106 | 53,511  \nTotal assets | $ | 2,221,335 | $ | 2,082,144  \n**Liabilities and stockholders' equity:**  \nInterest-bearing liabilities:  \nSavings, N.O.W. and money market deposits | $ | 1,117,029 | $ | 12,667 | 4.56 | % | $ | 1,080,328 | $ | 9,905 | 3.68 | %  \nTime deposits | 461,489 | 4,910 | 4.28 | % | 437,202 | 3,214 | 2.95 | %  \nTotal savings and time deposits | 1,578,518 | 17,577 | 4.48 | % | 1,517,530 | 13,119 | 3.47 | %  \nBorrowings | 206,820 | 2,270 | 4.41 | % | 160,079 | 1,501 | 3.76 | %  \nSubordinated debentures | 24,653 | 326 | 5.32 | % | 24,599 | 334 | 5.45 | %  \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities | 1,809,991 | 20,173 | 4.48 | % | 1,702,208 | 14,954 | 3.52 | %  \nDemand deposits | 194,687 | 174,515  \nOther liabilities | 25,039 | 23,490  \nTotal liabilities | 2,029,717 | 1,900,213  \nStockholders' equity | 191,618 | 181,931  \nTotal liabilities & stockholders' equity | $ | 2,221,335 | $ | 2,082,144  \nNet interest rate spread | 1.74 | % | 2.13 | %  \n**Net interest income/margin** | **$** | **13,247** | **2.46** | **%** | **$** | **13,505** | **2.68** | **%**  \n  \n**HANOVER BANCORP, INC.**  \n---  \n**NET INTEREST INCOME ANALYSIS**  \n**For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023**  \n**(unaudited, dollars in thousands)**  \n**2024** | **2023**  \nAverage | Average | Average | Average  \nBalance | Interest | Yield/Cost | Balance | Interest | Yield/Cost  \n**Assets:**  \nInterest-earning assets:  \nLoans | $ | 1,999,448 | $ | 60,861 | 6.12 | % | $ | 1,782,753 | $ | 49,522 | 5.60 | %  \nInvestment securities | 97,085 | 2,991 | 6.20 | % | 16,145 | 396 | 4.95 | %  \nInterest-earning cash | 55,652 | 1,511 | 5.46 | % | 132,448 | 3,282 | 5.00 | %  \nFHLB stock and other investments | 10,358 | 489 | 9.49 | % | 8,190 | 319 | 7.85 | %  \nTotal interest-earning assets | 2,162,543 | 65,852 | 6.12 | % | 1,939,536 | 53,519 | 5.56 | %  \nNon interest-earning assets:  \nCash and due from banks | 7,962 | 9,020  \nOther assets | 50,523 | 53,762  \nTotal assets | $ | 2,221,028 | $ | 2,002,318  \n**Liabilities and stockholders' equity:**  \nInterest-bearing liabilities:  \nSavings, N.O.W. and money market deposits | $ | 1,139,111 | $ | 25,600 | 4.52 | % | $ | 1,046,770 | $ | 17,697 | 3.41 | %  \nTime deposits | 474,134 | 9,872 | 4.19 | % | 423,003 | 5,597 | 2.67 | %  \nTotal savings and time deposits | 1,613,245 | 35,472 | 4.42 | % | 1,469,773 | 23,294 | 3.20 | %  \nBorrowings | 172,304 | 3,546 | 4.14 | % | 124,305 | 2,128 | 3.45 | %  \nSubordinated debentures | 24,646 | 652 | 5.32 | % | 24,593 | 668 | 5.48 | %  \nTotal interest-bearing liabilities | 1,810,195 | 39,670 | 4.41 | % | 1,618,671 | 26,090 | 3.25 | %  \nDemand deposits | 194,679 | 178,336  \nOther liabilities | 26,499 | 24,385  \nTotal liabilities | 2,031,373 | 1,821,392  \nStockholders' equity | 189,655 | 180,926  \nTotal liabilities & stockholders' equity | $ | 2,221,028 | $ | 2,002,318  \nNet interest rate spread | 1.71 | % | 2.31 | %  \n**Net interest income/margin** | **$** | **26,182** | **2.43** | **%** | **$** | **27,429** | **2.85** | **%**  \n  \nInvestor and Press Contact: Lance P.
