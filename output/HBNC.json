(“Horizon” or the “Company”), the parent company of Horizon Bank (the “Bank”), announced its unaudited financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $18.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.1 million, or $0.32, for the second quarter of 2024 and compared to net income of $16.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $46.3 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $53.2 million, or $1.21, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net interest income increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to $46.9 million, compared to $45.3 million in the linked quarter of 2024. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis1, expanded for the fourth consecutive quarter to 2.66%, compared to 2.64% in the linked quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * Total loans held for investment (\"HFI\") were $4.8 billion at September 30, 2024, relatively unchanged from June 30, 2024 balances. However, consistent with the Company's stated growth strategy, the commercial portfolio showed continued organic growth momentum during the quarter, which was offset with planned run-off of lower-yielding indirect auto loans in the consumer loan portfolio. \n\n\n  * Positive deposit growth of 1.7% during the quarter, to $5.7 billion at period end. The quarter was highlighted by stable non-interest bearing deposit balances and growth in core relationship consumer and commercial portfolios. \n\n\n  * Credit quality remains strong, with annualized net charge offs of 0.03% of average loans during the third quarter. Non-performing assets to total assets of 0.32% remains well within expected ranges, with no material change in the loss outlook. Provision for loan losses of $1.0 million reflects continued positive credit performance.\n\n\n\n“Horizon continues to execute well on its key strategic initiatives of consistently improving our operating performance through a more productive balance sheet, growth in non-interest income and continued disciplined in our operating model. As a result, we are optimistic on the positive momentum of the franchise through year-end 2024 and into 2025. During the quarter, our commercial team was able to deliver another quarter of quality loan growth, even coming off a strong end to the second quarter. The strength of Horizon's core deposit franchise showed solid performance, and our credit metrics remain well managed. These efforts led to a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in pre-tax pre-provision income,\" President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas M. Prame said. \"Importantly, we continue our efforts to optimize our business model, and are pleased to announce the repositioning of a portion of our securities portfolio and the intended sale of our mortgage warehouse business during the fourth quarter. These shareholder accretive actions are expected to yield sustainable improvement in the profitability of our business that will be evident in the fourth quarter, and positively impact Horizon's financial performance in 2025.\"\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric. See non-GAAP reconciliation included herein for the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Accretive Fourth Quarter 2024 Strategic Actions**\n\nHorizon announced strategic actions taking place in the fourth quarter of 2024, which are designed to simplify its business, strengthen the balance sheet and improve long-term structural profitability. In October, the Company completed the repositioning of about $325 million of available-for-sale securities. Additionally, the Company has signed a letter of intent to sell its mortgage warehouse business, which is expected to generate a gain-on-sale. Details on these actions, the use of proceeds, and the expected financial impact are available in the Company's third quarter 2024 investor presentation published at [investor.horizonbank.com](http://investor.horizonbank.com).\n\n**Financial Highlights**  \n---  \n(Dollars in Thousands Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, Unaudited)  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**Income statement:**  \nNet interest income| $| 46,910| $| 45,279| $| 43,288| $| 42,257| $| 42,090  \nCredit loss expense| 1,044| 2,369| 805| 1,274| 263  \nNon-interest income| 11,511| 10,485| 9,929| (20,449| )| 11,830  \nNon-interest expense| 39,272| 37,522| 37,107| 39,330| 36,168  \nIncome tax expense| (75| )| 1,733| 1,314| 6,419| 1,284  \nNet income| $| 18,180| $| 14,140| $| 13,991| $| (25,215| )| $| 16,205  \n**Per share data:**  \nBasic earnings per share| $| 0.42| $| 0.32| $| 0.32| $| (0.58| )| $| 0.37  \nDiluted earnings per share| 0.41| 0.32| 0.32| (0.58| )| 0.37  \nCash dividends declared per common share| 0.16| 0.16| 0.16| 0.16| 0.16  \nBook value per common share| 17.27| 16.62| 16.49| 16.47| 15.89  \nMarket value - high| 16.57| 12.74| 14.44| 14.65| 12.68  \nMarket value - low| 11.89| 11.29| 11.75| 9.33| 9.90  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - Basic| 43,712,059| 43,712,059| 43,663,610| 43,649,585| 43,646,609  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - Diluted| 44,112,321| 43,987,187| 43,874,036| 43,649,585| 43,796,069  \nCommon shares outstanding (end of period)| 43,712,059| 43,712,059| 43,726,380| 43,652,063| 43,648,501  \n**Key ratios:**  \nReturn on average assets| 0.92| %| 0.73| %| 0.72| %| (1.27) %| 0.81| %  \nReturn on average stockholders' equity| 9.80| 7.83| 7.76| (14.23| )| 8.99  \nTotal equity to total assets| 9.52| 9.18| 9.18| 9.06| 8.71  \nTotal loans to deposit ratio| 83.92| 85.70| 82.78| 78.01| 76.52  \nAllowance for credit losses to HFI loans| 1.10| 1.08| 1.09| 1.13| 1.14  \nAnnualized net charge-offs of average total loans(1)| 0.03| 0.05| 0.04| 0.07| 0.07  \nEfficiency ratio| 67.22| 67.29| 69.73| 180.35| 67.08  \n**Key metrics (Non-GAAP)****(2)****:**  \nNet FTE interest margin| 2.66| %| 2.64| %| 2.50| %| 2.43| %| 2.41| %  \nReturn on average tangible common equity| 12.65| 10.18| 10.11| (18.76| )| 11.79  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets| 7.58| 7.22| 7.20| 7.08| 6.72  \nTangible book value per common share| $| 13.46| $| 12.80| $| 12.65| $| 12.60| $| 12.00  \n(1) Average total loans includes loans held for investment and held for sale.  \n(2) Non-GAAP financial metrics. See non-GAAP reconciliation included herein for the most directly comparable GAAP measures.  \n  \n**Income Statement Highlights**\n\n**Net Interest Income**\n\nNet interest income was $46.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $45.3 million in the second quarter of 2024, driven by net growth in average interest earning assets of $117.5 million and continued net FTE interest margin expansion during the quarter. Horizon’s net FTE interest margin1 was 2.66% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.64% for the second quarter of 2024, attributable to the favorable mix shift in average interest earning assets toward higher-yielding loans and in the average funding mix toward lower-cost deposit balances. Interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans did not contribute significantly to the third quarter net interest income, or net FTE interest margin.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.0 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $2.4 million during the second quarter of 2024, and $0.3 million during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the second quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to less total loan growth in the current quarter relative to the prior quarter.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the allowance for credit losses included net charge-offs of $0.4 million, or an annualized 0.03% of average loans outstanding, compared to net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or an annualized 0.05% of average loans outstanding for the second quarter of 2024, and net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or an annualized 0.07% of average loans outstanding, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans HFI was 1.10% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.08% at June 30, 2024 and 1.14% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**| **September 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in Thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**Non-interest Income**  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 3,320| $| 3,130| $| 3,214| $| 3,092| $| 3,086  \nWire transfer fees| 123| 113| 101| 103| 120  \nInterchange fees| 3,511| 3,826| 3,109| 3,224| 3,186  \nFiduciary activities| 1,394| 1,372| 1,315| 1,352| 1,206  \nGains (losses) on sale of investment securities| —| —| —| (31,572| )| —  \nGain on sale of mortgage loans| 1,622| 896| 626| 951| 1,582  \nMortgage servicing income net of impairment| 412| 450| 439| 724| 631  \nIncrease in cash value of bank owned life insurance| 349| 318| 298| 658| 1,055  \nOther income| 780| 380| 827| 1,019| 964  \nTotal non-interest income| $| 11,511| $| 10,485| $| 9,929| $| (20,449| )| $| 11,830  \n  \nTotal non-interest income was $11.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, due primarily to higher realized gains on sale of mortgage loans and increased other income.\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric. See non-GAAP reconciliation included herein for the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Non-Interest Expense**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**| **September 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in Thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**Non-interest Expense**  \nSalaries and employee benefits| $| 21,829| $| 20,583| $| 20,268| $| 21,877| $| 20,058  \nNet occupancy expenses| 3,207| 3,192| 3,546| 3,260| 3,283  \nData processing| 2,977| 2,579| 2,464| 2,942| 2,999  \nProfessional fees| 676| 714| 607| 772| 707  \nOutside services and consultants| 3,677| 3,058| 3,359| 2,394| 2,316  \nLoan expense| 1,034| 1,038| 719| 1,345| 1,120  \nFDIC insurance expense| 1,204| 1,315| 1,320| 1,200| 1,300  \nCore deposit intangible amortization| 844| 844| 872| 903| 903  \nOther losses| 297| 515| 16| 508| 188  \nOther expense| 3,527| 3,684| 3,936| 4,129| 3,294  \nTotal non-interest expense| $| 39,272| $| 37,522| $| 37,107| $| 39,330| $| 36,168  \n  \nTotal non-interest expense was $39.3 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $37.5 million in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in non-interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a $1.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, which is partially attributable to a legacy benefits program expense, and a $0.6 million increase in outside services and consultants expense related to strategic initiatives.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nHorizon's effective tax rate was -0.4% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 10.9% for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate during the third quarter was primarily due to an increase in net realizable tax credits for the current year, which reduced the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nTotal assets increased by $14.9 million, or 0.2%, to $7.93 billion as of September 30, 2024, from $7.91 billion as of June 30, 2024. The increase in total assets is primarily due to increases in federal funds sold of $79.5 million, or 230.6%, to $113.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $34.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The increase in federal funds sold during the period was partially offset by a decrease in other assets of $46.6 million, or 28.1%, to $119.0 million as of September 30, 2024, from $165.7 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nTotal investment securities remained unchanged, at $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to June 30, 2024, as the positive market impact to available for sale securities was offset by normal pay-downs and maturities. There were no purchases of investment securities during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal loans HFI and loans held for sale were relatively consistent at $4.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2024, as growth in commercial loans of $9.5 million were offset by a decline in consumer loans of $43.3 million.\n\nTotal deposit balances increased by $96.9 million, or 1.7%, to $5.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 when compared to balances as of June 30, 2024. Non-interest bearing deposit balances were essentially unchanged during the quarter.\n\nTotal borrowings decreased by $86.4 million, or 7.0%, to $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, primarily related to the repayment of a portion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, when compared to balances as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Capital**\n\nThe following table presents the consolidated regulatory capital ratios of the Company for the previous three quarters:\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024***|  **2024**| **2024****|  **2023****  \n **Consolidated Capital Ratios**  \nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 13.52| %| 13.41| %| 13.75| %| 14.04| %  \nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 11.70| %| 11.59| %| 11.89| %| 12.13| %  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.74| %| 10.63| %| 10.89| %| 11.11| %  \nTier 1 capital (to average assets)| 9.01| %| 9.02| %| 8.91| %| 8.61| %  \n*Preliminary estimate - may be subject to change  \n**Prior periods were previously revised (see disclosure in Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2024)  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total stockholders’ equity to total assets is 9.52%. Book value per common share was $17.27, increasing $0.65 during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTangible common equity1 totaled $588.5 million at September 30, 2024, and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 was 7.58% at September 30, 2024, up from 7.22% at June 30, 2024. Tangible book value, which excludes intangible assets from total equity, per common share1 was $13.46, increasing $0.66 during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total non-accrual loans increased by $5.3 million, or 29.0%, from June 30, 2024, to 0.49% of total loans HFI. Total non-performing assets increased $5.1 million, or 25.0%, to $25.6 million, compared to $20.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets increased to 0.32% compared to 0.26% as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, net charge-offs decreased by $0.2 million to $0.4 million, compared to $0.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and remain just 0.03% annualized of average loans.\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric.

Specifically, we have included non-GAAP financial measures relating to net income, diluted earnings per share, pre-tax, pre-provision net income, net interest margin, tangible stockholders’ equity and tangible book value per share, efficiency ratio, the return on average assets, the return on average common equity, and return on average tangible equity. In each case, we have identified special circumstances that we consider to be non-recurring and have excluded them. We believe that this shows the impact of such events as acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments and swap termination fees, among others we have identified in our reconciliations. Horizon believes these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors and provide a greater understanding of our business and financial results without giving effect to the purchase accounting impacts and one-time costs of acquisitions and non–recurring items. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. See the tables and other information below and contained elsewhere in this press release for reconciliations of the non-GAAP information identified herein and its most comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward–looking statements regarding the financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies of Horizon Bancorp, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Horizon”). For these statements, Horizon claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release should be considered in conjunction with the other information available about Horizon, including the information in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.\n\nAlthough management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include: current financial conditions within the banking industry; changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in spreads on earning assets and changes in interest bearing liabilities; increased interest rate sensitivity; the aggregate effects of elevated inflation levels in recent years; loss of key Horizon personnel; increases in disintermediation; potential loss of fee income, including interchange fees, as new and emerging alternative payment platforms take a greater market share of the payment systems; estimates of fair value of certain of Horizon’s assets and liabilities; changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses, market values, collateral securing loans and other assets; changes in sources of liquidity; macroeconomic conditions and their impact on Horizon and its customers; legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be adopted and required by regulatory agencies; litigation, regulatory enforcement, and legal compliance risk and costs; rapid technological developments and changes; cyber terrorism and data security breaches; the rising costs of cybersecurity; the ability of the U.S. federal government to manage federal debt limits; climate change and social justice initiatives; the inability to realize cost savings or revenues or to effectively implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures; acts of terrorism, war and global conflicts, such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the Israel and Hamas conflict; and supply chain disruptions and delays. These and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Horizon’s reports (such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website ([www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov)).

(“Horizon” or the “Company”), the parent company of Horizon Bank (the “Bank”), announced its unaudited financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.\n\nNet income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $14.1 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.0 million, or $0.32, for the first quarter of 2024 and compared to net income of $18.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $28.1 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, compared to net income of $37.0 million, or $0.85, for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net interest income increased for the third consecutive quarter to $45.3 million, compared to $43.3 million in the linked quarter of 2024. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis1, expanded for the third consecutive quarter to 2.64%, compared to 2.50% in the linked quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * Total loans held for investment (\"HFI\") were $4.8 billion at period end, increasing by 4.4% during the quarter, led by organic commercial loan growth of $154.8 million, or 5.6% in the quarter.\n\n\n  * Credit quality continues to perform well, with non-accrual loans declining $0.8 million, to $18.3 million at June 30, 2024 from March 31, 2024. Annualized net charge-offs remain low, at 0.05% of average loans during the second quarter. Provision for loan losses of $2.4 million primarily reflected continued loan growth in the quarter.\n\n\n  * Deposits totaled $5.6 billion at period end, increasing by 0.9% during the quarter. Non-interest bearing deposit balances at June 30, 2024 were relatively consistent with balances at March 31, 2024.\n\n\n\n“We are proud of the Company's performance during the second quarter, which was highlighted by sequential growth in revenue and pre-tax pre-provision income resulting from the strategic shift of Horizon’s balance sheet toward a more profitable earning asset mix, and diligent expense management. Importantly, the previously discussed balance sheet efforts drove improving loan yields, which coupled with the relative stability of our funding costs, yielded 14 basis points of net interest margin expansion in the quarter,” President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas M. Prame said. “In-market businesses and consumers remain at the center of Horizon’s strong credit performance and low-cost deposit franchise, and our Indiana and Michigan markets continue to provide excellent opportunities for organic growth.

Horizon’s net FTE interest margin1 was 2.64% for the second quarter of 2024, compared to 2.50% for the first quarter of 2024, attributable to the favorable mix shift in average interest earning assets toward higher-yielding loans against relatively stable costs of interest bearing liabilities. Interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans did not contribute significantly to the second quarter net interest income, or net FTE interest margin.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.4 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $0.8 million during the first quarter of 2024, and $0.7 million during the second quarter of 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses during the second quarter of 2024 when compared with the first quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to loan growth.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, the allowance for credit losses included net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or an annualized 0.05% of average loans outstanding, compared to net charge-offs of $0.4 million, or an annualized 0.04% of average loans outstanding for the first quarter of 2024, and net charge-offs of $0.3 million, or an annualized 0.04% of average loans outstanding, in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans HFI was 1.08% at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.09% at March 31, 2024 and 1.17% at June 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in Thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**Non-interest Income**  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 3,130| $| 3,214| $| 3,092| $| 3,086| $| 3,021  \nWire transfer fees| 113| 101| 103| 120| 116  \nInterchange fees| 3,826| 3,109| 3,224| 3,186| 3,584  \nFiduciary activities| 1,372| 1,315| 1,352| 1,206| 1,247  \nGains (losses) on sale of investment securities| —| —| (31,572| )| —| 20  \nGain on sale of mortgage loans| 896| 626| 951| 1,582| 1,005  \nMortgage servicing income net of impairment| 450| 439| 724| 631| 640  \nIncrease in cash value of bank owned life insurance| 318| 298| 658| 1,055| 1,015  \nOther income| 380| 827| 1,019| 964| 349  \nTotal non-interest income| $| 10,485| $| 9,929| $| (20,449| )| $| 11,830| $| 10,997  \n  \nTotal non-interest income was $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2024, due primarily to increased interchange fees and higher realized gain on sale of mortgage loans.\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric.

The sequential increase in the effective tax rate brings the year-to-date effective tax rate to 9.8%, consistent with the Company's current estimated annual effective tax rate.\n\n**B****alance Sheet**\n\nTotal assets increased by $56.8 million, or 0.7%, to $7.91 billion as of June 30, 2024, from $7.86 billion as of March 31, 2024. The increase in total assets is primarily due to increases in gross loans HFI of $204.7 million, or 4.4%, to $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2024, compared to $4.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. Loan growth during the period was partially offset by a decrease in fed funds sold of $127.3 million, or 78.7%, to $34.5 million as of June 30, 2024, from $161.7 million as of March 31, 2024.\n\nTotal investment securities decreased $29.7 million, or 1.2%, to $2.4 billion as of June 30, 2024, from $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2024, primarily as a result of normal pay-downs and maturities. There were no purchases of investment securities during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal loans HFI and loans held for sale increased to $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2024 compared to $4.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, led by organic commercial loan growth of $154.8 million.\n\nTotal deposit balances increased by $50.3 million, or 0.9%, to $5.6 billion on June 30, 2024 when compared to balances as of March 31, 2024.\n\nAll other interest bearing liabilities at June 30, 2024, primarily comprised of Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis advances, remained relatively stable when compared to balances as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**Capital**\n\nThe following table presents the consolidated regulatory capital ratios of the Company for the previous three quarters:\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**  \n---|---|---|---  \n**2024***|  **2024****|  **2023****  \n **Consolidated Capital Ratios**  \nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 13.36| %| 13.75| %| 14.04| %  \nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 11.56| %| 11.89| %| 12.13| %  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.60| %| 10.89| %| 11.11| %  \nTier 1 capital (to average assets)| 8.98| %| 8.91| %| 8.61| %  \n*Preliminary estimate - may be subject to change  \n**Prior periods have been revised (see disclosure below)  \n  \nDuring the second quarter of 2024 management corrected a prior computation of the Company’s total capital (to risk-weighted assets), Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets), and Tier 1 capital (to average assets) ratios for purposes of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for holding companies filed with the Federal Reserve (the “Regulatory Filings”), which involved an incorrect classification of the Company’s subordinated notes as Tier 1 capital. The Company evaluated the effects of the incorrect classification to its previously filed Regulatory Filings and previously issued financial statements and determined the errors were not material to either of the prior periods noted above. The Company has amended its Regulatory Filings for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to reclassify the subordinated notes balance from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital. The correction of the classification had no effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of income, stockholders’ equity, or the amounts or disclosure of the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank as included in its call reports. The Company continues to exceed regulatory proxy ratios to be considered “well capitalized”, plus the capital conservation buffer, at June 30, 2024. The Company will reflect the reclassification of the subordinated notes described above in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the ratio of total stockholders’ equity to total assets is 9.18%. Book value per common share was $16.62, increasing $0.13 during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nTangible common equity1 totaled $559.5 million at June 30, 2024, and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 was 7.22% at June 30, 2024. Tangible book value, which excludes intangible assets from total equity, per common share1 was $12.80, increasing $0.15 during the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, total non-accrual loans decreased by $0.8 million, or 4.1%, from March 31, 2024, to 0.38% of total loans HFI. Total non-performing assets increased $0.2 million, or 0.8%, to $20.5 million, compared to $20.3 million as of March 31, 2024. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets was unchanged compared to the first quarter of 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, net charge-offs increased by $0.2 million to $0.6 million, compared to $0.4 million as of March 31, 2024, but remain low at 0.05% annualized of average loan balances.\n\n**Earnings Conference Call**\n\nAs previously announced, Horizon will host a conference call to review its second quarter financial results and operating performance.\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric.

Specifically, we have included non-GAAP financial measures relating to net income, diluted earnings per share, pre-tax, pre-provision net income, net interest margin, tangible stockholders’ equity and tangible book value per share, efficiency ratio, the return on average assets, the return on average common equity, and return on average tangible equity. In each case, we have identified special circumstances that we consider to be non-recurring and have excluded them. We believe that this shows the impact of such events as acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments and swap termination fees, among others we have identified in our reconciliations. Horizon believes these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors and provide a greater understanding of our business and financial results without giving effect to the purchase accounting impacts and one-time costs of acquisitions and non–recurring items. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. See the tables and other information below and contained elsewhere in this press release for reconciliations of the non-GAAP information identified herein and its most comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward–looking statements regarding the financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies of Horizon Bancorp, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Horizon”). For these statements, Horizon claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release should be considered in conjunction with the other information available about Horizon, including the information in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.\n\nAlthough management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include: current financial conditions within the banking industry, including the effects of recent failures of other financial institutions, liquidity levels, and responses by the Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to address these issues; changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in spreads on earning assets and changes in interest bearing liabilities; increased interest rate sensitivity; the ability of Horizon to remediate its material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting; continuing increases in inflation; loss of key Horizon personnel; increases in disintermediation; potential loss of fee income, including interchange fees, as new and emerging alternative payment platforms take a greater market share of the payment systems; estimates of fair value of certain of Horizon’s assets and liabilities; changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses, market values, collateral securing loans and other assets; changes in sources of liquidity; economic conditions and their impact on Horizon and its customers, including local and global economic recovery from the pandemic; legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be adopted and required by regulatory agencies; litigation, regulatory enforcement, and legal compliance risk and costs; rapid technological developments and changes; cyber terrorism and data security breaches; the rising costs of cybersecurity; the ability of the U.S. federal government to manage federal debt limits; climate change and social justice initiatives; the inability to realize cost savings or revenues or to effectively implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures; acts of terrorism, war and global conflicts, such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the Israel and Hamas conflict; and supply chain disruptions and delays. These and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Horizon’s reports (such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website ([www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov)). Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward–looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Horizon does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward–looking statement is made, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.\n\n**Condensed Consolidated

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nNote 1 - Accounting Policies\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the 2023 condensed consolidated financial statements to be comparable to 2024. These\nreclassifications were not material and had no effect on net income.\nRevisions to Previously Issued Financial Statements\nIn connection with the preparation of its financial statements for the second quarter of 2024, management corrected a prior computation of the\nCompany’s total capital (to risk-weighted assets), Tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets), and Tier 1 capital (to average assets) ratios for\npurposes of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for holding companies filed with the Federal Reserve (the “Regulatory Filings”),\nwhich involved an incorrect classification of the Company’s subordinated notes as Tier 1 capital. This incorrect classification affected the\nCompany's regulatory capital disclosures in certain prior period filings with the SEC, as those disclosures were sourced from the Regulatory\nFilings. The Company evaluated the effects of the incorrect classification to its previously filed Regulatory Filings and previously issued financial\nstatements in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins No. 99 and No. 108 and, based upon qualitative and quantitative factors,\ndetermined the errors were not material to the previously filed Regulatory Filings or the previously issued financial statements and disclosures\nincluded in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, or for any of the quarterly reports\nincluded therein or through our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024. The Company has amended its\nRegulatory Filings for the periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to reclassify the subordinated notes balance from Tier 1 capital\ninto Tier 2 capital. The correction of the classification had no effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures\nor the amounts or disclosure of the regulatory capital ratios of the Bank as included in its call reports. The Company continues to exceed\nregulatory proxy ratios to be considered “well capitalized”, plus the capital conservation buffer, at September 30, 2024.\nNature of Business and Basis of Reporting\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Horizon Bancorp, Inc. (“Horizon” or the\n“Company”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Horizon Bank (“Horizon Bank” or the “Bank”), which is an Indiana commercial bank. All\ninter–company balances and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations for the periods ended September 30, 2024 and\nSeptember 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year of 2024 or 2023. The accompanying unaudited\ncondensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of Horizon’s management, necessary to fairly present\nthe financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Horizon for the periods presented. Those adjustments consist only of normal\nrecurring adjustments.\nCertain information and note disclosures normally included in Horizon’s annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Horizon’s Annual\nReport on Form 10–K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2024 (the\n“2023 Annual Report on Form 10–K”). The condensed consolidated balance sheet of Horizon as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from\nthe audited balance sheet as of that date.\nOn July 16, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a stock repurchase program for up to 2,250,000 shares of Horizon’s issued\nand outstanding common stock, no par value. As of September 30, 2024, Horizon had repurchased a total of 803,349 shares at an average price\nper share of $16.89.\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders (net income less dividend requirements for\npreferred stock and accretion of preferred stock discount) by the weighted–average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per\nshare reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into\ncommon stock.\n9\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

As of\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 2,338 and 2,290 securities, respectively, with market values below their cost\nbasis. The total fair value of these investments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion, which is\napproximately 89.7% and 85.1%, respectively, of the Company's available for sale and held to maturity securities portfolio. These declines\nresulted primarily from fluctuations in market interest rates after purchase. Management believes the declines in fair value for these securities\nare temporary.\nNo allowance for credit losses for available for sale debt securities was recorded at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nThe allowance for credit losses for held to maturity securities is a contra asset valuation account that is deducted from the carrying amount of\nheld to maturity securities to present the net amount expected to be collected. Held to maturity securities are charged off against the allowance\nfor credit loss when deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the allowance for credit loss are reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements\nof Income in credit loss expense. We measure expected credit losses on held to maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type\nwith each type sharing similar risk characteristics, and consider historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and\nreasonable and\n13\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nsupportable forecasts. With regard to U.S. Government-sponsored treasuries, agency and mortgage-backed securities, all these securities are\nissued by a U.S. government-sponsored entity and have an implicit or explicit government guarantee; therefore, no allowance for credit losses\nhas been recorded for these securities. With regard to obligations of states and municipal, private label mortgage-backed and corporate note\nheld to maturity securities, we consider (1) issuer bond ratings, (2) historical loss rates for given bond ratings, (3) the financial condition of the\nissuer, and (4) whether issuers continue to make timely principal and interest payments under the contractual terms of the securities. Historical\nloss rates associated with securities having similar grades as those in our portfolio have been insignificant. As of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023, there were no past due principal and interest payments associated with these securities. An allowance for credit loss of\n$158,000 and $157,000 was recorded on these securities based on applying the long-term historical rating agency credit loss rate for similarly\nrated securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company refreshes the credit quality indicator of each held-to-maturity security. The Company applies ratings derived\nfrom Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\"NRSRO\"), specifically Moody's and Standard & Poor's. For state and municipal\nsecurities where no rating is available from the NRSROs, a consistent internally-assigned rating methodology is applied. The amortized cost of\nthese securities in the following tables subject to this methodology totaled $132.5 million as of September 30, 2024, and $143.7 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe following table summarizes credit ratings of our held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost for the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 AAA AA A BBB BB Not Rated Total\nU.S. Treasury and federal\nagencies $ — $ 283,851 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 283,851\nState and municipal 253,333 689,162 112,192 2,182 — — 1,056,869\nFederal agency collateralized\nmortgage obligations 47,232 — — — — — 47,232\nFederal agency mortgage-\nbacked pools 308,725 — — — — — 308,725\nPrivate labeled mortgage-\nbacked pools 29,975 — — — — — 29,975\nCorporate notes — 6,184 11,620 75,765 4,546 63,770 161,885\nTotal $ 639,265 $ 979,197 $ 123,812 $ 77,947 $ 4,546 $ 63,770 $ 1,888,537\nDecember 31, 2023 AAA AA A BBB BB Not Rated Total\nU.S. Treasury and federal\nagencies $ — $ 287,259 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 287,259\nState and municipal 285,748 730,907 69,658 2,186 — — 1,088,499\nFederal agency collateralized\nmortgage obligations 51,325 — — — — — 51,325\nFederal agency mortgage-\nbacked pools 323,649 — — — — — 323,649\nPrivate labeled mortgage-\nbacked pools 32,329 — — — — — 32,329\nCorporate notes — 4,260 11,831 78,197 4,556 63,890 162,734\nTotal $ 693,051 $ 1,022,426 $ 81,489 $ 80,383 $ 4,556 $ 63,890 $ 1,945,795\n14\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

Therefore, for those securities, we do\nnot record expected credit losses.\nBased on an evaluation of available evidence, management believes the unrealized losses on available for sale state and municipal securities,\nprivate labeled mortgage–backed pools and corporate notes were due to changes in interest rates. Due to the contractual terms, the issuers of\nstate and municipal securities are not allowed to settle for less than the amortized cost of the security. In addition, the Company does not intend\nto sell these securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost, which may not occur until maturity. No allowance for credit losses was\nrecognized for available for sale debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nInformation regarding security proceeds, gross gains and gross losses, based on specific identification method, are presented below.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nSales of securities available for sale\nProceeds $ — $ — $ — $ 88,194\nGross gains — — — 215\nGross losses — — — (695)\n15\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

In evaluating the overall risk associated\nwith the loan, the Company considers character, overall financial condition and resources, and payment record of the borrower; the prospects for\nsupport from any financially responsible guarantors; and the nature and degree of protection provided by the cash flow and value of any\nunderlying collateral. However, as other sources of repayment become inadequate over time, the significance of the collateral's value increases\nand the loan may become collateral dependent.\nThe tables below present the amortized cost basis and allowance for credit losses (“ACL”) allocated for collateral dependent loans in accordance\nwith ASC 326, which are individually evaluated to determine expected credit losses, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n23\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad a recorded net investment of $0.6 million of consumer mortgage loans in which foreclosure proceedings have commenced.\nCredit Quality Indicators\nHorizon Bank’s processes for determining credit quality differ slightly depending on whether a new loan or a renewed loan is being underwritten,\nor whether an existing loan is being re–evaluated for credit quality. The latter usually occurs upon receipt of current financial information or other\npertinent data that would trigger a change in the credit quality grade.\n• For new and renewed commercial loans, the Bank’s Credit Department, which acts independently of the loan officer, assigns the credit\nquality grade to the loan. Loan grades for loans with an aggregate credit exposure that exceeds the authorities in the respective regions\n(ranging from $3,000,000 to $6,000,000) are validated by the Loan Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Commercial Banking\nOfficer (“CCBO”).\n• Commercial loan officers are responsible for reviewing their loan portfolios and promptly assessing any adverse change in credit quality\nand revising the risk rating appropriately. When circumstances warrant a change in the credit quality grade, loan officers are required to\nnotify the Credit Department of the change in the credit quality grade. Downgrades are accepted immediately, however, lenders must\npresent their factual information to the Credit Department when recommending an upgrade. Downgrades to impaired status require the\nconcurrence of the CCBO and the Senior Workout Loan Manager.\n• The CCBO, or a designee, meets periodically with loan officers to discuss the status of past due loans and\n24\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nclassified loans. These meetings are also designed to give the loan officers an opportunity to identify an existing loan that should be\ndowngraded to a classified grade.\n• Monthly, senior management meets as members of the Watch Committee, which reviews all of the past due, classified, and impaired\nloans and the relative trends of these assets. This committee also reviews the actions taken by management regarding foreclosure\nmitigation, loan extensions, loan modifications, other real estate owned and personal property repossessions. The information reviewed\nin this meeting acts as a precursor for developing management’s analysis of the adequacy of the Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans\nand Leases.\nFor residential real estate and consumer loans, Horizon uses a grading system based on delinquency. Loans that are 90 days or more past due,\non non–accrual, or are classified as modified loans are graded “Substandard.” After being 90 to 120 days delinquent a loan is charged off unless\nit is well secured and in the process of collection. If the latter case exists, the loan is placed on non–accrual. Occasionally a mortgage loan may\nbe graded as “Special Mention.” When this situation arises, it is because the characteristics of the loan and the borrower fit the definition of a\nRisk Grade 5 described below, which is normally used for grading commercial loans. Loans not graded Substandard are considered Pass.\nHorizon Bank employs a nine–grade rating system to determine the credit quality of commercial loans. The first five grades represent acceptable\nquality, and the last four grades mirror the criticized and classified grades used by the bank regulatory agencies (special mention, substandard,\ndoubtful, and loss). The loan grade definitions are detailed below.\nRisk Grade 1: Excellent (Pass)\nLoans secured by liquid collateral, such as certificates of deposit, reputable bank letters of credit, or other cash equivalents or loans to any\npublicly held company with a current long–term debt rating of A or better and meeting defined key financial metric ranges.\nRisk Grade 2: Good (Pass)\nLoans to businesses that have strong financial statements containing an unqualified opinion from a CPA firm and at least three years\nconsecutive years of profits; loans supported by unaudited financial statements containing strong balance sheets, five consecutive years\nof profits, a five year satisfactory relationship with the Bank, and key balance sheet and income statement trends that are either stable or\npositive; loans secured by publicly traded marketable securities with required margins where there is no impediment to liquidation; loans to\nindividuals backed by liquid personal assets and unblemished credit histories; or loans to publicly held companies with current long–term\ndebt ratings of Baa or better and meeting defined key financial metric ranges.\nRisk Grade 3: Satisfactory (Pass)\nLoans supported by financial statements (audited or unaudited) that indicate average or slightly below average risk and having some\ndeficiency or vulnerability to changing economic conditions; loans with some weakness but offsetting features of other support are readily\navailable; loans that are meeting the terms of repayment, but which may be susceptible to deterioration if adverse factors are encountered\nand meeting defined key financial metric ranges. Loans may be graded Satisfactory when there is no recent information on which to base\na current risk evaluation and the following conditions apply:\n• At inception, the loan was properly underwritten, did not possess an unwarranted level of credit risk, and the loan met the above\ncriteria for a risk grade of Excellent, Good, or Satisfactory;\n• At inception, the loan was secured with collateral possessing a loan value adequate to protect the Bank from loss.\n• The loan has exhibited two or more years of satisfactory repayment with a reasonable reduction of the principal balance.\n• During the period that the loan has been outstanding, there has been no evidence of any credit weakness. Some examples of\nweakness include slow payment, lack of cooperation by the borrower, breach of loan covenants, or the borrower is in an industry\nknown to be experiencing problems. If any of these credit weaknesses is observed, a lower risk grade may be warranted.\nRisk Grade 4: Satisfactory/Monitored (Pass)\n25\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nLoans in this category are considered to be of acceptable credit quality, but contain greater credit risk than Satisfactory rated loans and\nmeet defined key financial metric ranges. Borrower displays acceptable liquidity, leverage, and earnings performance within the Bank’s\nminimum underwriting guidelines. The level of risk is acceptable but conditioned on the proper level of loan officer supervision. Loans that\nnormally fall into this grade include acquisition, construction and development loans and income producing properties that have not\nreached stabilization.\nRisk Grade 4W: Management Watch (Pass)\nLoans in this category are considered to be of acceptable quality and meet defined key financial metric ranges, but with above normal risk.\nBorrower displays potential indicators of weakness in the primary source of repayment resulting in a higher reliance on secondary sources\nof repayment. Balance sheet may exhibit weak liquidity and/or high leverage. There is inconsistent earnings performance without the\nability to sustain adverse economic conditions. Borrower may be operating in a declining industry or the property type, as for a commercial\nreal estate loan, may be high risk or in decline. These loans require an increased level of loan officer supervision and monitoring to assure\nthat any deterioration is addressed in a timely fashion. Commercial construction loans are graded as 4W Management Watch until the\nprojects are completed and stabilized.\nRisk Grade 5: Special Mention\nLoans which possess some temporary (normally less than one year) credit deficiency or potential weakness which deserves close\nattention. Such loans pose an unwarranted financial risk that, if not corrected, could weaken the loan by adversely impacting the future\nrepayment ability of the borrower. The key distinctions of a Special Mention classification are that (1) it is indicative of an unwarranted level\nof risk and (2) weaknesses are considered “potential,” not “defined,” impairments to the primary source of repayment. These loans may be\nto borrowers with adverse trends in financial performance, collateral value and/or marketability, or balance sheet strength and must meet\ndefined key financial metric ranges.\nRisk Grade 6: Substandard\nOne or more of the following characteristics may be exhibited in loans classified Substandard:\n• Loans which possess a defined credit weakness. The likelihood that a loan will be paid from the primary source of repayment is\nuncertain. Financial deterioration is under way and very close attention is warranted to ensure that the loan is collected without\nloss.\n• Loans are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor.\n• The primary source of repayment is gone, and the Bank is forced to rely on a secondary source of repayment, such as collateral\nliquidation or guarantees.\n• Loans have a distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.\n• Unusual courses of action are needed to maintain a high probability of repayment.\n• The borrower is not generating enough cash flow to repay loan principal; however, it continues to make interest payments.\n• The lender is forced into a subordinated or unsecured position due to flaws in documentation.\n• Loans have been restructured so that payment schedules, terms, and collateral represent concessions to the borrower when\ncompared to the normal loan terms.\n• The lender is seriously contemplating foreclosure or legal action due to the apparent deterioration in the loan.\n• There is a significant deterioration in market conditions to which the borrower is highly vulnerable.\n• The borrower meets defined key financial metric ranges.\nRisk Grade 7: Doubtful\nOne or more of the following characteristics may be present in loans classified Doubtful:\n• Loans have all of the weaknesses of those classified as Substandard. However, based on existing conditions, these weaknesses\nmake full collection of principal highly improbable.\n26\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accrued interest on our loan portfolio\nwas $18.2 million and $23.7 million, respectively.\nThe Company utilized the Cumulative Loss Rate method in determining expected future credit losses. The loss rate method measures the\namount of loan charge–offs, net of recoveries, (“loan losses”) recognized over the life of a closed pool and compares those loan losses to the\noutstanding loan balance of that pool as of a specific point in time (“pool date”).\n32\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nTo estimate a CECL loss rate for the pool, management first identifies the loan losses recognized between the pool date and the reporting date\nfor the pool and determines which loan losses were related to loans outstanding at the pool date. The loss rate method then divides the loan\nlosses recognized on loans outstanding as of the pool date by the outstanding loan balance as of the pool date.\nThe Company’s expected loss estimate is anchored in historical credit loss experience, with an emphasis on all available portfolio data. The\nCompany’s historical look–back period includes January 2009 through the current period, on a monthly basis. When historical credit loss\nexperience is not sufficient for a specific portfolio, the Company may supplement its own portfolio data with external models or data. The\nCompany supplemented data for 2009 and 2010 with the use of adjusted Uniform Bank Performance Report peer group data.\nQualitative reserves reflect management’s overall estimate of the extent to which current expected credit losses on collectively evaluated loans\nwill differ from historical loss experience. The analysis takes into consideration other analytics performed within the organization, such as\nenterprise and concentration management, along with other credit–related analytics as deemed appropriate. Management attempts to quantify\nqualitative reserves whenever possible.\nThe Company’s CECL estimate applies to a forecast that incorporates macroeconomic trends and other environmental factors. Management\nutilized Moody's economic forecast scenarios including both National and Regional econometrics, as well as management judgment, as the\nbasis for the forecast period. The historical loss rate was utilized as the base rate, and qualitative adjustments were utilized to reflect the forecast\nand other relevant factors.\nThe Company segments the loan portfolio into pools based on the following risk characteristics: financial asset type, loan purpose, collateral\ntype, loan characteristics, credit characteristics, outstanding loan balances, contractual terms and prepayment assumptions, industry of the\nborrower and concentrations, and historical or expected credit loss patterns.\nLiability for Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit\nThe following tables represent, by loan portfolio segment, a summary of changes in the activity in the liability for commitments to extend credit\nand standby letters of credit (please see note 14):\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance, Balance, Credit loss\nbeginning of Credit loss Ending beginning of expense\nperiod expense (reversal) balance period (reversal) Ending balance\nCommercial $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nReal Estate 41 — 41 61 (8) 53\nMortgage Warehouse — — — — — —\nConsumer 664 — 664 928 (249) 679\nTotal $ 705 $ — $ 705 $ 989 $ (257) $ 732\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nBalance, Balance, Credit loss\nbeginning of Credit loss Ending beginning of expense\nperiod expense (reversal) balance period (reversal) Ending balance\nCommercial $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nReal Estate 64 (23) 41 161 (108) 53\nMortgage Warehouse — — — — — —\nConsumer 551 113 664 242 437 679\nTotal $ 615 $ 90 $ 705 $ 403 $ 329 $ 732\nNote 5 – Loan Servicing\n33\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

Mortgage servicing rights are included in other assets on the balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nMortgage servicing rights\nBalance, beginning of period $ 18,432 $ 18,507 $ 18,807 $ 18,619\nServicing rights capitalized 398 428 956 863\nAmortization of servicing rights (502) (285) (1,435) (832)\nBalance, end of period 18,328 18,650 18,328 18,650\nImpairment allowance\nBalance, beginning of period — — — —\nAdditions — — — —\nReductions — — — —\nBalance, end of period — — — —\nMortgage servicing rights, net $ 18,328 $ 18,650 $ 18,328 $ 18,650\nFair value, beginning of period $ 19,091 $ 19,659 $ 19,891 $ 18,619\nFair value, end of period 18,449 19,571 18,449 19,571\nNote 6 – Goodwill\nThe carrying amount of goodwill was $155.2 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were no changes in\nthe carrying amount of goodwill for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Goodwill is assessed for impairment\nannually, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for\nimpairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting\nunit is less than its estimated carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is\nperformed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.\nNo goodwill impairment charges were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. During the third quarter of\n2024, Horizon considered the amount by which fair value exceeded book value by performing a qualitative analysis. The Company engaged a\nthird-party valuation specialist in performing its quantitative impairment analysis during the third quarter of 2023, which included a combination of\nvaluation approaches to determine the fair value of the Bank reporting unit. These valuation approaches required certain assumptions such as\nthe discount rate, economic conditions impacting interest and growth rates, the control premium, and a relative weighting given to the fair value\nderived by each of the valuation approaches used and supported that the fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value. At the conclusion of\nthe quantitative analysis for the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined that as of September 30, 2023, it was more likely than not that\nthe fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value.\nNote 7 – Repurchase Agreements\nThe Company transfers various securities to customers in exchange for cash at the end of each business day and agrees to\n34\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

The Notes mature on July 1, 2030 (the\n“Maturity Date”). From and including the date of original issuance to, but excluding, July 1, 2025 or the date of earlier redemption (the “fixed rate\nperiod”), the Notes bear interest at an initial rate of 5.625% per annum, payable semi–annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year,\ncommencing on January 1, 2021. The last interest payment date for the fixed rate period will be July 1, 2025. From and including July 1, 2025 to,\nbut excluding, the Maturity Date or the date of earlier redemption (the “floating rate period”), the Notes bear interest at a floating rate per annum\nequal to the benchmark rate, which is expected to be Three–Month Term SOFR (the “Benchmark Rate”), plus 549 basis points, payable\nquarterly in arrears on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year, commencing on October 1, 2025. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in\nthe event that the Benchmark Rate is less than zero, the Benchmark Rate shall be deemed to be zero.\n35\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nHorizon may, at its option, beginning with the interest payment date of July 1, 2025 and on any interest payment date thereafter, redeem the\nNotes, in whole or in part. The Notes will not otherwise be redeemable by Horizon prior to maturity, unless certain events occur. The redemption\nprice for any redemption is 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of\nredemption. Any early redemption of the Notes will be subject to the receipt of the approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem to the extent then required under applicable laws or regulations, including capital regulations.\nThe Notes are unsecured subordinated obligations, and rank pari passu, or equally, with all of Horizon's future unsecured subordinated debt and\nare junior to all existing and future senior debt. The Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of Horizon's\nsubsidiaries, including the deposit liabilities and claims of other creditors of Horizon Bank, and are effectively subordinated to Horizon’s existing\nand future secured indebtedness. There is no sinking fund for the Notes. The Notes are obligations of Horizon only and are not obligations of,\nand are not guaranteed by, any of Horizon’s subsidiaries.\nOn December 8, 2023, Horizon cancelled $3.5 million of the $60.0 million in Notes at a price of 89.5 recording a gain of $368,000. The balance\nnet of unamortized issuance costs of the Notes was $55.7 million and $55.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively.\nNote 9 – Derivative Financial Instruments\nOur hedging policy allows the use of interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk or hedge specified assets\nand liabilities. All derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value and are recorded in other assets or other\nliabilities, as appropriate.\nCash Flow Hedges\nAs a strategy to maintain acceptable levels of exposure to the risk of changes in future cash flow due to interest rate fluctuations, the Company\nentered into an interest rate swap agreement for a portion of its floating rate debt on July 20, 2018. The agreement provides for the Company to\nreceive interest from the counterparty at one month LIBOR and to pay interest to the counterparty at a fixed rate of 2.81% on a notional amount\nof $50.0 million. Under the agreement, the Company paid or received the net interest amount monthly, with the monthly settlements included in\ninterest expense. The Company terminated this interest rate swap agreement on May 23, 2023 and recorded a related gain of $1.5 million as a\nreduction of interest expense.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is\nreported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged\ntransaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from\nthe assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.\nFair Value Hedges\nFair value hedges are intended to reduce the interest rate risk associated with the underlying hedged item. The Company enters into fixed rate\nloan agreements as part of its lending policy. To mitigate the risk of changes in fair value based on fluctuations in interest rates, the Company\nhas entered into interest rate swap agreements on individual loans, converting the fixed rate loans to a variable rate. Additionally, the Company\nentered into fair value hedges for certain of our fixed rate AFS municipal securities. The instruments are designated as fair value hedges as the\nchanges in the fair value of the interest rate swap are expected to offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to changes in\nthe SOFR swap rate, the designated benchmark interest rate. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge,\nthe gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in\ncurrent earnings. The change in fair value of both the hedge instruments and the underlying hedged item are recorded as gains or losses in\nnon–interest income. At September 30, 2024, the Company’s fair value hedges were effective and are not expected to have a significant impact\non the Company’s net income over the next 12 months.\n36\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nOther Derivative Instruments\nFrom time to time, we may enter into certain interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments. These interest rate derivative\ncontracts relate to transactions in which we enter into an interest rate swap with a customer while concurrently entering into an offsetting interest\nrate swap with a third-party financial institution. We agree to pay interest to the customer on a notional amount at a variable rate and receive\ninterest from the customer on a similar notional amount at a fixed interest rate. At the same time, we agree to pay a third-party financial\ninstitution the same fixed interest rate on the same notional amount and receive the same variable interest rate on the same notional amount.\nThese interest rate derivative contracts allow our customers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate loan.\nThe Company enters into non–hedging derivatives in the form of mortgage loan forward sale commitments with investors and commitments to\noriginate mortgage loans as part of its mortgage banking business. At September 30, 2024, the Company’s fair value of these derivatives were\nrecorded and over the next 12 months are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s net income.\nThe change in fair value of both the forward sale commitments and commitments to originate mortgage loans were recorded and the net gains or\nlosses included in the Company’s gain on sale of loans.\nThe following tables summarize the fair value of our derivative financial instruments utilized by Horizon on a gross basis for the periods\nindicated.\nAsset Derivatives Liability Derivatives\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2024\nNotional Fair Notional Fair\nAmount Value Amount Value\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts – fair value hedges $ 40,113 $ 1,797 $ 1,445 $ 4\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging instruments 40,113 1,797 1,445 4\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts – customer accommodation 524,919 15,427 524,919 15,427\nMortgage loan contracts — — 14,794 8\nCommitments to originate mortgage loans 15,549 451 — —\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 540,468 15,878 539,713 15,435\nTotal derivatives $ 580,581 $ 17,675 $ 541,158 $ 15,439\nTotal derivatives subject to enforceable master netting arrangements,\ngross $ 580,581 $ 17,675 $ 541,158 $ 15,439\nLess: Gross amounts offset — — — —\nTotal derivatives subject to enforceable master netting arrangements,\nnet $ 580,581 $ 17,675 $ 541,158 $ 15,439\n37\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 –Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\nLevel 2 –Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the\nassets or liabilities\nLevel 3 –Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis and recognized in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation\nhierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the period ended September 30, 2024. For assets\nclassified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below.\nAvailable for sale securities\nWhen quoted market prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market\nprices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows. Level 2 securities include U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, state and municipal securities, federal agency\ncollateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage–backed pools and corporate notes. Level 2 securities are valued by a third party pricing\nservice commonly used in the banking industry utilizing observable inputs. Observable inputs include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flow\nanalysis, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment spreads and available credit information and the\nbond’s terms and conditions. The pricing provider utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary based on asset class. These models incorporate\navailable market information including quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and, because many fixed–income securities do not\ntrade on a daily basis, apply available information through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector\ngrouping, and matrix pricing. In addition, model processes, such as an option adjusted spread model, is used to develop prepayment and\ninterest rate scenarios for securities with prepayment features.\nInterest rate swap agreements\nThe fair value of the Company’s interest rate swap agreements is estimated by a third party using inputs that are primarily unobservable\nincluding a yield curve, adjusted for liquidity and credit risk, contracted terms and discounted cash flow analysis, and therefore, are classified\nwithin Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\n40\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

Where market quotations were not available, considerable management\njudgment was involved in the determination of estimated fair values. Therefore, the estimated fair value of financial instruments shown below\nmay not be representative of the amounts at which they could be exchanged in a current or future transaction. Due to the inherent uncertainties\nof expected cash flows of financial instruments, the use of alternate valuation assumptions and methods could have a significant effect on the\nestimated fair value amounts.\n42\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nThe estimated fair values of financial instruments, as shown below, are not intended to reflect the estimated liquidation or market value of\nHorizon taken as a whole. The disclosed fair value estimates are limited to Horizon’s significant financial instruments at September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023. These include financial instruments recognized as assets and liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as\nwell as certain off–balance sheet financial instruments. The estimated fair values shown below do not include any valuation of assets and\nliabilities, which are not financial instruments as defined by the FASB ASC fair value hierarchy.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:\nCash and Cash Equivalents – Cash and cash equivalents are composed of: cash and due from banks, interest earning deposits, and federal\nfunds sold. The carrying amounts approximate fair value.\nInterest-Earning Time Deposits – The carrying amounts approximate fair value.\nHeld–to–Maturity Securities – For debt securities held to maturity, fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. For those\nsecurities where a quoted market price is not available, carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value based upon comparison with\nsimilar securities.\nLoans Held for Sale – The carrying amounts approximate fair value.\nNet Loans – The fair value of net loans are estimated on an exit price basis incorporating discounts for credit, liquidity and marketability factors.\nFHLB Stock – Fair value of FHLB stock is based on the price at which it may be resold to the FHLB.\nInterest Payable – The carrying amounts approximate fair value.\nDeposits – The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts, interest bearing checking accounts and money market deposits is the amount\npayable on demand at the reporting date and are classified within Level 1. The fair value of fixed maturity certificates of deposit is estimated by\ndiscounting the future cash flows using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturity and are classified within Level 2.\nBorrowings – Rates currently available to Horizon for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate fair values of\nexisting borrowings.\nSubordinated Notes – The fair value of subordinated notes is based on discounted cash flows based on current borrowing rates for similar\ntypes of instruments.\nJunior Subordinated Debentures Issued to Capital Trusts – Rates currently available for debentures with similar terms and remaining\nmaturities are used to estimate fair values of existing debentures.\nCommitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit – The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged\nto enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the\ncounterparties. For fixed–rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the\ncommitted rates.

These capital\nrequirements implement changes arising from the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the U.S. Basel Committee\non Banking Supervision’s capital framework (known as “Basel III”). Failure to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirements can initiate\ncertain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators, which if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the\nCompany’s financial statements. Under capital\n45\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nadequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective actions, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines\ninvolving quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off–balance–sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting\npractices. The Company’s and Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about\ncomponents, risk weightings and other factors.\nThe Company and Bank are subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements as defined and calculated in accordance with the Basel III–\nbased regulations. As allowed under Basel III rules, the Company made the decision to opt–out of including accumulated other comprehensive\nincome in regulatory capital. The minimum regulatory capital requirements are set forth in the table below.\nIn addition, to be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and Bank must maintain Total risk–based, Tier I risk–based, common equity Tier I\nrisk–based and Tier I leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company and Bank\nmet all capital adequacy requirements to be considered well capitalized. There have been no conditions or events since the end of the third\nquarter of 2024 that management believes have changed the Bank’s classification as well capitalized. There is no threshold for well capitalized\nstatus for bank holding companies.\n46\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

Horizon Bancorp, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:23-cv-02961 (”Securities\nAction”) was filed against the Company and two of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The Securities Action\nasserts claims under §§ 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 alleging, among other things, the Company made materially\nfalse and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts which allegedly resulted in harm to a putative class of purchasers\nof our securities from March 9, 2022 and March 10, 2023.\nAs of (1) August 28, 2023, a lawsuit related to the Securities Action was filed by Sally Hundley, derivatively on behalf of the Company, against\nthe Company, as nominal defendant, and 2 of the Company's officers and 10 of its directors and (2) August 31, 2023, a lawsuit also related to\nthe Securities Action was filed by Aziz Chowdhury, derivatively on behalf of the Company, against the Company, as nominal defendant, and 2 of\nthe Company's officers and 10 of its directors (the “Derivatives Actions”) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The\nDerivative Actions allege, among other things, breach of the officers and directors' fiduciary duties. The Derivative Actions have been\nconsolidated and stayed pending resolution of any motion to dismiss in the Securities Action.\nBased on our initial review of these actions, management believes that the Company has strong defenses to the claims and intends to vigorously\ndefend against them. As of September 30, 2024, no liabilities related to the above matters were recorded because we have concluded such\nliabilities are not probable and the amounts of such liabilities are not reasonably estimable.\nIn addition to the matters described above, from time to time, Horizon and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings incidental to\nthe conduct of their business. Management does not expect that the outcome of any such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our\nconsolidated financial position or results of operations.\nFinancial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its\nclients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying\ndegrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets.\nCommitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a client, so long as there is no violation of any condition established in\nthe commitment contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do\nnot necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nStandby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. The credit\nrisk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to clients. The Company’s\npolicy for obtaining collateral, and determining the nature of such collateral, is essentially the same as in the Company’s policies for making\ncommitments to extend credit. The methodology for estimating the liability for unfunded loan commitments is consistent with the allowance for\ncredit losses on loans.\nThe following table represents the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommitments to extend credit 1,025,186 1,118,417\nStandby letters of credit 24,378 16,493\nTotal $ 1,049,564 1,134,910\nNote 15 - Subsequent Events\nIn October, the Company sold certain available-for-sale securities with a total fair market value of $293.1 million, and an amortized cost of\n$332.2 million. As a result, the Company incurred a net realized loss on sale of securities of $39.1 million.\n48\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\n(Table Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Data)\nAdditionally, in October, the Company has signed a letter of intent to sell its mortgage warehouse business, which is expected to generate a\ngain-on-sale.\n49\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

(“Horizon” or the “Company”) and\nHorizon Bank (the “Bank”). Horizon intends such forward–looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward–looking\nstatements contained in the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for the purposes of these safe harbor\nprovisions. Statements in this report should be considered in conjunction with the other information available about Horizon, including the\ninformation in the other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward–looking statements are based on\nmanagement’s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such\nstatements by using words such as “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “could,” “will” and similar expressions in\nconnection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in\nsuch forward–looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.\nActual results may differ materially, adversely or positively, from the expectations of the Company that are expressed or implied by any forward–\nlooking statement. Risks, uncertainties, and factors that could cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or\nimplied by any forward–looking statement include but are not limited to:\n• current financial conditions within the banking industry;\n• changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, spreads on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, and interest rate sensitivity;\n• the aggregate effects of elevated inflation levels in recent years;\n• loss of key Horizon personnel;\n• macroeconomic conditions and their impact on Horizon and its customers;\n• the increasing use of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies and/or stable coin and the possible impact these alternative currencies may\nhave on deposit disintermediation and income derived from payment systems;\n• the effect of interest rates on net interest rate margin and their impact on mortgage loan volumes and the outflow of deposits;\n• increases in disintermediation, as new technologies allow consumers to complete financial transactions without the assistance of banks;\n• potential loss of fee income, including interchange fees, as new and emerging alternative payment platforms (e.g., Apple Pay or Bitcoin)\ntake a greater market share of the payment systems;\n• estimates of fair value of certain of Horizon’s assets and liabilities;\n• volatility and disruption in financial markets;\n• changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses and market values, collateral securing loans and other assets;\n• changes in sources of liquidity;\n• potential risk of environmental liability related to lending and acquisition activities;\n• changes in the competitive environment in Horizon’s market areas and among other financial service providers;\n• legislation and/or regulation affecting the financial services industry as a whole, and Horizon and its subsidiaries in particular;\n• changes in regulatory supervision and oversight, including monetary policy and capital requirements;\n• changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be adopted and required by regulatory agencies;\n50\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

We do\nnot undertake to update any forward–looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by us or on our behalf. For\na detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to differ materially from the results or\nperformance expressed or implied by forward–looking statements, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Annual Report on Form\n10–K, in Item 1A of Part II of this Quarterly Report on Form 10–Q, and in the subsequent reports we file with the SEC.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10–K contain a summary of\nthe Company’s significant accounting policies. Certain of these policies are important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition, since\nthey require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain.\nThe Company considers these policies to be its critical accounting estimates. Management has identified as critical accounting policies the\nallowance for credit losses, goodwill and intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, hedge accounting and valuation measurements.\nFor additional information regarding critical accounting estimates, see Note 1 – Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies included in Item 8 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no material\nchanges in the Company’s application of critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nNet Income\nNet income increased $2.0 million to $18.2 million, or $0.42 per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to\n$16.2 million, or $0.37 per share, for the same period in 2023. The increase from the year ago period was primarily driven by an increase in net\ninterest income and a reduction in the effective tax rate in the current period, partially offset by an increase in non-interest expense when\ncompared to the year ago period. Net interest income\n51\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition\nAnd Results of Operations\nFor the Three and Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023\nincreased by $4.8 million, or 11.5% when compared with the year ago period, driven by a modest increase in average earning assets and a 25\nbasis point increase in the net FTE interest margin1, to 2.66% in the current period.\nNet income declined $6.9 million to $46.3 million, or $1.06 per share, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to\n$53.2 million, or $1.22 per share, for the same period in 2023. The decrease from the year ago period was primarily a result of growth in non-\ninterest expense, a decline in non-interest income and increased provision for loan loss related to loan growth in the current period.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $4.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to $46.9 million, when compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. While average earning asset growth was modest, the reported net FTE interest margin1 increased by 25 basis points, to 2.66%\nfor the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period, attributable to the favorable mix shift in both average interest\nearning assets toward higher-yielding loans and the funding mix toward lower cost deposit liabilities, in addition to a higher contribution to the net\nFTE interest margin1 from interest-free funds. Interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans did not contribute significantly to the third\nquarter net interest income, or net FTE interest margin1.\n1Non-GAAP financial metric.

Growth in average earning asset balances and a 1 basis point increase in the reported net FTE interest margin2, to 2.60% for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the year ago period drove the net interest income growth versus the year ago comparable\nperiod. The net FTE interest margin expansion over the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was modest, as the increased contribution from\ninterest-free funds was largely offset by the contraction in the net spread between the yield on earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\n2 Non-GAAP financial metric.

At September 30, 2024, in addition to liquidity available from the normal operating, funding, and\ninvesting activities of Horizon, the Bank had approximately $1.52 billion in unused credit lines with various money center banks, including the\nFHLB and the FRB Discount Window compared to $1.41 billion at December 31, 2023.\nThe cash flows from the operating, investing and financing activities of the Company resulted in a net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and\nrestricted cash of $291.7 million during the first nine months of 2024, as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report.\nOperating activities, consisting mainly of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, provided cash flow of $54.7 million and have historically\nbeen a stable source of funds. Investing activities, which occur mainly in the loan and investment securities portfolios, used cash of $322.4\nmillion mainly due to growth in the loan portfolio, which used cash of $413.4 million. Financing activities used cash of $24.0 million, largely\nresulting from the repayment of long-term borrowings of $563.1 million and $21.3 million in dividends paid on common stock during the first nine\nmonths of 2024.\nCapital Resources\nThe capital resources of Horizon and the Bank exceeded regulatory capital ratios for “well capitalized” banks at September 30, 2024.\nStockholders’ equity totaled $754.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $718.8 million as of December 31, 2023. For the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, the ratio of average stockholders’ equity to average assets was 9.30% compared to 8.97% for the twelve months\nended December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders’ equity during the period was due to net income generated during the period and the\nimproved market value of securities available for sale, offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total stockholders’ equity to total assets is 9.52%. Book value per common share was $17.27, increasing\n$0.80 compared to December 31, 2023.\nTangible common equity1 totaled $588.5 million at September 30, 2024, and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 was 7.58%\nat September 30, 2024. Tangible book value, which excludes intangible assets from total equity, per common share1 was $13.46, increasing\n$0.87 compared to December 31, 2023.\nHorizon declared common stock dividends in the amount of $0.48 per share during the first nine months of 2024 and $0.48 per share for the\nsame period in 2023. The dividend payout ratio (dividends as a percent of basic earnings per share) was 45.3% and 39.3% for the first nine\nmonths of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest rate risk management focuses on monitoring and maintaining variances in the Company's net interest income profile due to changes in\ninterests rates to within Board-approved policy limits. The Company primarily uses earnings simulation models to expose net interest income to\n12- and 24- month sensitivities to various movements in rates. Simulations are modeled quarterly to include scenarios where market rates\nchange instantaneously up or down in a parallel or non-parallel manner, which account for the periodic changes in the balance sheet\ncomposition. For further discussion of the Company’s market risk, see the Interest Rate Sensitivity section of Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below shows the modelled effects of an immediate and parallel shift in interest rates on the Company's net interest income profile over\na one-year horizon versus the base case net interest income in a flat rate scenario. The simulation model assumes a static balance sheet over\nthat twelve month period, and utilizes various non-maturity interest bearing deposit beta assumptions, based on the underlying products, ranging\nfrom 12% to 80% in the disclosed model outputs below. Deposit beta is an estimate for how quickly interest-bearing deposit pricing will change\nfor a given change in interest rates. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not\nintended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results, but rather to provide insight into our current interest\nrate exposure and to assist in the execution of appropriate asset/liability management strategies. As shown below, the model output would\nindicate that as of September 30, 2024, the Company's interest-bearing liabilities are projected to reprice at a faster pace than interest-earning\nassets for the next 100 basis points of declining interest rates.\nSeptember 30, 2024\n(Dollars in millions) $ Change in Net Interest Income % Change in Net Interest Income\n200 basis points rising $ (17.7) (7.9)%\n100 basis points rising (7.9) (3.5)%\n100 basis points falling $ 2.8 1.3 %\n200 basis points falling (2.7) (1.2)%\n65\nTable of Contents\nHORIZON BANCORP, INC.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, Horizon’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial\nOfficer have evaluated the effectiveness of Horizon’s disclosure controls (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(e) of the Securities Exchange\nAct of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”)).

(“Horizon” or the “Company”), the parent company of Horizon Bank (the “Bank”), announced its unaudited financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $18.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, compared to net income of $14.1 million, or $0.32, for the second quarter of 2024 and compared to net income of $16.2 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $46.3 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to net income of $53.2 million, or $1.21, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net interest income increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to $46.9 million, compared to $45.3 million in the linked quarter of 2024. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis1, expanded for the fourth consecutive quarter to 2.66%, compared to 2.64% in the linked quarter of 2024.\n\n\n  * Total loans held for investment (\"HFI\") were $4.8 billion at September 30, 2024, relatively unchanged from June 30, 2024 balances. However, consistent with the Company's stated growth strategy, the commercial portfolio showed continued organic growth momentum during the quarter, which was offset with planned run-off of lower-yielding indirect auto loans in the consumer loan portfolio. \n\n\n  * Positive deposit growth of 1.7% during the quarter, to $5.7 billion at period end. The quarter was highlighted by stable non-interest bearing deposit balances and growth in core relationship consumer and commercial portfolios. \n\n\n  * Credit quality remains strong, with annualized net charge offs of 0.03% of average loans during the third quarter. Non-performing assets to total assets of 0.32% remains well within expected ranges, with no material change in the loss outlook. Provision for loan losses of $1.0 million reflects continued positive credit performance.\n\n\n\n“Horizon continues to execute well on its key strategic initiatives of consistently improving our operating performance through a more productive balance sheet, growth in non-interest income and continued disciplined in our operating model. As a result, we are optimistic on the positive momentum of the franchise through year-end 2024 and into 2025. During the quarter, our commercial team was able to deliver another quarter of quality loan growth, even coming off a strong end to the second quarter. The strength of Horizon's core deposit franchise showed solid performance, and our credit metrics remain well managed. These efforts led to a third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in pre-tax pre-provision income,\" President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas M. Prame said. \"Importantly, we continue our efforts to optimize our business model, and are pleased to announce the repositioning of a portion of our securities portfolio and the intended sale of our mortgage warehouse business during the fourth quarter. These shareholder accretive actions are expected to yield sustainable improvement in the profitability of our business that will be evident in the fourth quarter, and positively impact Horizon's financial performance in 2025.\"\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric. See non-GAAP reconciliation included herein for the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n\n**Accretive Fourth Quarter 2024 Strategic Actions**\n\nHorizon announced strategic actions taking place in the fourth quarter of 2024, which are designed to simplify its business, strengthen the balance sheet and improve long-term structural profitability. In October, the Company completed the repositioning of about $325 million of available-for-sale securities. Additionally, the Company has signed a letter of intent to sell its mortgage warehouse business, which is expected to generate a gain-on-sale. Details on these actions, the use of proceeds, and the expected financial impact are available in the Company's third quarter 2024 investor presentation published at [investor.horizonbank.com](http://investor.horizonbank.com).\n\n**Financial Highlights**  \n---  \n(Dollars in Thousands Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, Unaudited)  \n**Three Months Ended**  \n**September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**| **September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**Income statement:**  \nNet interest income| $| 46,910| $| 45,279| $| 43,288| $| 42,257| $| 42,090  \nCredit loss expense| 1,044| 2,369| 805| 1,274| 263  \nNon-interest income| 11,511| 10,485| 9,929| (20,449| )| 11,830  \nNon-interest expense| 39,272| 37,522| 37,107| 39,330| 36,168  \nIncome tax expense| (75| )| 1,733| 1,314| 6,419| 1,284  \nNet income| $| 18,180| $| 14,140| $| 13,991| $| (25,215| )| $| 16,205  \n**Per share data:**  \nBasic earnings per share| $| 0.42| $| 0.32| $| 0.32| $| (0.58| )| $| 0.37  \nDiluted earnings per share| 0.41| 0.32| 0.32| (0.58| )| 0.37  \nCash dividends declared per common share| 0.16| 0.16| 0.16| 0.16| 0.16  \nBook value per common share| 17.27| 16.62| 16.49| 16.47| 15.89  \nMarket value - high| 16.57| 12.74| 14.44| 14.65| 12.68  \nMarket value - low| 11.89| 11.29| 11.75| 9.33| 9.90  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - Basic| 43,712,059| 43,712,059| 43,663,610| 43,649,585| 43,646,609  \nWeighted average shares outstanding - Diluted| 44,112,321| 43,987,187| 43,874,036| 43,649,585| 43,796,069  \nCommon shares outstanding (end of period)| 43,712,059| 43,712,059| 43,726,380| 43,652,063| 43,648,501  \n**Key ratios:**  \nReturn on average assets| 0.92| %| 0.73| %| 0.72| %| (1.27) %| 0.81| %  \nReturn on average stockholders' equity| 9.80| 7.83| 7.76| (14.23| )| 8.99  \nTotal equity to total assets| 9.52| 9.18| 9.18| 9.06| 8.71  \nTotal loans to deposit ratio| 83.92| 85.70| 82.78| 78.01| 76.52  \nAllowance for credit losses to HFI loans| 1.10| 1.08| 1.09| 1.13| 1.14  \nAnnualized net charge-offs of average total loans(1)| 0.03| 0.05| 0.04| 0.07| 0.07  \nEfficiency ratio| 67.22| 67.29| 69.73| 180.35| 67.08  \n**Key metrics (Non-GAAP)****(2)****:**  \nNet FTE interest margin| 2.66| %| 2.64| %| 2.50| %| 2.43| %| 2.41| %  \nReturn on average tangible common equity| 12.65| 10.18| 10.11| (18.76| )| 11.79  \nTangible common equity to tangible assets| 7.58| 7.22| 7.20| 7.08| 6.72  \nTangible book value per common share| $| 13.46| $| 12.80| $| 12.65| $| 12.60| $| 12.00  \n(1) Average total loans includes loans held for investment and held for sale.  \n(2) Non-GAAP financial metrics.

Horizon’s net FTE interest margin1 was 2.66% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.64% for the second quarter of 2024, attributable to the favorable mix shift in average interest earning assets toward higher-yielding loans and in the average funding mix toward lower-cost deposit balances. Interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans did not contribute significantly to the third quarter net interest income, or net FTE interest margin.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.0 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $2.4 million during the second quarter of 2024, and $0.3 million during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the provision for credit losses during the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the second quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to less total loan growth in the current quarter relative to the prior quarter.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the allowance for credit losses included net charge-offs of $0.4 million, or an annualized 0.03% of average loans outstanding, compared to net charge-offs of $0.6 million, or an annualized 0.05% of average loans outstanding for the second quarter of 2024, and net charge-offs of $0.7 million, or an annualized 0.07% of average loans outstanding, in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans HFI was 1.10% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.08% at June 30, 2024 and 1.14% at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**| **September 30,**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in Thousands)_| **2024**| **2024**| **2024**| **2023**| **2023**  \n**Non-interest Income**  \nService charges on deposit accounts| $| 3,320| $| 3,130| $| 3,214| $| 3,092| $| 3,086  \nWire transfer fees| 123| 113| 101| 103| 120  \nInterchange fees| 3,511| 3,826| 3,109| 3,224| 3,186  \nFiduciary activities| 1,394| 1,372| 1,315| 1,352| 1,206  \nGains (losses) on sale of investment securities| —| —| —| (31,572| )| —  \nGain on sale of mortgage loans| 1,622| 896| 626| 951| 1,582  \nMortgage servicing income net of impairment| 412| 450| 439| 724| 631  \nIncrease in cash value of bank owned life insurance| 349| 318| 298| 658| 1,055  \nOther income| 780| 380| 827| 1,019| 964  \nTotal non-interest income| $| 11,511| $| 10,485| $| 9,929| $| (20,449| )| $| 11,830  \n  \nTotal non-interest income was $11.5 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $10.5 million in the second quarter of 2024, due primarily to higher realized gains on sale of mortgage loans and increased other income.\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric.

The increase in non-interest expense during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by a $1.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, which is partially attributable to a legacy benefits program expense, and a $0.6 million increase in outside services and consultants expense related to strategic initiatives.\n\n**Income Taxes**\n\nHorizon's effective tax rate was -0.4% for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 10.9% for the second quarter of 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate during the third quarter was primarily due to an increase in net realizable tax credits for the current year, which reduced the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nTotal assets increased by $14.9 million, or 0.2%, to $7.93 billion as of September 30, 2024, from $7.91 billion as of June 30, 2024. The increase in total assets is primarily due to increases in federal funds sold of $79.5 million, or 230.6%, to $113.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $34.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The increase in federal funds sold during the period was partially offset by a decrease in other assets of $46.6 million, or 28.1%, to $119.0 million as of September 30, 2024, from $165.7 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nTotal investment securities remained unchanged, at $2.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to June 30, 2024, as the positive market impact to available for sale securities was offset by normal pay-downs and maturities. There were no purchases of investment securities during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal loans HFI and loans held for sale were relatively consistent at $4.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 compared to $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2024, as growth in commercial loans of $9.5 million were offset by a decline in consumer loans of $43.3 million.\n\nTotal deposit balances increased by $96.9 million, or 1.7%, to $5.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 when compared to balances as of June 30, 2024. Non-interest bearing deposit balances were essentially unchanged during the quarter.\n\nTotal borrowings decreased by $86.4 million, or 7.0%, to $1.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, primarily related to the repayment of a portion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, when compared to balances as of June 30, 2024.\n\n**Capital**\n\nThe following table presents the consolidated regulatory capital ratios of the Company for the previous three quarters:\n\n**For the Quarter Ended**| **September 30,**| **June 30,**| **March 31,**| **December 31,**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n**2024***|  **2024**| **2024****|  **2023****  \n **Consolidated Capital Ratios**  \nTotal capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 13.52| %| 13.41| %| 13.75| %| 14.04| %  \nTier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 11.70| %| 11.59| %| 11.89| %| 12.13| %  \nCommon equity tier 1 capital (to risk-weighted assets)| 10.74| %| 10.63| %| 10.89| %| 11.11| %  \nTier 1 capital (to average assets)| 9.01| %| 9.02| %| 8.91| %| 8.61| %  \n*Preliminary estimate - may be subject to change  \n**Prior periods were previously revised (see disclosure in Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ending June 30, 2024)  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total stockholders’ equity to total assets is 9.52%. Book value per common share was $17.27, increasing $0.65 during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTangible common equity1 totaled $588.5 million at September 30, 2024, and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets1 was 7.58% at September 30, 2024, up from 7.22% at June 30, 2024. Tangible book value, which excludes intangible assets from total equity, per common share1 was $13.46, increasing $0.66 during the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Credit Quality**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, total non-accrual loans increased by $5.3 million, or 29.0%, from June 30, 2024, to 0.49% of total loans HFI. Total non-performing assets increased $5.1 million, or 25.0%, to $25.6 million, compared to $20.5 million as of June 30, 2024. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets increased to 0.32% compared to 0.26% as of June 30, 2024.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, net charge-offs decreased by $0.2 million to $0.4 million, compared to $0.6 million as of June 30, 2024 and remain just 0.03% annualized of average loans.\n\n_________________________1 Non-GAAP financial metric.

Specifically, we have included non-GAAP financial measures relating to net income, diluted earnings per share, pre-tax, pre-provision net income, net interest margin, tangible stockholders’ equity and tangible book value per share, efficiency ratio, the return on average assets, the return on average common equity, and return on average tangible equity. In each case, we have identified special circumstances that we consider to be non-recurring and have excluded them. We believe that this shows the impact of such events as acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments and swap termination fees, among others we have identified in our reconciliations. Horizon believes these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors and provide a greater understanding of our business and financial results without giving effect to the purchase accounting impacts and one-time costs of acquisitions and non–recurring items. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. See the tables and other information below and contained elsewhere in this press release for reconciliations of the non-GAAP information identified herein and its most comparable GAAP measures.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release may contain forward–looking statements regarding the financial performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies of Horizon Bancorp, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Horizon”). For these statements, Horizon claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in this press release should be considered in conjunction with the other information available about Horizon, including the information in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management’s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.\n\nAlthough management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include: current financial conditions within the banking industry; changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes in spreads on earning assets and changes in interest bearing liabilities; increased interest rate sensitivity; the aggregate effects of elevated inflation levels in recent years; loss of key Horizon personnel; increases in disintermediation; potential loss of fee income, including interchange fees, as new and emerging alternative payment platforms take a greater market share of the payment systems; estimates of fair value of certain of Horizon’s assets and liabilities; changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses, market values, collateral securing loans and other assets; changes in sources of liquidity; macroeconomic conditions and their impact on Horizon and its customers; legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be adopted and required by regulatory agencies; litigation, regulatory enforcement, and legal compliance risk and costs; rapid technological developments and changes; cyber terrorism and data security breaches; the rising costs of cybersecurity; the ability of the U.S. federal government to manage federal debt limits; climate change and social justice initiatives; the inability to realize cost savings or revenues or to effectively implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures; acts of terrorism, war and global conflicts, such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the Israel and Hamas conflict; and supply chain disruptions and delays. These and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Horizon’s reports (such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website ([www.sec.gov](http://www.sec.gov)). Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward–looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Horizon does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward–looking statement is made, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.\n\n**Condensed Consolidated

(NASDAQ: HBNC)\nThird Quarter Ended September 30, 2024\nOctober 24, 2024\nBeyond ordinary banking\nImportant Information\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward–looking statements regarding the financial performance, business prospects, growth and\noperating strategies of Horizon Bancorp, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, “Horizon”). For these statements, Horizon claims the\nprotection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nStatements in this press release should be considered in conjunction with the other information available about Horizon, including the\ninformation in the filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Forward-looking statements provide\ncurrent expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are\nbased on management’s expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We have tried, wherever possible, to\nidentify such statements by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will” and similar\nexpressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.\nAlthough management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may\ndiffer materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially include: current financial conditions within the banking industry; changes in the level and volatility of interest rates, changes\nin spreads on earning assets and changes in interest bearing liabilities; increased interest rate sensitivity; the aggregate effects of\nelevated inflation levels in recent years; loss of key Horizon personnel; increases in disintermediation; potential loss of fee income,\nincluding interchange fees, as new and emerging alternative payment platforms take a greater market share of the payment systems;\nestimates of fair value of certain of Horizon’s assets and liabilities; changes in prepayment speeds, loan originations, credit losses,\nmarket values, collateral securing loans and other assets; changes in sources of liquidity; macroeconomic conditions and their impact on\nHorizon and its customers; legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be\nadopted and required by regulatory agencies; litigation, regulatory enforcement, and legal compliance risk and costs; rapid\ntechnological developments and changes; cyber terrorism and data security breaches; the rising costs of cybersecurity; the ability of the\nU.S. federal government to manage federal debt limits; climate change and social justice initiatives; the inability to realize cost savings\nor revenues or to effectively implement integration plans and other consequences associated with mergers, acquisitions, and\ndivestitures; acts of terrorism, war and global conflicts, such as the Russia and Ukraine conflict and the Israel and Hamas conflict; and\nsupply chain disruptions and delays. These and additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those\nexpressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Horizon’s reports (such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly\nReports on Form 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). Undue\nreliance should not be placed on the forward–looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Horizon does not undertake,\nand specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking\nstatement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward–looking statement is made, or reflect the\noccurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.\n2\nSeasoned Management Team\nKathie A.

In each case, we have identified special\ncircumstances that we consider to be non-recurring and have excluded them. We believe that\nthis shows the impact of such events as acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments\nand swap termination fees, among others we have identified in our reconciliations. Horizon\nbelieves these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors and provide a greater\nunderstanding of our business and financial results without giving effect to the purchase\naccounting impacts and one-time costs of acquisitions and non–recurring items. These measures\nare not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies\nand should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. See\nthe tables and other information below and contained elsewhere in this presentation for\nreconciliations of the non-GAAP information identified herein and its most comparable GAAP\nmeasures.\n22\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\n23\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\n24\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\n25\nThank you\nJohn R.
