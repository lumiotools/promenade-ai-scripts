This burner will be supplied to a company in California,\" said Jim Deller, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of ClearSign. \"This customer gained familiarity with a Rogue burner installed in a rental boiler supplied by the parent company of Rogue Combustion, California Boiler, and proceeded to place the order for a new Rogue burner for their long-term solution. We believe this sale illustrates the value of the rental program of our partner, California Boiler, which can provide, in addition to a solution to meet the customer's immediate needs, a firsthand experience of a Rogue burner's capabilities while they pursue a longer term solution.\" \n\nThis purchase order came from Rogue Combustion after the company utilized a rental boiler with a ClearSign-Rogue burner. This boiler burner is expected to be fabricated and shipped in the second quarter of 2025 to be installed at the customer's site in the San Joaquin Valley of California. \n\n**About ClearSign Technologies Corporation**\n\nClearSign Technologies Corporation designs and develops products and technologies for the purpose of decarbonization and improving key performance characteristics of industrial and commercial systems, including operational performance, energy efficiency, emission reduction, safety, the use of hydrogen as a fuel and overall cost-effectiveness.
