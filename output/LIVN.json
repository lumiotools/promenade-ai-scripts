Together with its safety endpoints, the RCT achieved statistical significance of its primary endpoint responder rates1,2 between the treatment arm and the sham arm for the LivaNova aura6000™ System. The aura6000 is an implantable hypoglossal neurostimulator intended to treat adult patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).\n\nIn the OSPREY study, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) reductions are analyzed as part of the study’s secondary endpoints. Comparing median values from baseline to six months with therapy (assessed at the seven-month follow-up visit), OSPREY subjects in the device stimulation group experienced significant reductions in these endpoints as follows:\n\n  * AHI reduced by 66.2% when the median at baseline of 34.3 is compared to the median of 11.6 at six months.\n  * ODI reduced by 63.3% when the median at baseline of 34.9 is compared to the median of 12.8 at six months.\n\n\n\nOnce the six-month results analysis is completed, LivaNova will submit the OSPREY clinical data to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of its premarket approval submission for the aura6000 System.\n\n“The study results reinforce our belief that targeted hypoglossal nerve stimulation provides a compelling alternative for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. The significant reductions in AHI and ODI achieved after only six months of therapy gives us strong evidence of this technology’s potential at 12 months and beyond,” said Vladimir Makatsaria, Chief Executive Officer of LivaNova. “I would like to thank the patients and physicians who have participated in OSPREY to date. We look forward to evaluating the full results as patients complete 12 months of therapy.”\n\nBeyond the primary endpoints, the OSPREY trial will continue to collect long-term data. After all subjects have completed 12 months with therapy (assessed at the 13-month follow-up visit), LivaNova expects the data to be available in the first half of 2025.\n\n\"In addition to meeting the primary safety and efficacy outcomes, the reductions in AHI and ODI after only six months of therapy demonstrate a significant clinical impact for the patients,” said Dr. Atul Malhotra, lead investigator for the study, who is also a professor of medicine at University of California San Diego School of Medicine and sleep medicine specialist at University of California San Diego Health.\n\nThere were no serious adverse device-related or procedure-related events reported in OSPREY throughout the primary endpoint visits.\n\nFor more information on the aura6000 System and the treatment of OSA, visit the [LivaNova website](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livanova.com%2Fen-us%2Fobstructive-sleep-apnea&esheet=54150633&newsitemid=20241111606578&lan=en-US&anchor=LivaNova+website&index=2&md5=76807df6f0ef865813118295879aaa6d).\n\n1| The primary efficacy endpoint measured the difference in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) responder rates between active and no stimulation targeted hypoglossal nerve stimulation (THNS) therapy after seven months of follow-up with a predetermined p-value of p<0.025.  \n---|---  \n2| Per trial protocol, a responder is defined to have realized at least a 50% improvement from the baseline AHI, leading to an AHI value below 20.  \n  \n**About OSPREY**\n\nOSPREY is a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled open-label trial demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the aura6000™ Hypoglossal Nerve Stimulator System versus a no stimulation control in subjects with moderate to severe OSA who have failed or are unwilling to use positive airway pressure treatment.

We look forward to building on this momentum in the fourth quarter and in 2025, driven by our continued focus on performance, innovation, and talent.\"\n\n____________________   \n---  \n(1) Constant-currency percent change, total revenue excluding revenue from the ACS segment wind down, adjusted operating income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Constant-currency percent change excludes the impact from fluctuations in the various currencies in which the Company operates as compared to reported percent change. For an explanation of these and other non-GAAP measures used in this news release, see the section entitled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" For reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures, see the tables that accompany this news release.  \n  \n**Third-Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nThe following table summarizes revenue by segment (in millions):\n\n**Three Months Ended****September 30 ,**| **% Change**| **Constant-****Currency****% Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**  \nCardiopulmonary| $172.2| $149.0| 15.6 %| 15.4 %  \nNeuromodulation| 139.9| 128.9| 8.5 %| 8.8 %  \nOther (1)| 6.0| 8.3| (27.3) %| (27.5) %  \nTotal Net Revenue| 318.1| 286.1| 11.2 %| 11.2 %  \nLess: ACS (2)| 4.4| 6.8| (35.2) %| N/A  \nTotal Net Revenue, Excluding ACS| $313.7| $279.3| 12.3 %| 12.3 %  \n  \n(1)| Includes revenue from the Company’s former ACS reportable segment, as well as rental and site services income not allocated to segments.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Includes the results from the wind down portion of the Company's former ACS reportable segment.  \n  \n  * Numbers may not add precisely due to rounding. Segment financial information presented herein reflects LivaNova's change in segments, effective in the first quarter 2024, for all periods presented.\n\n  \n  \n**Cardiopulmonary** revenue increased 15.6% on a reported basis and 15.4% on a constant-currency basis versus the third quarter of 2023 with growth across all regions, driven by Essenz™Perfusion System sales and strong consumables demand.\n\n**Neuromodulation** revenue increased 8.5% on a reported basis and 8.8% on a constant-currency basis versus the third quarter of 2023 with growth in the U.S. and Rest of World regions, partially offset by a decline in Europe.\n\n_**Earnings Analysis**_\n\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, third-quarter 2024 operating income was $35.6 million, as compared to operating income of $4.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $63.6 million, as compared to adjusted operating income of $45.0 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nOn a U.S. GAAP basis, third-quarter 2024 diluted earnings per share was $0.60, as compared to diluted loss per share of $0.14 in the third quarter of 2023. Third-quarter 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.90, as compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.73 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Full-Year 2024 Guidance**\n\nLivaNova now expects revenue for full-year 2024 to grow between 8.5% and 9.5% on a constant-currency basis. When excluding the impact of the ACS segment wind down, the Company now expects revenue for full-year 2024 to grow between 10% and 11% on a constant-currency basis. Foreign currency is now expected to be negligible based on current exchange rates.\n\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share for 2024 is now expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.40, assuming a share count of approximately 55 million for full-year 2024. For 2024, the Company now estimates that adjusted free cash flow will be in the range of $110 to $130 million.\n\nAs discussed in the section entitled \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below, the Company is unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the type and extent of certain items that would be expected to impact GAAP measures but would not impact the non-GAAP measures. Accordingly, the Company is unable to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures included in this section to their most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable efforts.\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Instructions**\n\nThe Company will host a live audiocast at 12 p.m. London time (8 a.m. Eastern Time) on Wednesday, October 30, 2024 that will be accessible at [www.livanova.com/events](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.livanova.com%2Fevents&esheet=54144145&newsitemid=20241030433587&lan=en-US&anchor=www.livanova.com%2Fevents&index=1&md5=0f823d35b8dbf6abab8b02176b13f5f2).

Headquartered in London, LivaNova employs approximately 2,900 employees and has a presence in more than 100 countries for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals, and healthcare systems worldwide.

Non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, operational performance measures as prescribed by GAAP.\n\nIn this news release, the Company refers to comparable, constant-currency percent change in revenue. Company management believes that referring to comparable, constant-currency percent change is the most useful way to evaluate the revenue performance of LivaNova and to compare the revenue performance of current periods to prior periods on a consistent basis. Constant-currency percent change, a non-GAAP financial measure, measures the change in revenue between current and prior-year periods using average exchange rates in effect during the applicable prior-year period.\n\nLivaNova calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For example, forward-looking net revenue growth projections are estimated on a constant-currency basis and exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. Forward-looking non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance exclude items such as, but not limited to, changes in fair value of derivatives and contingent consideration arrangements and asset impairment charges that would be included in comparable GAAP financial measures. The most directly comparable GAAP measure for adjusted free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment excluding the impact of 3T litigation settlement payments, CARES Act tax stimulus benefits, SNIA financing costs, and gains related to dividends received from investments and further adjusted as needed for other charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's operational performance. However, non-GAAP financial adjustments on a forward-looking basis are subject to uncertainty and variability as they are dependent on many factors, including but not limited to, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, impacts from potential acquisitions or divestitures, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, gains or losses on the potential sale of businesses or other assets, restructuring costs, merger and integration activities, changes in fair value of derivatives, and contingent consideration arrangements, asset impairment charges and the tax impact of the aforementioned items, tax law changes, or other tax matters. Accordingly, the Company does not reconcile non-GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis as it is impractical to do so without unreasonable effort.\n\nThe Company also believes adjusted financial measures such as adjusted cost of sales, adjusted gross profit, adjusted selling, general, and administrative expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted other operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted income before tax, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, are measures that LivaNova generally uses to facilitate management review of the operational performance of the company, to serve as a basis for strategic planning, and in the design of incentive compensation plans. Additionally, the Company uses the non-GAAP liquidity measure adjusted free cash flow. Furthermore, adjusted financial measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s operational performance for different periods on a more comparable and consistent basis, and with other medical technology companies by adjusting for items that are not related to the operational performance of the Company or incurred in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nCertain statements in this news release, other than statements of historical or current fact, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These statements include, but are not limited to, LivaNova’s plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook, trends, the amount and timing of future cash distributions, prospects or future events, and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict. As a result, the Company’s actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Generally, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “may,” “could,” “seek,” “guidance,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” “believe,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “intend,” “forecast,” “foresee,” or variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based on estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by LivaNova and its management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, are inherently uncertain. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this news release, and include, but are not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties: volatility in the global market and worldwide economic conditions, including as caused by the invasion of Ukraine, the evolving instability in the Middle East, inflation, changing interest rates, foreign exchange fluctuations, changes to existing trade agreements and relationships between the U.S. and other countries, including the implementation of sanctions; cyber-attacks or other disruptions to the Company’s information technology systems or those of third parties with which the Company interacts; costs of complying with privacy and security of personal information requirements and laws; risks relating to supply chain pressures; changes in technology, including the development of superior or alternative technology or devices by competitors and/or competition from providers of alternative medical therapies; failure to obtain approvals or reimbursement in relation to the Company’s products; failure to establish, expand, or maintain market acceptance of the Company’s products for the treatment of the Company’s approved indications; failure to develop and commercialize new products and the rate and degree of market acceptance of such products; unfavorable results from clinical studies or failure to meet milestones; failure to comply with, or changes in, laws, regulations, or administrative practices affecting government regulation of the Company’s products; the risk of quality issues and the impacts thereof; risks relating to recalls, replacement of inventory, enforcement actions, or product liability claims; changes or reduction in reimbursement for the Company’s products or failure to comply with rules relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services; failure to comply with anti-bribery laws; losses or costs from pending or future lawsuits and governmental investigations, including in the case of the Company’s 3T Heater-Cooler and SNIA environmental litigations; risks associated with environmental laws and regulations as well as environmental liabilities, violations, protest voting, and litigation; product liability, intellectual property, shareholder-related, environmental-related, income tax, and other litigation, disputes, losses, and costs; failure to retain key personnel, prevent labor shortages, or manage labor costs; the failure of the Company’s R&D efforts to keep up with the rapid pace of technological development in the medical device industry; the risks relating to the impact of climate change and the risk of environmental, social, and governance pressures from internal and external stakeholders; failure to protect the Company’s proprietary intellectual property; failure of new acquisitions to further the Company’s strategic objectives or strengthen the Company’s existing businesses; the potential for impairments of intangible assets, goodwill, and other long-lived assets; risks relating to the Company’s indebtedness; effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting; changes in the Company’s profitability and/or failure to manage costs and expenses; fluctuations in future quarterly operating results and/or variations in revenue and operating expenses relative to estimates; changes in tax laws and regulations, including exposure to additional income tax liabilities; and other unknown or unpredictable factors that could harm the Company’s financial performance.\n\nThe foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties that affect the Company’s business, including those described in the “Risk Factors” section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and other documents filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission by LivaNova.\n\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the Company's forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of the forward-looking statements in this news release to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable law. If LivaNova updates one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that the Company will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\n\nVNS Therapy and Essenz are trademarks of LivaNova USA, Inc.\n\n**LIVANOVA PLC**  \n---  \n**NET REVENUE - UNAUDITED**  \n**( U.S. dollars in millions)**  \n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **% Change**| **Constant-Currency****% Change**  \n**Cardiopulmonary**  \nU.S.| $62.5| $52.3| 19.6 %| 19.6 %  \nEurope (1)| 40.9| 35.5| 15.2 %| 13.4 %  \nRest of World| 68.8| 61.2| 12.5 %| 13.0 %  \n172.2| 149.0| 15.6 %| 15.4 %  \n**Neuromodulation**  \nU.S.| 112.9| 102.5| 10.2 %| 10.2 %  \nEurope (1)| 11.9| 12.7| (5.8) %| (7.7) %  \nRest of World| 15.0| 13.7| 9.4 %| 13.6 %  \n139.9| 128.9| 8.5 %| 8.8 %  \n**Other Revenue(2)**| 6.0| 8.3| (27.3) %| (27.5) %  \n**Totals**  \nU.S.| 179.8| 161.6| 11.3 %| 11.3 %  \nEurope (1)| 52.8| 48.1| 9.7 %| 7.9 %  \nRest of World| 85.5| 76.4| 11.9 %| 13.0 %  \n$318.1| $286.1| 11.2 %| 11.2 %  \n  \n(1)| Includes countries in Europe where the Company has a direct sales presence.
