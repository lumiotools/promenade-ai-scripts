IBKR has a=iliates that operate electronic brokerage businesses around the world.\nIBKR’s ultimate parent, Interactive Brokers Group, Inc., is a NASDAQ-listed public company that trades under\nthe symbol “IBKR”.\nIt then fell more than $100,000 within 3 seconds and closed at $631,110 at the\nend of the day.\nThese events have highlighted deficiencies in two areas:\n1. The Limit Up-Limit Down Plan (the “LULD Plan”):\na. The LULD price-band applied to extremely high value stocks (such as BRK A)\nis too wide; and\nb. The Reference Price is calculated in a manner that is too reactive, following a\nreopening event, to price action in the moments following the reopening.\n2. The clearly erroneous execution rules (“CEE Rules”) of the various national\nsecurities exchanges eliminate discretion to review a trade as clearly erroneous if\nthe trade occurred within the published LULD band.\nBefore getting into specifics, however, we think it is worth reviewing in slightly more detail\nour understanding of the facts surrounding the events of June 3.\nI. Background: Trading in BRK A on the Morning of June 3\nOn the morning of Monday, June 3, 2024, at approximately 9:50 am, the price of BRK A\nsuddenly plummeted in the space of a few seconds from approximately $622,000 per\nshare to approximately $185 per share, a decrease of over 99.97%.2 This occurred in\nconnection with an unspecified technical issue at NYSE and/or the Securities Industry\nAutomation Corporation (“SIAC”, an ahiliate of NYSE). This technical issue and dramatic\nprice event led NYSE to promptly halt BRK A from trading.\nNews of BRK A’s anomalous price move quickly spread across social media. Many retail\ntraders, including some of our clients, in an ill-advised attempt to take advantage of this\n“opportunity”, unwisely submitted market orders to their brokers during the trading halt,\npresumably expecting those orders to be filled at approximately $185/share when trading\nresumed.\nThis influx of buying interest during the halt led to a substantial buy-side order imbalance in\nNYSE’s limit order book for BRK A. We have limited visibility to what the Designated Market\nMaker (“DMM”) for BRK A at NYSE may have done to attempt to resolve that imbalance\nprior to re-opening trading, but it is clear that the imbalance remained unresolved as of the\nre-open of trading.3 As a result, trading resumed at approximately 11:35:54 am with a\nreopening cross at $648,000. This is particularly notable in that it is:\n2 A number of other NYSE-listed symbols also su=ered significant price dislocations in connection\nwith the same technical issues, but BRK A’s price move was the most dramatic.\n3 NYSE also did not act to bust the low-priced trades resulting from their system issue until nearly\n4 pm, several hours after the stock had re-opened. Accordingly, the displayed / disseminated last trade price\non the consolidated tape remained approximately $185 until the re-open.\n2\n• nearly 4.2% higher than the fair value price of approximately $622,000 that BRK A\nhad been trading at immediately prior to the technical issues that morning, without\nany intervening news regarding the company’s fortunes; and\n• more than 2.5% higher than the highest price (approximately $632,000) at which\nBRK A had traded in the prior month.\nOver the course of the next 98 seconds, the price of BRK A climbed an additional $94,000,\nrising to as high as $741,971.39 per share. That $94,000 represented an increase of\napproximately 14.5% over the re-opening price less than two minutes earlier and an\nadditional approximately 15.1% (on top of the 4.2% increase at the reopen) over the most\nrecent fair market value of $622,000 prior to the beginning of the system issue that\nmorning.\nAfter peaking at over $741,000, the price then fell even more precipitously over the next 5\nseconds, dropping over $100,000 in a single tick. Ultimately, BRK A closed at $631,110 that\nday.\nMany of the retail traders that had placed market orders during the trading halt were filled\nin the re-open or at various prices during the run-up to the peak, including some who were\nfilled at the peak price. IBKR – and we presume a number of other broker-dealers –\npromptly filed petitions with NYSE and the other exchanges seeking to have these\nanomalously high-priced trades busted as clearly erroneous. NYSE (and the other\nexchanges) determined that they lacked authority to review these trades as clearly\nerroneous because they had occurred within the disseminated LULD bands, and thus\ndeclined to act on these petitions.\nAs a result, traders (or their brokers who compensated them) and NYSE/SIAC (which, after\nan outcry from street participants, compensated some firms for losses under NYSE Rule\n18) suhered tens of millions of dollars in losses in connection with trades that never should\nhave occurred in the first place and never should have been allowed to stand if they did\noccur.\nIn light of those events, we now address the rule deficiencies that we believe they made\nplain.\nII. Deficiencies in the LULD Plan\nA. The defined LULD bands are a poor fit for extremely high-value stocks.\nThe LULD Plan divides all securities subject to the plan into two tiers. BRK A, as a\nTier 2 NMS stock (since it is not an S&P 500 or Russell 1000 constituent or one of a\nHad NYSE instead waited to re-open the stock until after it had busted the trades and corrected the tape,\nmuch of that market-buy interest from retail customers might have resolved itself by customers cancelling\ntheir orders. But instead, the stock was allowed to re-open while spurious last-sale data was still being\ndisseminated.\n3\nselect set of ETPs), is subject to a Percentage Parameter band of 10% relative to the\ncalculated Reference Price.4\nThis may be appropriate for most non-S&P 500 stocks or Russell 1000 stocks. But\nunfettered freedom to trade up to 10% in either direction on a stock trading at\nwell over $600,000 per share (i.e., a more than $60,000 price move in either\ndirection) is clearly inappropriate.\nBy comparison, under the price bands set forth in the various exchange CEE Rules\n(e.g., NYSE Rule 7.10), if the LULD plan had not applied, the applicable price\nband (relative to the reference price) would have been only 3%.5\nPut another way, the reopening price itself (which was nearly 4.2% away from the\nlast reasonable reference price that morning) would have already been outside of\nthe clearly erroneous execution band, and the immediately-subsequent 14+%\nrise would have only punctuated the point.\nB. The Reference Price under the LULD Plan is inappropriately reactive, especially\nimmediately following a reopening.\nUnder the LULD Plan, the Reference Price is calculated as the arithmetic mean of\nprices reported to the consolidated tape over a window of not more than five\nminutes. Immediately following a reopening, that window is even shorter (since\nthere is less than five minutes of prices to incorporate).\nAs a result, there is little to prevent the Reference Price from virtually tracking the\nmarket move-for-move during those first critical minutes following a re-opening.6\nIndeed, such a short sliding window for calculation of the Reference Price\nprovides little drag on the ability of the market to gyrate to wildly inappropriate\nprices; it may prevent flash crashes that occur in seconds, but it does little\nmore than that.\nIII. Lack of Discretion for Exchanges to Review Clearly Erroneous Trades\nThe above deficiencies might not be a problem if the LULD Plan formed just one part of a\nmulti-layered array of tools in the exchanges’ toolbox to address transient, wild price\naction.\n4 See LULD Plan, Appendix A (Percentage Parameters), Section II (Tier 2 NMS Stocks), available at\nhttps://cdn.luldplan.com/plans/LULD-Plan-Amendment-20.pdf.\n5 The CEE Rules generally provide for a price band of 3% relative to the reference price during regular\ntrading hours for stocks over $50/share.\n6 Although the LULD Plan does include a 30-second minimum dwell time for the Reference Price under\nSection V.B.1 of the Plan following a re-open, our observation is that that still does little to prevent wild price\nexcursions, given how broad the band is.\n4\nIndeed, if the exchanges’ CEE Rules currently existed in the same form they had prior\nto the adoption of the LULD Plan, the exchanges would still have a second tool\navailable to them in the unusual circumstances where the LULD Plan was inadequate\nto curtail unnatural price action.\nYet the current CEE Rules of the various national securities exchanges prohibit them\nfrom taking any action to bust trades occurring during regular trading hours if the LULD\nbands are in ebect and the trade happened within those bands, i.e., if:\n• the relevant symbol is subject to the LULD Plan;\n• the LULD bands were being disseminated at the time of the trade; and\n• the trade occurs within the LULD price bands.7\nThis unfairly and unnecessarily leaves market participants to bear losses as a result of\nparticularly disorderly markets that the LULD Plan was inadequate to prevent – losses that\ncould have been avoided entirely if the trades at spurious prices were simply busted as the\ntraditional clearly erroneous price bands (as found in NYSE Equities Rule 7.10(c)(2)) would\nallow.\nThe sheer complexity and interconnectedness of modern markets and trading systems,\nboth automated and otherwise, makes it impossible to envision in advance every set of\ncircumstances that could result in extreme, erroneous price moves, or to design a system\nthat will always prevent them. Returning discretion to the exchanges and allowing them\nthe flexibility to promptly address unexpected events and outcomes, including with\ntrade busts where appropriate, is the necessary cure.\nIV. Conclusion\nAccordingly, we urge the Commission and Stah, in conversation with the various exchanges\nand the LULD Plan Advisory Committee, to:\n• Restore discretion to the exchanges to bust trades occurring within the LULD bands\nunder extraordinary circumstances.8\n7 See, e.g., NYSE Rule 7.10(c)(1); NYSE Arca Equities Rule 7.10(c)(1); NASDAQ Equities Rule\n11890(c)(1); Cboe BZX Rule 11.17(c)(1); IEX Rule 11.270(c)(1); MEMX Rule 11.15(c)(1). The only exception to\nthis limitation on the exchanges is in the case of “(1) a corporate action or new issue or (2) a security that\nenters a Trading Pause pursuant to the LULD Plan and resumes trading without an auction, [and the]\nReference Price [] is determined to be erroneous by an O=icer of the Exchange because it clearly deviated\nfrom the theoretical value of the security.” See, e.g., NYSE Rule 7.10(c)(1)(C) (emphasis added). Even where\nthat exception applies, the sole available remedy is simply to apply a corrected Reference Price, and measure\nthe trade in question relative to that Reference Price and the LULD Plan Percentage Parameter. Id.\n8 If the Commission and Sta= are concerned about exchanges being granted discretion too liberally,\nappropriate safeguards could be put in place, such as limiting the exercise of discretion to only when a\nplurality or majority of the listing / UTP exchanges agree.\n5\n• For LULD Plan Tier 2 stocks trading at over $10,000/share,9 narrow the LULD\nPercentage Parameter to the lesser of:\n5% (the same as it would be if it was a Tier 1 stock); and\no\n$25,000 (so that the maximum price swing within the band cannot grow\no\nwithout bound as the price of the stock grows).\n• Make the LULD Plan Reference Price calculation less reactive under circumstances\nsurrounding a re-open in connection with an exchange system issue.10\nOne way to do that would be to require an ohicer of the listing exchange to\no\nset a “Prior Fair Price”, based on the last orderly trade price before the halt,\nand incorporate that Prior Fair Price into the Reference Price in a way that:\n§ gives it substantial weight at the time of the reopen, and\n§ decays that weight down to zero over a period of 5-10 minutes.\nWe would be happy to discuss any of these ideas with the Commission, Stah, LULD Plan\nAdvisory Committee, or the Stah of the various exchanges at your convenience.\nRespectfully,\nMilan Galik Scott M. Litvinoh\nChief Executive Ohicer Chief Regulatory & Product Counsel\nInteractive Brokers Group Interactive Brokers Group\nCc: Megan Barbero, General Counsel\nAndrea Orr, Deputy Director, Division of Trading & Markets\nDavid Saltiel, Deputy Director &\nHead of the Ohice of Analytics and Research, Division of Trading & Markets\nDavid Shillman, Associate Director, Division of Trading & Markets\n9 As a practical matter, there is only one NMS stock that trades at over $10,000 per share – BRK A.\nAccordingly, an alternate approach would be to consider whether exchange listing standards should set an\nabsolute price ceiling per share – e.g., $25,000 per share – above which an issuer must either (i) split the\nstock to reduce the price below the ceiling or (ii) delist the stock from the exchange.\n10 Relatedly, consider whether tighter LULD bands ought to apply – e.g., 75% of the width the band\nwould otherwise be – for some period of time (e.g., 15 minutes) following a re-open in connection with an\nexchange system issue.\n6"
