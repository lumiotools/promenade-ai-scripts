We are confident that Blackstone will position ROIC’s portfolio for continued growth and success.”\n\nJacob Werner, Co-Head of Americas Acquisitions at Blackstone Real Estate, said, “This transaction reflects our strong conviction in necessity-based, grocery anchored shopping centers in densely populated geographies. The sector is experiencing accelerating fundamentals, benefiting from nearly a decade of virtually no new construction, while demand for brick-and-mortar grocery stores, restaurants, fitness and other lifestyle retailers remains healthy. We are pleased to be acquiring ROIC, which owns a unique collection of high-quality assets in some of the most desirable West Coast markets.”\n\nThe transaction has been approved by ROIC’s Board of Directors and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the Company’s common stockholders.\n\nJ.P.

expense and recovery adjustments related to prior periods and other miscellaneous adjustments.\n\n**NON-GAAP DISCLOSURES**\n\nFunds from operations (“FFO”), is a widely recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance. FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the “White Paper” on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures.\n\nThe Company uses cash net operating income (“NOI”) internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company’s properties. The Company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the Company’s properties as this measure is not affected by the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, the cost of the Company’s funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to the Company’s ownership of properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from operating income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company’s properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the Company’s properties but does not measure the Company’s performance as a whole and is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP. The Company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent and amortization of lease intangibles, debt-related expenses and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the Company’s cash NOI may not be comparable to other REITs.\n\n**Contact:** Nicolette O’Leary _Director of Investor Relations_ 858-677-0900[ _noleary@roireit.net_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4DE1urDwnfzC_iG05sXnNEhN_C8XH5OCG9KK9RBxc8RgtJYSSikKc4PZVFWvZ1fk1x1egCdSiIvjt6UUbUaB26hnFX11BElkgIrNTVP9ND8=)\n\n![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MTExNDA5OGEtOGE5OS00ZThiLTkxZjMtOTA5ZjE3OGU1NjUyLTEwMzc5MTE=/tiny/Retail-Opportunity-Investments.png)\n\n[![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83951/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/Component-21.svg) Printed Materials ](/printed-materials) [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83951/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/Component-20.svg) Email Alerts ](/email-alerts) [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83951/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/Component-18.svg) Download Library ](/download-library) [![](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83951/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/Component-19.svg) RSS News Feeds ](/rss-news-feeds)\n\n[![ROIC Logo](/sites/g/files/knoqqb83951/themes/site/client_site/dist/images/ROIC_-NEW-logo_vector-reflex-white-no-text.png)](https://www.roireit.net/)\n\nRetail Opportunity Investments Corp.
