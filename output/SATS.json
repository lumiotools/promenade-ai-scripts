The network will feature a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), which will allow the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to test RIC-based software applications for military networks. The 5G Open RAN prototype equipment will be installed on Fort Bliss to operate a temporary network for evaluation purposes, which will then transition to serve as part of the Hughes commercial network supporting both DoD and commercial customers in and around Fort Bliss. The project is a joint effort of the U.S. Army, the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering (OUSD(R&E)).\n\n[ ![EchoStar \\(PRNewsfoto/EchoStar Corporation\\)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2309198/ECHOSTAR_LOGO_RED.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2309198/ECHOSTAR_LOGO_RED.html)\n\n\"This contract award is an important step forward for the U.S. Department of Defense's efforts to develop next generation communications networks that can empower innovative applications,\" said Dan Rasmussen, senior vice president, North American Enterprise, Hughes Network Systems. \"The EchoStar team is looking forward to collaborating with the U.S. Army to test and evaluate specific military use cases that leverage 5G ORAN and the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). The Fort Bliss program will pave the way for further RIC exploration, enhancing network performance for both U.S. government and commercial applications.\"\n\nHughes will serve as the prime contractor, demonstrating, qualifying, and integrating a RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) in the test network, which will also incorporate ORAN infrastructure, engineering expertise, and 5G spectrum from Boost Mobile, another EchoStar company.\n\nThe RIC, which acts as a platform for various software applications, will allow the DoD to test various RAN applications. The primary use case that the Fort Bliss prototype will test through the RIC is the ability to rapidly change spectrum at the 5G control node, a capability that has real world relevance to resilient communications for a mobile command post.\n\nThe scope of the Open RAN project at Fort Bliss is designed to meet key strategic milestones that support FY 2024 National Defense Authorization Act requirements and DoD initiatives to diversify supply chain. It will also improve Army processes for enabling MNO access to installations. This initiative will serve as a testing ground for developing new Open RAN RIC tactical applications, developing footprints for other installations, and establishing a training site for both civilian and military technical staff. The Army will also evaluate policies and network architecture standards that leverage commercially interchangeable and vendor agnostic solutions to enhance the Army Unified Network.\n\nThe Fort Bliss program will build on EchoStar's expertise in ORAN, already demonstrated through a _[5G ORAN installation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304481-1&h=3622277108&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hughes.com%2Fresources%2Fpress-releases%2Fhughes-selected-deploy-private-5g-network-dod&a=5G+ORAN+installation)_ deployed at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island (NASWI), which _[was completed in 2023](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304481-1&h=2889441168&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnas-whidbey-island-5g-network-launched-301786554.html&a=was+completed+in+2023)_ and _[extended in March](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4304481-1&h=633317443&u=https%3A%2F%2Fir.echostar.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fnews-release-details%2Fdod-extends-contract-oran-based-private-5g-networks-through-2025&a=extended+in+March)_.

Diluted loss per share was $1.67, compared to earnings per share of $1.06 in the year-ago period.\n  * Consolidated OIBDA totaled $1.23 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.69 billion in the year-ago period. (See OIBDA definition and non-GAAP reconciliation below.)\n\n\n\n\"The EchoStar team continued to execute against our plan in the third quarter. Our efforts focused on profitable customer acquisition and retention, strengthening our consumer offerings and enhancing our nationwide Open RAN 5G network,\" said Hamid Akhavan, president and CEO, EchoStar Corporation. \"In addition, we recently announced a series of transformative transactions that will disrupt the wireless and pay-TV industries. We secured financing to meet our November debt maturity and announced an agreement with a group of our convertible note holders. This last transaction provides approximately $5.2 billion in additional financing and extends payment terms for the existing convertible notes tendered. In addition, we agreed to sell our pay-TV business to DIRECTV, subject to successful completion of an ongoing exchange and other closing conditions.\"\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30, 2024:**\n\n  * Net Pay-TV subscribers decreased approximately 43,000 in the third quarter, compared to a decrease of 64,000 in the year-ago quarter. Sling TV subscribers increased 145,000 in the third quarter, compared to a 117,000 increase in the year-ago quarter. The company closed the third quarter with 8.03 million Pay-TV subscribers including 5.89 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.14 million SLING TV subscribers. This decrease in net Pay-TV subscriber losses resulted from higher net SLING TV subscriber additions in the third quarter compared to the year-ago quarter and a lower DISH TV churn rate, offset by lower gross new DISH TV subscriber activations.\n  * Retail Wireless subscribers, excluding Affordable Connectivity Program (\"ACP\") subscribers, increased approximately 62,000 in the third quarter. The company closed the third quarter with 6.98 million Retail Wireless subscribers. Retail Wireless net subscribers decreased by approximately 297,000 in the third quarter, compared to a decrease of 225,000 in the year-ago quarter. The increase in net retail wireless subscriber losses resulted from net losses of government subsidized subscribers, including ACP subscribers, compared to net additions in the year ago quarter, primarily due to the ACP program funding concluding on June 1, 2024. The third quarter was positively impacted by a lower retail wireless churn rate.\n  * The company closed the third quarter with 912,000 Broadband Satellite subscribers, a decrease of approximately 43,000 in the quarter, compared to 59,000 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease in net Broadband Satellite subscriber losses was primarily due to the new EchoStar XXIV (Jupiter 3) satellite service launch and increased subscriber demand for our new satellite service plans.
