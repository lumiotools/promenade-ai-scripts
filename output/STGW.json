The Company’s\nrepresentatives may also make forward-looking statements orally or in writing from time to time. Statements in this document that are not historical facts, including, statements about the Company’s beliefs and expectations, future financial performance, growth,\nand future prospects, the Company’s strategy, business and economic trends and growth, technological leadership and differentiation, potential and completed acquisitions, anticipated operating efficiencies and synergies and estimates of amounts for redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests and deferred acquisition consideration, constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which are generally denoted by words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “assume,” “believe,” “continue,” “could,” “create,” “develop,”\n“estimate,” “expect,” “focus,” “forecast,” “foresee,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “in development,” “intend,” “likely,” “look,” “maintain,” “may,” “ongoing,” “opportunity,” “outlook,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “probable,” “project,” “should,” “target,” “will,” “would” or\nthe negative of such terms or other variations thereof and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of current plans, estimates and projections are subject to change based on a number of factors, including those outlined in this section.\nForward-looking statements in this document are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the Company. Although the management of the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements\nare based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. The material assumptions upon which such forward-looking statements are based\ninclude, among others, assumptions with respect to general business, economic and market conditions, the competitive environment, anticipated and unanticipated tax consequences and anticipated and unanticipated costs. These forward-looking statements are\nbased on current plans, estimates and projections, and are subject to change based on a number of factors, including those outlined in this section. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the\nCompany’s control. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or\nfuture events, if any.\nForward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Such risk factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• risks associated with international, national and regional unfavorable economic conditions that could affect the Company or its clients;\n• demand for the Company’s services, which may precipitate or exacerbate other risks and uncertainties;\n• inflation and actions taken by central banks to counter inflation;\n• the Company’s ability to attract new clients and retain existing clients;\n• the impact of a reduction in client spending and changes in client advertising, marketing and corporate communications requirements;\n• financial failure of the Company’s clients;\n• the Company’s ability to retain and attract key employees;\n• the Company’s ability to compete in the markets in which it operates;\n• the Company’s ability to achieve its cost saving initiatives;\n• the Company’s implementation of strategic initiatives;\n• the Company’s ability to remain in compliance with its debt agreements and the Company’s ability to finance its contingent payment obligations when due and payable, including but not limited to those relating to redeemable noncontrolling interests\nand deferred acquisition consideration;\n• the Company’s ability to manage its growth effectively;\n• the Company’s ability to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions that complement and expand the Company’s business capabilities and realize cost savings, synergies or other anticipated benefits of newly acquired businesses, or that even if realized,\nsuch benefits may take longer to realize than expected;\n• the Company’s ability to identify and complete divestitures and to achieve the anticipated benefits therefrom;\n• the Company’s ability to develop products incorporating new technologies, including augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and virtual reality, and realize benefits from such products;\n• the Company’s use of artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence;\n• adverse tax consequences for the Company, its operations and its stockholders, that may differ from the expectations of the Company, including that future changes in tax laws, potential increases to corporate tax rates in the United States and\ndisagreements with tax authorities on the Company’s determinations that may result in increased tax costs;\n• adverse tax consequences in connection with the Transactions, including the incurrence of material Canadian federal income tax (including material “emigration tax”);\n• the Company’s unremediated material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and its ability to establish and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, including the risk that the Company’s internal controls will\nfail to detect misstatements in its financial statements;\n• the Company’s ability to accurately forecast its future financial performance and provide accurate guidance;\n• the Company’s ability to protect client data from security incidents or cyberattacks;\n• economic disruptions resulting from war and other geopolitical tensions (such as the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East), terrorist activities and natural disasters;\n• stock price volatility; and\n• foreign currency fluctuations.\nInvestors should carefully consider these risk factors, other risk factors described herein, and the additional risk factors outlined in more detail in our 2023 Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on March 11, 2024, and\naccessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov, under the caption “Risk Factors,” and in the Company’s other SEC filings.\n2\nDEFINITIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to its reported results, Stagwell Inc. has included in this earnings presentation certain financial results that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines as\n\"non-GAAP Financial Measures.\" Management believes that such non-GAAP financial measures, when read in conjunction with the Company's reported results, can provide useful\nsupplemental information for investors analyzing period to period comparisons of the Company's results. Such non-GAAP financial measures include the following:\nPro Forma Results: The Pro Forma amounts presented for each period were prepared by combining the historical standalone statements of operations for each of legacy MDC and\nSMG. The unaudited pro forma results are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations or consolidated\nfinancial condition would have been had the combination actually occurred on the date indicated, nor do they purport to project the future consolidated results of operations or\nconsolidated financial condition for any future period or as of any future date. The Company has excluded a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA to net income\nunder the “unreasonable efforts” exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K.\n1) Organic Revenue: “Organic revenue growth” and “organic revenue decline” refer to the positive or negative results, respectively, of subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition\n(disposition) components from total revenue growth. The acquisition (disposition) component is calculated by aggregating prior period revenue for any acquired businesses, less the prior\nperiod revenue of any businesses that were disposed of during the current period. The organic revenue growth (decline) component reflects the constant currency impact of (a) the change\nin revenue of the partner firms that the Company has held throughout each of the comparable periods presented, and (b) “non-GAAP acquisitions (dispositions), net”. Non-GAAP\nacquisitions (dispositions), net consists of (i) for acquisitions during the current year, the revenue effect from such acquisition as if the acquisition had been owned during the equivalent\nperiod in the prior year and (ii) for acquisitions during the previous year, the revenue effect from such acquisitions as if they had been owned during that entire year (or same period as the\ncurrent reportable period), taking into account their respective pre-acquisition revenues for the applicable periods, and (iii) for dispositions, the revenue effect from such disposition as if they\nhad been disposed of during the equivalent period in the prior year.\n2) Net New Business: Estimate of annualized revenue for new wins less annualized revenue for losses incurred in the period.\n3) Adjusted EBITDA: defined as Net income excluding non-operating income or expense to achieve operating income, plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation,\ndeferred acquisition consideration adjustments, and other items. Other items include restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, and nonrecurring items.\n4) Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as (i) Net income (loss) attributable to Stagwell Inc. common shareholders, plus net income attributable to Class C shareholders, excluding amortization\nexpense, impairment and other losses, stock-based compensation, deferred acquisition consideration adjustments, discrete tax items, and other items, divided by (ii) (a) the per weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding plus (b) the weighted average number of Class C shares outstanding (if dilutive). Other items includes restructuring costs, acquisition-\nrelated expenses, and non-recurring items, and subject to the anti-dilution rules.\n5) Free Cash Flow: defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, change in net working capital, cash taxes, interest, and distributions to minority interests, but excludes contingent\nM&A payments.\n6) Financial Guidance: The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as it cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results.\nIncluded in this earnings presentation are tables reconciling reported Stagwell Inc. results to arrive at certain of these non-GAAP financial measures.\n3\nReiterating Full-Year 2024 Outlook\n5% - 7%\nOrganic Net Revenue Growth\nFINANCIAL\nOutlook\n4% - 5%\nOrganic Net Revenue Growth ex.

We calculate organic net revenue growth (decline) by subtracting the net impact of acquisitions (divestitures)\nand the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations from the aggregate year-over-year increase or decrease in\nthe Company's reported net revenue. The net impact of acquisitions (divestitures) reflects the year-over-year change\nin the Company’s reported net revenue attributable to the impact of all individual entities that were acquired or\ndivested in the current and prior year. We calculate impact of an acquisition as follows: (a) for an entity acquired\nduring the current year, we present the entity’s prior year net revenue for the same period during which we owned\nit in the current year as impact of the acquisition in the current year; and (b) for an entity acquired in the prior year,\nwe present the entity’s prior year net revenue for the period during which we did not own the entity in the prior year\nas impact of the acquisition in the current year. We calculate impact of a divestiture as follows: (a) for a divestiture\nin the current year, we present the entity’s prior year net revenue for the same period during which we no longer\nowned it in the current year as impact of the divestiture in the current year; and (b) for a divestiture in the prior year,\nwe present the entity’s prior year net revenue for the period during which we owned it in the prior year as impact of\nthe divestiture in the current year. We calculate the impact of any acquisition or divestiture without adjusting for\nforeign currency exchange fluctuations. The impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations reflects the year-over-\nyear change in the Company’s reported net revenue attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We\ncalculate the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations for the portion of the reporting period in which we\nrecognized revenue from a foreign entity in both the current year and the prior year. The impact is calculated as the\ndifference between (1) reported prior period net revenue (converted to U.S. dollars at historical foreign currency\nexchange rates) and (2) prior period net revenue converted to U.S. dollars at current period foreign exchange rates.\n(2) Net New Business: Estimate of annualized revenue for new wins less annualized revenue for losses incurred in\nthe period.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA: defined as Net income excluding non-operating income or expense to achieve operating\nincome, plus depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred acquisition consideration\nadjustments, and other items. Other items include restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, and non-\nrecurring items.\n(4) Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as (i) Net income (loss) attributable to Stagwell Inc. common shareholders, plus\nnet income attributable to Class C shareholders, excluding amortization expense, impairment and other losses, stock-\nbased compensation, deferred acquisition consideration adjustments, discrete tax items, and other items, divided by\n(ii) (a) the per weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus (b) the weighted average number of\nClass C shares outstanding, (if dilutive). Other items includes restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses, and\nnon-recurring items, and subject to the anti-dilution rules.\n(5) Free Cash Flow: defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, change in net working capital, cash taxes,\ninterest, and distributions to minority interests, but excludes contingent M&A payments. Free Cash Flow Conversion\nis the percentage of adjusted EBITDA.\nIncluded in this earnings release are tables reconciling reported Stagwell Inc. results to arrive at certain of these non-\nGAAP financial measures.\nPage 4\n`\nThis document contains forward-looking statements. within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the\n“Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

Republicans closed in on the Democratic advantage of early and mail-in voting. Voters primarily relied on TV news channels for election coverage, followed by social media, and are split on whether coverage was biased. Looking ahead to the new administration, voters are divided on perceptions of Trump but want him to prioritize tackling inflation.\n\n“This was an election about issues, and the economy and immigration played the biggest roles. Trump won on a clear message of middle- and working-class economics,” saidMark Penn, Co-Director of the Harvard CAPS / Harris poll and Stagwell Chairman and CEO. “But while he’s won over people up to 54% and Republicans are supportive of his policies, he has to be careful in over-projecting his mandate – underneath is still a division of the election that has not yet resolved itself.”\n\n**TRUMP +2 ON HARRIS IN FINAL POLLING; +4 AMONG INDEPENDENTS**\n\n  * 50% of voters say they voted for Trump, including 92% of Republicans and 49% of Independents; while 48% of voters say they voted for Harris, including 90% of Democrats and 45% of Independents.\n  * 82% of voters say they voted (Democrat: 86%; Republican: 87%; Independent: 70%). Non-voters cited lack of motivation, feeling like their vote didn’t matter, and dislike of the candidates as top reasons they did not vote.\n  * 37% of voters voted in-person on Election Day, 32% voted in-person before Election Day, and 31% voted by mail. 56% of the electorate say they made up their mind on who they were voting for before September. 34% of Democrats, 28% of Republicans, and 32% of Independents voted by mail.\n  * 11% of the 2024 electorate were first-time voters. 31% of first-time voters decided who they were voting for before September, 24% decided the week of the election, and 20% decided on Election Day.\n  * 74% of voters voted on down-ballot races (House of Representatives: 62%; U.S. Senate: 52%; Governor: 34%).\n\n\n\n**VOTERS MOTIVATED BY ISSUES AND CHANGE**\n\n  * 80% of voters say the candidate’s position on issues was the most important factor when it came to casting their vote compared to personal qualities (Harris: 71%; Trump: 90%; Democrat: 76%; Republican: 87%; Independent: 78%;).\n  * The majority of voters said their response to the most important issue facing the country was a main reason for their candidate choice. Of those who said immigration was the most important issue facing the country, 87% said it was one of the main reasons, if not the main reason for their vote (abortion: 79%; inflation: 77%; climate change: 66%). 29% of voters said inflation was _the_ main reason for their vote, 28% pointed to immigration, and 26% pointed to abortion.\n  * 76% of voters say they voted for change rather than continuity in how the country is managed (Harris: 60%; Trump: 91%; Democrat: 62%; Republican: 89%; Independent: 78%).\n  * Of key events from the presidential campaign, voters say the Trump vs. Harris debate (36%), Trump surviving the assassination attempt (32%), and Trump declaring no tax on tips (32%) made them more likely to vote for Trump.\n\n\n\n**TRUMP AND GOP APPROVAL RATING REFLECT ELECTION RESULTS AND DISCONTENT WITH DIRECTION OF COUNTRY, INFLATION, AND IMMIGRATION**\n\n  * Trump’s approval rating as president-elect is at 54%, 12 points higher than Biden’s as president, including 91% of Republicans and 49% of Independents. The majority of male, 18-54 year old, white, Hispanic, urban, and rural voters approve of Trump.\n  * 49% of voters approve of the Republican Party’s job (+3 from October), while 44% approve of that of the Democratic Party (-3 from October).\n  * 27% of voters say the country is on the right track, down 4 percentage points from October (Democrat: 29%; Republican: 32%; Independent: 17%).\n  * Inflation (45%) and immigration (16%) continue to be the most important issues to voters personally, with inflation a concern across party lines, immigration of more concern for Republicans (28%), and abortion (18%) and climate change (13%) more of a concern for Democrats.\n\n\n\n**PERCEPTIONS OF TRUMP STILL DIVIDED FOLLOWING THE ELECTION**\n\n  * 54% of voters say Trump has been trying to unify rather than divide the country since the election (Democrat: 24%; Republican: 89%; Independent: 50%).\n  * 52% of voters believe Trump is a threat to democracy (Democrat: 81%; Republican: 16%; Independent: 45%). 53% say Trump should continue to be tried on criminal charges (Democrat: 87%; Republican: 16%; Independent: 55%).\n  * 68% of voters say their greatest hope for the new Trump administration is to end inflation and price increases (Democrat: 57%; Republican: 81%; Independent: 68%), followed by the revitalization of the American economy (43%) and American values (42%).\n  * 46% of voters say their greatest fear is Trump behaving like a dictator (Democrat: 74%; Republican: 16%; Independent: 49%). Other top fears among Democrats are irreparable damage to the U.S. government and agencies (56%) and the Trump administration moving too far to the right (55%). The greatest fear among Republicans is massive protests by the left (47%).\n  * Of Trump’s cabinet appointments, more voters favor rather than opposeSusie Wiles(+11),Mike Huckabee(+6),Vivek Ramaswamy(+5), andMarco Rubio(+3). Voters are split onElon Musk(+1) and opposeMatt Gaetz(-8).\n\n\n\n**VOTERS FOLLOWED ELECTION NEWS CLOSELY, RELYING ON TV AND SOCIAL MEDIA; BELIEVE MUSK HAD BIGGEST IMPACT**\n\n  * 81% of voters say they followed the presidential election somewhat or very closely.\n  * 46% of voters say they used TV news channels (Democrat: 45%; Republican: 49%; Independent: 42%), while 23% used social media platforms (Democrat: 26%; Republican: 22%; Independent: 20%) and 10% relied on news outlet websites.\n  * ABC News (36%) and Fox TV News (33%) were the most popular TV channels for election coverage, while Facebook (43%), Google (39%), and YouTube (39%) were the most popular social media platforms for news.\n  * 51% of voters say they felt election news was fair while 49% believe it was biased. Among those who felt news was biased, 57% say it was biased against Trump and Republicans (Democrat: 23%; Republicans: 87%; Independent: 51%).\n  * 60% of voters say journalists today are mostly practicing advocacy as opposed to unbiased journalism.\n  * Elon Musk(65%),Taylor Swift(63%), andOprahWinfrey (54%) were the most known endorsements heading into the election. 71% believe Musk’s endorsement had the biggest impact on the election (Joe Rogan: 43%;Taylor Swift: 36%).\n  * 42% of voters sayElon Musk’sendorsement had some or significant impact on their vote (Democrat: 32%; Republican: 55%; Independent: 31%), and 37% say the same aboutJoe Rogan(Democrat: 31%; Republican: 47%; Independent: 28%).\n\n\n\nThe November Harvard CAPS / Harris poll survey was conducted online withinthe United StatesonNovember 13-14, 2024, among 1,732 registered voters by The Harris Poll and HarrisX.
