Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements about our plans, objectives,\nexpectations, assumptions or future events. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"anticipate,” \"estimate,” \"plan,” \"project,”\n\"continuing,” \"ongoing,” \"expect,” \"we believe,” \"we intend,” \"may,” \"should,” \"will,” \"could” and similar expressions denoting uncertainty or an action that may, will or is\nexpected to occur in the future. These statements involve estimates, assumptions, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to\ndiffer materially from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these\nforward-looking statements.\nExamples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:\n● the anticipated timing of the development of future products or services;\n● projections of costs, revenue, earnings, capital structure and other financial items;\n● statements of our plans and objectives;\n● statements regarding the capabilities of our business operations;\n● statements of expected future economic performance;\n● statements regarding competition in our market; and\n● assumptions underlying statements regarding us or our business.\nForward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions\nregarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking\nstatements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our\ncontrol. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these\nforward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements\ninclude, among others, the following:\n● our ability to manage our current and projected financial position and estimated cash burn rate, including our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues and\ncapital requirements, and ultimately our ability to continue as a going concern;\n● our ability to raise additional capital or additional funding to further develop and expand our business to meet our long-term business objectives. We have limited\nrevenues and we cannot predict when or if we will achieve significant revenues and sustained profitability;\n● our ability to achieve significant revenues and sustained profitability;\n● impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets;\n● changes in customer demand;\n● our ability to develop our brands cost-effectively, to attract new customers and retain customers on a cost-effective basis;\n● our ability to compete in the markets in which our websites participate;\n● our ability to make strategic actions, including acquisitions and dispositions and our success in integrating acquired businesses;\n● our ability to continue to successfully manage our websites on a combined basis;\n● security breaches, cybersecurity attacks and other significant disruptions in our information technology systems;\n● developments and changes in laws and regulations, including increased regulation of our industry through legislative action and revised rules and standards;\n● the occurrence of hostilities, political instability or catastrophic events and wars;\n● our ability to maintain the listing or trading of our common stock and warrants on the NASDAQ Capital Market and the potential impact on our business if we fail to\ndo so;\n● natural events such as severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes, or man-made or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures or equipment;\n● risks related to, and the costs associated with, environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters, including the scope and pace of related rulemaking activity;\n● other risks to which our Company is subject; and\n● other factors beyond the Company’s control.\nThe ultimate correctness of these forward-looking statements depends upon a number of known and unknown risks and events. We discuss our known material risks under Part I\nItem 1.A \"Risk Factors” contained in our Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II, Item 1.A \"Risk Factors” in this report on Form\n10-Q. Many factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business\nor the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.\nThe forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking\nstatement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n3\nTable of Contents\nITEM 1.

Assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at\nexchange rates at the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rate and revenues and expenses are translated by using the average exchange rates\nfor the period. Translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations and\ncomprehensive loss. Foreign currency denominated transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating those in effect at the transaction dates.\n8\nTable of Contents\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities – Equity and Cost Method Investments\nWe account for our interests in entities in which we are able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, generally 50% or less ownership interest, under\nthe equity method of accounting. In such cases, our original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of earnings, losses and distributions. We account for our\ninterests in entities where we have virtually no influence over operating and financial policies under the cost method of accounting. In such cases, our original investments are\nrecorded at the cost to acquire the interest and any distributions received are recorded as income. Our investments in Onfolio JV I, LLC (\"JV I”), Onfolio JV II, LLC (\"JV II”) and\nOnfolio JV III, LLC (\"JV III”) are accounted for under the cost method. All investments are subject to our impairment review policy. The Company recognized the value of its\ninvestments in these joint ventures at carryover basis based on the amount paid by the CEO to the joint venture for Onfolio JV 1 LLC, and agreed to pay the joint venture the\ncontribution for Onfolio JV II LLC and Onfolio JV III LLC at the carryover basis for the amount the interest was acquired for by the CEO.\nThe current investment in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method consists of a 35.8% interest in Onfolio JV IV, LLC (\"JV IV”), which is involved in the\nacquisition, development and operation of websites to produce advertising revenue. The initial value of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate accounted for under the equity\nmethod is recorded at the fair value of the consideration paid.\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities (\"VIEs”) are consolidated when the investor is the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the variable interest holder in a VIE with both the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Management concluded that the joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities under the requirements of ASC 810, as the joint\nventures 1) have sufficient equity to finance its activities; 2) have equity owners that as a group have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest in the business, through\nthe ability to vote on a majority basis to change the managing member of the respective joint ventures, and 3) are structured with substantive voting rights. The Company\naccounts for its investments in the joint ventures under either the cost or equity method based on the equity ownership in each entity.\nThe Company, through its subsidiary Onfolio Management LLC, is the manager of Onfolio Agency SPV, LLC (\"OA SPV”), and Onfolio Agency SPV 2, LLC (\"OA SPV 2”),\ncollectively referred to as \"OA SPVs”. The Company does not hold any equity interest in OA SPVs, but will receive 10% of any cash distributions paid by OA SPV, and 20% of any\ncash distributions paid by OA SPV 2, to its members, when declared, as the management fee. The Company can be removed as manager of OA SPVs through a unanimous vote of\nthe members. The Company determined that the fees it may receive for its role as manager do not constitute a variable interest in OA SPVs and will be accounted for as a revenue\ncontract under ASC 606.\nThe Company, through its subsidiary RevenueZen, LLC, is the manager of CliAquire, LLC (\"CliAquire”). The Company holds a 5% members interest in CliAquire and will receive\nprofit distributions based on its membership interest. The Company can be removed as manager of CliAquire through a supermajority vote of the members. The Company\ndetermined that the investment in CliAquire will be accounted for as a cost method investment.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The Company uses significant judgements when making estimates related to the\nassessment of control over variable interest entities, valuation of deferred tax assets and impairment of long lived assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalent\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits with banks and liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.\n9\nTable of Contents\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Company amortizes acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual\nimpairment tests. In accordance with ASC 360 \"Property Plant and Equipment,” the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived\nassets for impairment throughout the year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such\nassets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company follows the guidance of the FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to all contracts using the modified retrospective method.\nRevenue is recognized based on the following five step model:\n- Identification of the contract with a customer\n- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n- Determination of the transaction price\n- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n- Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company primarily earns revenue through website management, digital services, advertising and content placement on its online businesses, product sales, and digital\nproduct sales. Management services revenue is earned and recognized on a monthly basis as the services are provided. Advertising and content revenue is earned and recognized\nonce the content is presented on the Company’s sites in accordance with the customer requirements. Product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped to the\ncustomer. In certain circumstances, products are shipped directly by a supplier to the end customer at the Company’s request. The Company determined that it is the primary\nobligor in these contracts due to being responsible for fulfilling the customer contract, establishing pricing with the customer, and taking on credit risk from the customer. The\nCompany recognizes revenue from these contracts with customers on a gross basis. Digital product sales represent electronic content that is transferred to the customer at time of\npurchase. The Company also earns revenue from online course subscriptions that may have monthly or annual subscriptions. In circumstances when a customer purchases an\nannual subscription upfront, the Company defers the revenue until the performance obligation has been satisfied. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company\nhad $211,284 and $149,965, respectively, in deferred revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations that are expected to be recognized during the 12 months following\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nThe following table presented disaggregated revenue information for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nFor the Three Months ended For the Nine Months ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nWebsite management $ 24,000 $ 30,921 $ 72,000 $ 101,578\nAdvertising and content revenue 895,044 592,782 2,563,762 1,020,063\nProduct sales 117,234 179,764 445,511 488,254\nDigital Product Sales 975,494 509,844 2,244,000 2,365,193\nTotal revenue $ 2,011,772 $ 1,313,311 $ 5,325,273 $ 3,975,088\nThe Company does not have any single customer that accounted for greater than 10% of revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\n10\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nCost of product revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the acquisition and shipment of products being sold through the Company’s online marketplaces, and the\ncosts of its service revenue, which include website content creation costs including contract labor, domain and hosting costs and certain software costs related to website\noperations.\nCost of Service revenue consists primarily of costs associated with the acquisition and shipment of products being sold through the Company’s online marketplaces, and the costs\nof its service revenue, which include website content creation costs including contract labor, domain and hosting costs and certain software costs related to website operations.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share\nIn accordance with ASC 260 \"Earnings per Share,” basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss for the period by the weighted average number of common and common\nequivalent shares, including 412,250 stock options and 6,219,863 warrants, outstanding during the period. Such common equivalent shares have not been included in the\ncomputation of net loss per share as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, which requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and\nallows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred\ntaxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for\nincome tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their\nbenefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of short-term instruments, including cash, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and notes payable approximate fair value due to the relatively short period\nto maturity for these instruments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset\nor liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs\nand minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurements, defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\nThe Company does not have any assets or liabilities that are required to be measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.\n11\nTable of Contents\nStock-Based Compensation\nAccounting Standards Codification (\"ASC”) 718, \"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” established financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based\ncompensation plans. It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument. Accordingly, employee share-based payment\ncompensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. The valuation of employee\nstock options is an inherently subjective process, since market values are generally not available for long-term, non-transferable employee stock options. Accordingly, the Black-\nScholes option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value. The Black-Scholes pricing model requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of\nestimating fair value.\nExpected Dividends. - We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we use an\nexpected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant-date fair value of a stock option.\nExpected Volatility. - The expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of options granted. We\ndetermine the expected volatility solely based upon the historical volatility of a peer group of companies of similar size and with similar operations.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. - The risk-free interest rate is the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the option’s expected term on\nthe grant date.\nExpected Term. - The expected life of stock options granted is based on the actual vesting date and the end of the contractual term.\nStock Option Exercise Price and Grant Date Price of Common Stock. - Currently the Company utilizes the most recent cash sale closing price of its common stock as the most\nreasonable indication of fair value.\nThe Company accounts for compensation cost for stock option plans and for share based payments to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505, \"Accounting for Equity\nInstruments Issued to Non-Employees for Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services”. Share-based awards to non-employees are expensed over the period in\nwhich the related services are rendered at their fair value.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company manages its operations as a single segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision\nMaker (\"CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The CODM allocates resources and evaluates the performance of the Company at the consolidated level using information about\nits revenues, gross profit, income from operations, and other key financial data. All significant operating decisions are based upon an analysis of the Company as one operating\nsegment, which is the same as its reporting segment.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required for income taxes.\nThis ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendment should be applied on a prospective basis while\nretrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this pronouncement on its disclosures.\nNOTE 3 – GOING CONCERN\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will\nbe able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these\nfinancial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern. At September 30, 2024, the Company had not yet achieved consistent profitable operations and expects to incur further losses in the development of\nits business, all of which raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent\nupon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business\noperations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity\nor debt financing and/or related party advances. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.\n12\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 – BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nRevenueZen\nOn December 31, 2023, RevenueZen (the \"Acquired Business”) and the Company and RevenueZen LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (\"RevenueZen Delaware\") a\nsubsidiary of the Company, entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement (the \"RevenueZen Asset Purchase Agreement\"), for the purchase by the Company of the\nAcquired Business.\nPursuant to the RevenueZen Asset Purchase Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, at the closing, RevenueZen agreed to sell to the Company the\nAcquired Business, all as more fully described in the RevenueZen Asset Purchase Agreement.

SDE in this case is defined as gross revenue, less returns, discounts, and refunds\nand reduced by the cost of contractor payments, freelance copywriters, and payroll and benefits, consistent with the practices of the Seller in the operations of the Business, and\nfor the sake of clarity exclude any payments, reimbursements, administrative charges, overhead charges, or other payments of any kind to the Buyer, Holdings, or any affiliate\nthereof.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to\nimply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results\nin the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.

Through the acquisition and growth of a diversified group of websites with these characteristics, we believe we offer investors in our shares an opportunity\nto diversify their own portfolio risk.\nOnfolio Holdings Inc. was incorporated on July 20, 2020 under the laws of Delaware to acquire and develop high-growth and profitable websites. Unless the context otherwise\nrequires, all references to \"our Company,” \"we,” \"our” or \"us” and other similar terms means Onfolio Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation, and our wholly- and majority-owned\nsubsidiaries.\nThe first nine months of 2024 reflected significant improvements in our revenue, and net loss. Our cash used in operations for the nine months decreased to $696,715, marking the\nlowest use of cash for operating activities since our initial public offering in August 2022, compared to $2,160,796 during the same period in 2023.\nNotably, our net loss roughly halved year-over-year, improving from a net loss of $7,311,359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 (which included an impairment loss of\n$3,952,516), to a net loss of $1,909,993 in the same period of 2024.\nIn Q3, we saw further gains towards profitability, through increased organic revenue growth, expense reduction, and an acquisition (Eastern Standard, detailed in Recent\nDevelopments below) that will contribute to our revenue from Q4 onwards. Quarterly revenue rose 53% year-over-year year, and 16.5% quarter-over-quarter, while total loss from\noperations decreased to $485,478, down from $4,740,623 in Q3 2023 (which included the impairment loss described above) and $759,119 in Q2 2024.\nOperational improvements made in Q2 within several portfolio companies yielded substantial cost savings, with impacts most noticeable in August and September 2024. September\n2024 marked a milestone with revenues exceeding $700,000 for the first time, and while the net loss for the month was $352,714, non-cash expenses such as amortization made up\n$346,802 of this loss.\nMoving into Q4, the acquisition of Eastern Standard will contribute to our consolidated results. We continue to explore organic growth opportunities, operational efficiencies, and\nfurther accretive acquisitions assisted by OA SPVs (described in Note 2) and our joint-venture investors.\nWe continue to maintain a strong acquisition pipeline and are actively working towards completing these transactions.\nManagement remains committed to continuous improvement and achieving profitability by focusing on optimizing our financial position and completing accretive acquisitions.\nRecent Developments\nIn October 2024, we acquired Eastern Standard, a premier digital agency specializing in brand strategy, website development, and digital marketing.

In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain\naccounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our\nfinancial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (ii) the last day of the\nfirst fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more, (ii) the date that we become a \"large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act”), which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the\nlast business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding\nthree year period.\nPrincipal Factors Affecting Our Financial Performance\nOur operating results are primarily affected by the following factors at a portfolio company level:\n· our ability to acquire new customers or retain existing customers and grow revenue;\n· our ability to offer competitive product pricing and control expenses;\n23\nTable of Contents\n· our ability to broaden product offerings;\n· industry demand and competition;\n· our ability to leverage technology and use and develop efficient processes;\n· our ability to attract and retain talented employees;\n· our ability to identify and acquire companies at reasonable prices and terms;\n· our ability to reduce and control corporate overhead; and\n· market conditions and our market position.\nResults of Operations\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe Company reported a net loss of $497,759 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $4,733,159 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe components of the decrease in net loss for the current period are as follows:\nRevenues\nFor the Quarter Ended $ Change % Change\nSeptember 30, from prior from prior\n2024 2023 Year year\nRevenue, services $ 919,044 $ 433,490 $ 485,554 112%\nRevenue, product sales 1,092,728 879,821 212,907 24%\nTotal Revenue $ 2,011,772 $ 1,313,311 698,461 53%\nRevenue increased by $698,461, or 53% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to revenue from our RevenueZen\nacquisition completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 which increased revenue by approximately $621,000 and our DDS Rank acquisition completed at the end of the second\nquarter of fiscal 2024, which increased revenue by approximately $71,000. This increase was partially offset by a decline in website management revenue, and a decline in digital\nproduct sales within the Company’s Mighty Deals subsidiary and a decline in revenue from its SEO Butler subsidiary.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30, $ Change from % Change from\n2024 2023 prior year prior year\nCost of revenue, services $ 625,676 $ 218,063 $ 407,613 187%\nCost of revenue, product sales 180,421 247,533 (67,112) (27)%\nTotal Cost of Revenue 806,097 465,596 340,501 73%\nCost of revenue increased by $340,501, or 73% due to the Company’s recent acquisition offset by the decrease in digital product sales within the Company’s Mighty Deals\nsubsidiary. The Company’s gross profit margins decreased slightly in the current period compared to the prior period. The components most significant to the Company’s cost of\nrevenue are the costs of labor for service fulfillment, content creation, website hosting and maintenance costs and the costs of acquiring new inventory products for physical\nproduct sales.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative\nGeneral and Administrative expenses decreased by $58,267, or 4% during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a\ndecrease in advertising and marketing costs of $88,000, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $80,000 and decrease in contractor and compensation costs of\n$84,000, offset by an increase in other general and administrative costs of $44,000, including travel and merchant fees, and an increase in amortization expenses of $147,000\nassociated with the acquired intangible assets not present in the comparable period.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of consulting related expenses paid to contractors, stock-based compensation, advertising and marketing costs, and\nother expenses. In the near future, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase to support business growth. Over the long term, we expect general\nand administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nProfessional Fees and Acquisition Costs\nProfessional fees decreased by $22,471, or 10% during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreased legal and accounting costs\nassociated with the Company’s compliance requirements as a public company. The Company also incurred $18,979 in acquisition costs during the three months ended September\n30, 2024 compared to $77,525 during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which included due diligence, audit, legal and other professional fees related to acquisitions and\npotential acquisitions. We expect acquisition costs to remain significant as we continue to grow based on acquisitions.\nOther Income and expense\nTotal other expense was $12,281 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to other income of $7,464 during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The\ndecrease in other income was driven by lower equity method income and decrease in interest income from decreased cash balances.\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024 compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nThe Company reported a net loss of $1,909,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $7,311,359 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nThe components of the decrease in net loss for the current period are as follows:\nRevenues\nFor the Nine Months Ended $ Change % Change\nSeptember 30, from prior from prior\n2024 2023 Year year\nRevenue, services $ 2,635,761 $ 1,121,641 $ 1,514,120 135%\nRevenue, product sales 2,689,512 2,853,447 (163,935) (6)%\nTotal Revenue $ 5,325,273 $ 3,975,088 1,350,185 34%\nRevenue increased by $1,350,185, or 34% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023.

The Company’s gross profit margins remained about the same in the current period compared to the prior period despite the increase in agency service revenue due to\nthe Company’s efforts to streamline operations and create efficiencies. The components most significant to the Company’s cost of revenue are the costs of labor for service\nfulfillment, content creation, website hosting and maintenance costs and the costs of acquiring new inventory products for physical product sales.\nOperating Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative\nGeneral and Administrative expenses decreased by $408,268, or 9% during the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in\nadvertising and marketing costs of $332,000, and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $518,000, offset by a $30,000 increase in other general and administrative\ncosts including travel and merchant fees, an increase in amortization expense of $341,000 associated with the acquired intangible assets not present in the comparable period.\nContractor and payroll costs were flat compared to the prior period despite the overall increase in the business, as a result of the Company’s efficiency efforts.\nOur general and administrative expenses consist primarily of consulting related expenses paid to contractors, stock-based compensation, advertising and marketing costs, and\nother expenses. In the near future, we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase to support business growth. Over the long term, we expect general\nand administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nProfessional Fees and Acquisition Costs\nProfessional fees decreased by $248,854, or 29% during the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreased legal and accounting costs associated\nwith the Company’s compliance requirements as a public company. The Company also incurred $122,266 in acquisition costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024\ncompared to $285,532 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which included due diligence, audit, legal and other professional fees related to acquisitions and potential\nacquisitions. We expect acquisition costs to remain significant as we continue to grow based on acquisitions.\nOther Income and expense\nTotal other expense was $57,346 during the nine months September 30, 2024 compared to other income of $88,457 during the nine months September 30, 2023. The decrease in other\nincome was driven by lower equity method income and decrease in interest income from decreased cash balances.\n26\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $363,244 which was mainly on account of raising capital from sale of common\nstock and warrants in our IPO of $12,255,470. In addition, the Company has raised $600,000 pursuant to a private offering of Series A preferred stock, $618,000 in notes payable and\nrepaid $2,164,498 on its acquisition notes.\nOur Company’s recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operations and our need to raise additional funding to finance our operations raise substantial\ndoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, management and our auditor have concluded that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue\nas a going concern. Our audited financial statements contained in our Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and\nExchange Commission on April 1, 2024 were prepared on a going concern basis, and contemplated the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, and the future operating cash flows of the entity may not provide adequate resources to fund\nongoing cash requirements for the next twelve months. If sources of liquidity are not available or if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations during the next twelve\nmonths, we may be required to obtain additional sources of funds through additional operational improvements, capital market transactions, asset sales or financing from third\nparties, a combination thereof or otherwise. We cannot provide assurance that these additional sources of funds will be available or, if available, would have reasonable terms. If\nwe are unable to obtain sufficient funding, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to\ncontinue as a going concern.\nCash used in operating activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $696,715 and $2,160,796 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily from the\nincrease in revenues and decreased general and administrative costs as the Company expanded its operations through its business acquisitions in the past year.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $304,000 and $850,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used in investing activities was\nprimarily for the purchase of businesses in both periods and additional cost method investments.\nCash provided by financing activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities was $480,218 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash used in financing activities of $269,522 during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. During the 2024 period, we received $732,300 in proceeds from notes payable and we paid $234,596 in dividends to preferred stockholders and\nmade payments totaling $238,046 on notes payable. During the 2023 period, we paid $160,563 in dividends to preferred stockholders and made payments totaling $68,959 on notes\npayable.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following are the Company’s critical accounting policies:\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities – Equity and Cost Method Investments\nWe account for our interests in entities in which we are able to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, generally 50% or less ownership interest, under\nthe equity method of accounting. In such cases, our original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of earnings, losses and distributions. We account for our\ninterests in entities where we have virtually no influence over operating and financial policies under the cost method of accounting. In such cases, our original investments are\nrecorded at cost and any distributions received are recorded as income. Our investments in OnFolio JV I, LLC (\"JV I”), OnFolio JVII, LLC (\"JVII”) and OnFolio JVIII, LLC (\"JVIII”)\nare accounted for under the cost method. All investments are subject to our impairment review policy.\nThe current investment in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method consists of a 35.8% interest in OnFolio JV IV, LLC (\"JV IV”), which is involved in the\nacquisition, development and operation of websites to produce adverting revenue.\n27\nTable of Contents\nVariable Interest Entities\nVariable interest entities (\"VIEs”) are consolidated when the investor is the primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is the variable interest holder in a VIE with both the power to\ndirect the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses, or the right to receive benefits that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. Management concluded that the joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities under the requirements of ASC 810. The Company\naccounts for its investments in the joint ventures under either the cost or equity method based on the equity ownership in each entity.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company primarily earns revenue through website management, digital services, advertising and content placement on its websites, product sales, and digital product sales.\nManagement services revenue is earned and recognized on a monthly basis as the services are provided. Advertising and content revenue is earned and recognized once the\ncontent is presented on the Company's sites in accordance with the customer requirements. Product sales are recognized at the time the product is shipped to the customer. In\ncertain circumstances, products are shipped directly by a supplier to the end customer at the Company's request. The Company determined that it is the primary obligor in these\ncontracts due to being responsible for fulfilling the customer contract, establishing pricing with the customer, and taking on credit risk from the customer. The Company recognizes\nrevenue from these contracts with customers on a gross basis. Digital product sales represent electronic content that is transferred to the customer at time of purchase. The\nCompany also earns revenue from online course subscriptions that may have monthly or annual subscriptions. In circumstances when a customer purchases an annual\nsubscription upfront, the Company defers the revenue until the performance obligation has been satisfied.\nRevenue is recognized based on the following five step model:\n- Identification of the contract with a customer\n- Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n- Determination of the transaction price\n- Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n- Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nThe Company amortizes acquired definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but subject to annual\nimpairment tests.\nLong-lived Assets\nProperty and equipment are stated on the basis of historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Major renewals and improvements are capitalized, while minor replacements, maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations.\nIn accordance with ASC 360 \"Property Plant and Equipment,” the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles subject to amortization and long-lived assets for impairment at\nleast annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.\nRecoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such\nassets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair market value.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,\nrevenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nContractual commitments\nThe Company has entered into two asset purchase agreements which includes contingent earn-out payments based on specific performance criteria.\nBWPS Business Acquisition: The Company may be required to pay up to $60,000 to Hoang Huu Thinh, contingent upon the BWPS business meeting certain monthly gross\nrevenue targets within three years from the closing date. No earn-out payments have been made as of September 30, 2024. (See Note 10 for further details.)\nRevenueZen Acquisition: The Company may be obligated to pay up to $1,869,000 to the sellers of RevenueZen, contingent upon the business achieving a specified gross profit\nthreshold within one year. As of September 30, 2024, no earn-out payments have been made. (See Note 10 for further details.)\nAlso, see Note 11 – Subsequent Events for additional contractual commitments.\n28\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot applicable.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our \"disclosure controls and procedures” (as\ndefined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term \"disclosure\ncontrols and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that\ninformation required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods\nspecified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive officer\nand principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,\nmanagement recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls\nsystem are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Based on\nthe evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer has concluded that, based on such evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures were not\neffective due to the material weakness described below. However, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that,\nnotwithstanding the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all\nmaterial respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP.\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that exists as of September 30, 2024. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of\ndeficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not\nbe prevented or detected on a timely basis. We determined that we had a material weakness because, due to our small size, and our limited number of personnel, we did not have in\nplace an effective internal control environment with formal processes and procedures, including journal entry processing and review, to allow for a detailed review of accounting\ntransactions that would identify errors in a timely manner.\nNotwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we have concluded that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with\nGAAP.\nManagement’s Plan to Remediate the Material Weakness\nWith the oversight of senior management, management is working towards remediation of these weaknesses in 2024 including addition of accounting personnel and to evaluate\nand implement procedures that will strengthen our internal controls. While we believe these measures will remediate the material weakness identified and strengthen our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, there is no assurance that we will demonstrate sufficient improvement that the material weakness will be remediated. We are committed to\ncontinuing to improve our internal control processes and will continue to diligently review our financial reporting controls and procedures.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n29\nTable of Contents\nPART II — OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties\nand an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that will\nhave, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nIn addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K, as filed\nwith the SEC on April 1, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in this Form 10-Q and in our 2023 Form 10-K are\nnot the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect\nour business, financial condition or future results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected. We\nmay disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe were incorporated on July 20, 2020, and have conducted operations since May 2019. We have incurred operating losses and experienced negative cash flow since our\ninception. We incurred a net loss of $8,144,821 for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 1,909,993 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We anticipate that we will\ncontinue to incur operating losses through at least 2024.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from owning and/or managing our online businesses to achieve profitability. We expect to continue to make significant\noperating and capital expenditures for acquisitions of online businesses, technologies, or other assets; and for marketing, working capital and general corporate purposes. As a\nresult, we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve profitability. We cannot assure you that we will ever achieve profitability.\n30\nTable of Contents\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs described in Note 3 of our audited financial statements contained in our Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission on April 1, 2024, our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on our December 31, 2023 financial statements, expressing substantial doubt that we\ncan continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months after issuance of their report based on our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the\nnecessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to\naddress this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing, debt financing and/or related party advances, however there is no\nassurance of additional funding being available. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. If we cannot raise\nthe necessary capital to continue as a viable entity, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in\nus.\nWe can provide no assurances that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. Our forecast of the period of time through which our\ncurrent financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to support our general and administrative and acquisition activities are forward-looking\nstatements and involve risks and uncertainties.\nIf we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay or curtail potential website acquisitions, forego sales and marketing efforts, and\nforego potential attractive business opportunities. Unless we secure additional financing, we will be unable to continue to execute on our business plan.\nWe require additional capital to support our present business plans and our anticipated business growth, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at\nall, which would adversely affect our ability to operate.\nWe will require additional funds to further develop our business plan. Based on our current operating plans, we believe we need to make additional acquisitions of online\nbusinesses, technologies, or other assets to generate enough cashflow to carry our overhead costs. We may choose to raise additional capital in order to expedite and propel\ngrowth more rapidly. We can give no assurance that we will be successful in raising any additional funds. Additionally, if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from our\nsales and operating activities, we may need to raise additional funds, doing so through debt and equity offerings, in order to meet our expected future liquidity and capital\nrequirements, including capital required for operations. Any such financing that we undertake will likely be dilutive to current stockholders.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth, including acquiring additional online businesses. In addition, we may also need additional funds to\nrespond to other business opportunities and challenges, including our ongoing operating expenses, protecting our intellectual property, satisfying debt and series A preferred\nstock payment obligations, and enhancing our operating infrastructure. While we may need to seek additional funding for such purposes, we may not be able to obtain financing\non acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of our financings may be dilutive to, or otherwise adversely affect, holders of our common stock. We may also seek to raise\nadditional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. We may not be able to negotiate any such arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are\nunable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis, we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all our business plans.\nWe cannot predict our future capital needs and we may not be able to secure additional financing.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our working capital needs and to fund further expansion of our business. We may require additional equity or debt\nfinancings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or funds from other sources for these purposes. No assurance can be given that necessary funds will be available\nfor us to finance our development on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, such additional financings may involve substantial dilution of our stockholders or may require that we\nrelinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. In addition, we may experience operational difficulties and delays due to working capital restrictions. If adequate funds\nare not available from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay or scale back our growth plans.\nWe may not be able to maintain a listing of our common stock and publicly-traded warrants on Nasdaq.\nAlthough our common stock and publicly-traded warrants are listed on Nasdaq, we must meet certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we violate Nasdaq’s\nlisting requirements, or if we fail to meet any of Nasdaq’s listing standards, our common stock and publicly-traded warrants may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may\ndetermine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock and publicly-traded\nwarrants from Nasdaq may materially impair our shareholders’ ability to buy and sell our common stock and publicly-traded warrants and could have an adverse effect on the\nmarket price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock and warrants. The delisting of our common stock and publicly-traded warrants could significantly\nimpair our ability to raise capital and the value of your investment.\n31\nTable of Contents\nITEM 2.
