(Nasdaq: LASR), a leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers used in the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets, today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\n\"Driven by record results in Aerospace & Defense, third quarter revenue of $56.1 million was above the midpoint of our guidance range and increased 11% compared to the third quarter of 2023,” commented Scott Keeney, nLIGHT’s President & Chief Executive Officer. “Strong execution across multiple programs in both directed energy and laser sensing resulted in record Aerospace & Defense product revenue during the quarter, and we remain well-positioned for near- and long-term growth in the Aerospace & Defense market.” \n\nMr. Keeney continued, “A strong growth quarter in Microfabrication coupled with higher A&D products revenue enabled us to increase products gross margin to 29%, an improvement of approximately 500 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2023. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $107 million in cash and investments with no debt.” \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n**(In thousands, except percentages)** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **% Change**  \nRevenues  |  $  |  56,129  |  $  |  50,634  |  10.9  |  %   \nGross margin  |  22.4  |  %  |  19.6  |  %   \nLoss from operations  |  $  |  (11,799  |  )  |  $  |  (12,531  |  )  |  5.8  |  %   \nOperating margin  |  (21.0  |  )%  |  (24.7  |  )%   \nNet loss  |  $  |  (10,335  |  )  |  $  |  (11,879  |  )  |  13.0  |  %   \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) |  $  |  (994  |  )  |  $  |  (1,919  |  )  |  NM*   \nAdjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenues  |  (1.8  |  )%  |  (3.8  |  )%   \n(1)  A reconciliation of the non-GAAP metrics presented here to the most directly comparable GAAP metric has been provided in the tables included at the end of this release.   \n* Not meaningful   \n  \nRevenues of $56.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 were up 10.9% compared to $50.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 22.4% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.6% for the third quarter of 2023. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $11.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP metrics presented here to the most directly comparable GAAP metric have been provided in the tables included at the end of this release. \n\n**Outlook**\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, nLIGHT expects revenues to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million. The midpoint of $51.5 million includes Laser Products revenue of approximately $36.5 million and Advanced Development revenue of approximately $15 million. nLIGHT expects overall gross margin to be in the range of 17% to 21%, with Laser Products gross margin in the range of 21% to 25% and Advanced Development gross margin of approximately 8%. nLIGHT expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of ($5) million to ($2) million. \n\nWe have not reconciled our outlook for Adjusted EBITDA because unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted nor can the probable significance be determined at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. \n\n**Investor Conference Call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Thursday, November 7, 2024**\n\nParties interested in listening to nLIGHT’s quarterly conference call may do so by dialing 1-800-579-2543 (U.S., toll-free) or +1-785-424-1789 (international and toll), with the conference title: nLIGHT Third Quarter 2024 Earnings. The call can also be accessed via the web by going to nLIGHT’s Investor Relations page at [http://investors.nlight.net](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.nlight.net&esheet=54149103&newsitemid=20241107730057&lan=en-US&anchor=http%3A%2F%2Finvestors.nlight.net&index=1&md5=cf4e4270776cd6a000f53b2f99df4c3d). \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release contains non-GAAP financial results, including Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted. We use Adjusted EBITDA to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of performance as it is commonly utilized by us and the investment community to analyze operating performance in our industry. Similarly, we believe that providing non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is useful to our investors as they present an informative supplemental view of our results from period to period by removing the effect of stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring items. However, the non-GAAP metrics presented herein are specific to us and may not be comparable to similar metrics disclosed by other companies because of differing methods used by other companies in calculating them. \n\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), other non-operating income or expense, interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based compensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the respective period plus the dilutive effect of any common stock equivalents during the period in the case of non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted. \n\nTables presenting the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, are included at the end of this press release. \n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nCertain statements in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “outlook,” “guidance,” “expects,” “intends,” “projects,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “targets,” “anticipates,” and similar expressions may identify these forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expected revenues, gross margin, and Adjusted EBITDA, and our business strategy and ability to profitably grow our business, as well as any other statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions, which may not prove to be accurate. These statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements, including but not limited to our ability to compete successfully in the markets for our products; changes in the markets we serve or in the global economy; our ability to increase our volumes and decrease our costs to offset potential declines in the average selling prices of our products; rapid technological changes in the markets that we participate in; our ability to develop and maintain products that can achieve market acceptance; our ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability in the future; our high levels of fixed costs and inventory and their effect on our gross profits and results of operations if demand for our products declines or we maintain excess inventory levels; our ability to manage growth and spending during economic downturns; our manufacturing capacity and operations and their suitability for future levels of demand; our reliance on third parties to manufacture certain of our products and product components; our reliance on a small number of customers for a significant portion of our revenues; our ability to manage risks associated with international customers and operations; the effect of government export and import controls on our ability to compete in international markets; our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights; fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other operating measures; and the effect on our business of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, other legal or regulatory proceedings, or commercial or contractual disputes that we are or may become involved in. Additional information concerning these and other factors can be found in nLIGHT's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including other risks, relevant factors and uncertainties identified in the “Risk Factors” section of nLIGHT's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K or subsequent filings with the SEC. nLIGHT undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments, except as required by law. \n\nThe nLIGHT logo and “nLIGHT” are registered trademarks or trademarks of nLIGHT, Inc. in various jurisdictions. \n\n**About nLIGHT**\n\nnLIGHT, Inc. is a leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers for industrial, microfabrication, aerospace and defense applications.

(Nasdaq: LASR), a leading provider of high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers used in the industrial, microfabrication, aerospace, and defense markets, today announces the production launch of the Corona AFX-2000, a two-kilowatt laser with proprietary beam shaping technology proven to significantly boost productivity in laser powder bed fusion processes for metal additive manufacturing. \n\nThe AFX-2000 has undergone successful commercial validation with a leading customer supporting the aerospace, defense, and automotive end markets. Using aluminum alloys, this customer is now achieving print speeds up to three times faster when compared to today’s leading large-format printers. \n\nUsing dynamic laser beam shaping, the AFX-2000 can successfully deliver twice the amount of available power compared to current state-of-the-art lasers while maintaining a stable process. The increased power that AFX-2000 provides results in higher productivity and lower cost per part, while maintaining the stability needed to produce high quality parts. \n\n“The exclusive beam profiles of the AFX-2000 have brought L-PBF print speeds to exciting new levels while maintaining precision, control and material quality for laser powder bed fusion,” said Rob Martinsen, Chief Technology Officer of nLIGHT. “The dynamic beam shaping technology in these lasers allows for productivity-optimized switching between profiles ideal for fine-scale features and contour exposures, to extremely fast and highly reproduceable build rates using ring beam profiles, making it the most versatile and efficient laser available for metal AM. We anticipate the AFX-2000 to be widely adopted for highly reflective alloys such as aluminum and copper, materials that benefit greatly from stable, high-brightness laser processing. The AFX-2000 will enable our customers to meaningfully reduce part costs for high-volume manufacturing.” \n\nNow in production, the AFX-2000 is offered in nLIGHT’s modulus™ platform, an integrated multi-laser sub-system designed for ultra-high-productivity laser powder bed fusion printers. The feature-rich modulus platform greatly simplifies the integration, control, and serviceability of multi-laser printers, while enabling new levels of machine utilization and reproducibility of production parts. \n\nnLIGHT will be unveiling the AFX-2000 at the leading global additive manufacturing trade fair Formnext, in Frankfurt, Germany, 19 – 22 November. As part of the event, nLIGHT is hosting a multi-day _Powered by Beam Shaping_ seminar series with speakers from industry-leading OEMs such as 3D Systems, Aconity3D, AMCM, DMG Mori USA, EOS, and Nikon SLM Solutions. The series will highlight new use cases across several markets being enabled today by nLIGHT’s Corona AFX beam shaping technology.

(Nasdaq: LASR), a leading provider of high-power\nsemiconductor and fiber lasers used in the industrial, microfabrication, and aerospace and defense markets, today\nreported financial results for the third quarter of 2024.\n\"Driven by record results in Aerospace & Defense, third quarter revenue of $56.1 million was above the midpoint of\nour guidance range and increased 11% compared to the third quarter of 2023,” commented Scott Keeney, nLIGHT’s\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer. “Strong execution across multiple programs in both directed energy and laser\nsensing resulted in record Aerospace & Defense product revenue during the quarter, and we remain well-positioned\nfor near- and long-term growth in the Aerospace & Defense market.”\nMr. Keeney continued, “A strong growth quarter in Microfabrication coupled with higher A&D products revenue\nenabled us to increase products gross margin to 29%, an improvement of approximately 500 basis points compared\nto the third quarter of 2023. Our balance sheet remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately $107\nmillion in cash and investments with no debt.”\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(In thousands, except percentages) 2024 2023 % Change\nRevenues $ 56,129 $ 50,634 10.9 %\nGross margin 22.4 % 19.6 %\nLoss from operations $ (11,799) $ (12,531) 5.8 %\nOperating margin (21.0) % (24.7) %\nNet loss $ (10,335) $ (11,879) 13.0 %\nAdjusted EBITDA(1) $ (994) $ (1,919) NM*\nAdjusted EBITDA, as a percentage of revenues (1.8) % (3.8) %\n(1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP metrics presented here to the most directly comparable GAAP metric has been provided in the tables\nincluded at the end of this release.\n* Not meaningful\nRevenues of $56.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 were up 10.9% compared to $50.6 million for the third\nquarter of 2023. Gross margin was 22.4% for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 19.6% for the third quarter of\n2023. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.3 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to net\nloss of $11.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Non-GAAP net loss for the third quarter\nof 2024 was $3.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.10 per\ndiluted share, for the third quarter of 2023. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP metrics presented here to the most\ndirectly comparable GAAP metric have been provided in the tables included at the end of this release.\nOutlook\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, nLIGHT expects revenues to be in the range of $49 million to $54 million. The\nmidpoint of $51.5 million includes Laser Products revenue of approximately $36.5 million and Advanced\nDevelopment revenue of approximately $15 million. nLIGHT expects overall gross margin to be in the range of 17%\nto 21%, with Laser Products gross margin in the range of 21% to 25% and Advanced Development gross margin of\napproximately 8%. nLIGHT expects Adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of ($5) million to ($2) million.\nWe have not reconciled our outlook for Adjusted EBITDA because unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains\nand losses cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted nor can the probable significance be determined at this\ntime. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort.\nInvestor Conference Call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Thursday, November 7, 2024\nParties interested in listening to nLIGHT’s quarterly conference call may do so by dialing 1-800-579-2543 (U.S., toll-\nfree) or +1-785-424-1789 (international and toll), with the conference title: nLIGHT Third Quarter 2024 Earnings.\nThe call can also be accessed via the web by going to nLIGHT’s Investor Relations page at http://\ninvestors.nlight.net.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Results\nIn addition to U.S. GAAP results, this press release contains non-GAAP financial results, including Adjusted\nEBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted. We use\nAdjusted EBITDA to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our\nbusiness, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. In addition to our results determined in\naccordance with GAAP, we believe Adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful measure of performance as it is commonly\nutilized by us and the investment community to analyze operating performance in our industry. Similarly, we believe\nthat providing non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, is useful\nto our investors as they present an informative supplemental view of our results from period to period by removing\nthe effect of stock-based compensation expense and other non-recurring items. However, the non-GAAP metrics\npresented herein are specific to us and may not be comparable to similar metrics disclosed by other companies\nbecause of differing methods used by other companies in calculating them.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax expense (benefit), other non-operating\nincome or expense, interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation,\nacquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-recurring items as determined by management, as\napplicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) as GAAP net income (loss) adjusted for stock-based\ncompensation, amortization of purchased intangibles, acquisition and integration-related costs, and other non-\nrecurring items as determined by management, as applicable. We define non-GAAP net income (loss) per share,\nbasic and diluted, as non-GAAP net income (loss) divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding\nduring the respective period plus the dilutive effect of any common stock equivalents during the period in the case of\nnon-GAAP net income (loss) per share, diluted.\nTables presenting the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to non-\nGAAP net income (loss) and GAAP to non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, basic and diluted, are included at the\nend of this press release.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements in this release are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Pronouncements\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of nLIGHT, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The unaudited financial information reflects, in the opinion of management, all adjustments\nnecessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the interim periods presented.\nThe results reported for the interim period presented are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year. These\nconsolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur critical accounting policies have not materially changed during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from those disclosed in our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)6 (cid:0)8 (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:26)\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-07, Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We will adopt ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of 2024 using a retrospective\ntransition method. We are\ncurrently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.\n(cid:0)$ (cid:0)6 (cid:0)8 (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:21) (cid:0)(cid:22) (cid:0)(cid:16)(cid:0)(cid:19) (cid:0)(cid:28)\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU requires enhanced jurisdictional and\nother disaggregated disclosures for the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid and is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024. This ASU requires additional disclosures and, accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a\nmaterial effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNote 2 - Revenue\nWe recognize revenue upon transferring control of products and services and the amounts recognized reflect the consideration we expect to be\nentitled to receive in exchange for these products and services. We consider customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by\nmaster sales agreements, to be the contracts with a customer. As part of our consideration of the contract, we evaluate certain factors, including\nthe customer's ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, we consider the promise to transfer products, each of which is distinct, as the\nidentified performance obligations.\nWe allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Master sales agreements or purchase\norders from customers could include a single product or multiple products. Regardless, the contracted price with the customer is agreed to at the\nindividual product level outlined in the customer contract or purchase order. We do not bundle prices; however, we do negotiate with customers\non pricing for the same products based on a variety of factors (e.g., level of contractual volume). We have concluded that the prices negotiated\nwith each individual customer are representative of the stand-alone selling price of the product.\nWe often receive orders with multiple delivery dates that may extend across several reporting periods. We allocate the transaction price of the\ncontract to each delivery based on the product standalone selling price and invoice for each scheduled delivery upon shipment or delivery and\nrecognize revenues for such delivery at that point, when transfer of control has occurred. As scheduled delivery dates are generally within one\nyear, under the optional exemption provided by ASC 606-10-50-14a, revenues allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are\nnot disclosed as performance obligations for point in time revenue. Further, we recognize, over time, revenue as per ASC 606-10-55-18 (invoice\npractical expedient) for our cost plus contracts and, accordingly, elect not to disclose\n7\nTable of Contents\ninformation related to those performance obligations under ASC 606-10-50-14b. As of September 30, 2024, we had $10 million of performance\nobligations relating to firm fixed price contracts that did not qualify for the aforementioned disclosure exemptions. We expect to recognize 50% of\nthese performance obligations by the end of 2024 and the remainder by the end of 2025.\nRights of return generally are not included in customer contracts. Accordingly, product revenue is recognized upon transfer of control at shipment\nor delivery, as applicable. Rights of return are evaluated as they occur.\nRevenues recognized at a point in time consist of sales of semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers and other related products. Revenues recognized\nover time generally consist of development arrangements that are structured based on our costs incurred. For long-term contracts, we estimate\nthe total expected costs to complete the contract and recognize revenue based on the percentage of costs incurred at period end. Typically,\nrevenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward\nsatisfying our performance obligations. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer\nof control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, materials, subcontractors costs, other direct costs, and indirect costs applicable on\ngovernment and commercial contracts.\nContract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that may span several\nyears. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of\nmaterials, the performance of subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Billing under these arrangements\ngenerally occurs within one month of the costs being incurred or as milestones are reached.\nThe following tables represent a disaggregation of revenue from contracts with customers for the periods presented (in thousands):\n(cid:0)6 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)U(cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)W\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nIndustrial $ 11,588 $ 19,607 $ 36,478 $ 56,078\nMicrofabrication 14,263 12,000 35,276 37,285\nAerospace and Defense 30,278 19,027 79,413 64,666\n$ 56,129 $ 50,634 $ 151,167 $ 158,029\n(cid:0)6 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)* (cid:0)H (cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)U(cid:0)D (cid:0)S (cid:0)K (cid:0)\\\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNorth America $ 36,332 $ 31,330 $ 100,696 $ 94,750\nChina 2,371 2,624 8,877 9,134\nRest of World 17,426 16,680 41,594 54,145\n$ 56,129 $ 50,634 $ 151,167 $ 158,029\n(cid:0)6 (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)V (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)E (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)7 (cid:0)L(cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)I(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)5 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)X (cid:0)H\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nPoint in time $ 41,070 $ 37,913 $ 105,062 $ 117,361\nOver time 15,059 12,721 46,105 40,668\n$ 56,129 $ 50,634 $ 151,167 $ 158,029\n8\nTable of Contents\nOur contract assets and liabilities were as follows (in thousands):\nAs of\nBalance Sheet\nClassification September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPrepaid expenses and\nContract assets other current assets $ 8,802 $ 7,298\nDeferred revenues and other\nContract liabilities long-term liabilities 5,769 6,368\nContract assets generally consist of revenue recognized on an over-time basis where revenue recognition has been met, but the amounts are\nbilled and collected in a subsequent period. In our services contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon\ncontractual terms, either at periodic intervals, which is generally monthly, or upon the achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, billing\noccurs subsequent to revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. However, we sometimes receive advances or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized,\nresulting in contract liabilities recorded in deferred revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities are not a significant\nfinancing component as they are generally utilized to pay for contract costs within a one-year period or are used to ensure the customer meets\ncontractual requirements. These assets and liabilities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the\nend of each reporting period. For our product revenue, we generally receive cash payments subsequent to satisfying the performance obligation\nvia delivery of the product, resulting in billed accounts receivable. For our contracts, there are no significant gaps between the receipt of payment\nand the transfer of the associated goods and services to the customer for material amounts of consideration.\nDuring the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of $43 thousand and $4.3 million that was included in the\ndeferred revenues balance at the beginning of the period as the performance obligations under the associated agreements were satisfied.\nNote 3 - Concentrations of Credit and Other Risks\nThe following customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenues for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nU.S. Government* 12% 16% 15% 17%\nRaytheon Technologies (1) (1) 10% (1)\nKORD Technologies 19% (1) 14% (1)\n*Excludes sales to customers who sell our products and services exclusively to the U.S. Government\n(1) Represents less than 10% of total revenues.\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of receivables from customers. As\nof September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, two customers accounted for a total of 22% and 24%, respectively, of net customer receivables.\nNo other customers accounted for 10% or more of net customer receivables at either date.\nNote 4 - Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with original maturities of greater than 90 days when purchased. Our\nmarketable securities are considered available-for-sale as they represent investments that are available to be sold for current operations. As\nsuch, they are included as current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in\naccumulated other comprehensive loss. Any unrealized gains and losses that are considered to be other-than-temporary are recorded in other\nincome, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using\nthe specific-identification method and recorded in other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRealized gains were $1.1 million and $2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Unrealized losses\nwere $0.2 million and immaterial for the three and nine months ended September\n9\nTable of Contents\n30, 2024, respectively. These unrealized gains are considered temporary and are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nLoss. Realized gains were $0.8 million and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Unrealized gains\nwere immaterial for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nSee Note 5 for additional information.\nNote 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are shown at cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these\ninstruments. The fair value of our term and revolving loans approximates the carrying value due to the variable market rate used to calculate\ninterest payments.\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation\ntechniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard\ndescribes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that\nmay be used to measure fair value which are the following:\n• Level 1 Inputs: Observable inputs, such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the\nmeasurement date.\n• Level 2 Inputs: Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities,\nquoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for\nsubstantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n• Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets\nor liabilities.\nOur financial instruments that are carried at fair value consist of Level 1 assets which include highly liquid investments and bank drafts classified\nas cash equivalents and marketable securities.\nOur fair value hierarchy for our financial instruments was as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2024\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash Equivalents:\nMoney market securities $ 20,189 $ — $ — $ 20,189\nCommercial paper 2,446 — — 2,446\n22,635 — — 22,635\nMarketable Securities:\nU.S. treasuries 65,241 — — 65,241\nTotal $ 87,876 $ — $ — $ 87,876\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash Equivalents:\nMoney market securities $ 22,441 $ — $ — $ 22,441\nCommercial paper 1,995 — — 1,995\n24,436 — — 24,436\nMarketable Securities:\nU.S. treasuries 59,672 — — 59,672\nTotal $ 84,108 $ — $ — $ 84,108\n10\nTable of Contents\n(cid:0)& (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)K (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)( (cid:0)T (cid:0)X (cid:0)L(cid:0)Y (cid:0)D (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nThe fair value of cash equivalents is determined based on quoted market prices for similar or identical securities.\n(cid:0)0 (cid:0)D (cid:0)U (cid:0)N (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)L(cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)H (cid:0)V\nWe classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale and value them utilizing a market approach that uses observable inputs without\napplying significant judgment.\nNote 6 - Inventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of average cost (principally standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) and net\nrealizable value. Inventory includes raw materials and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to obsolescence. On a\nquarterly basis, we review inventory quantities on hand in comparison to our past consumption, recent purchases, and other factors to determine\nwhat inventory quantities, if any, may not be sellable. Based on this analysis, we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess\nand obsolescence charges. At the point of loss recognition, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in\nfacts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\nInventory consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nRaw materials $ 20,278 $ 23,426\nWork in process and semi-finished goods 22,113 19,640\nFinished goods 6,437 9,094\n$ 48,828 $ 52,160\nNote 7 - Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):\nUseful life As of\n(years) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAutomobiles 3 $ 518 $ 109\nComputer hardware and software 3 - 5 16,037 9,145\nManufacturing and lab equipment 2 - 7 85,964 91,050\nOffice equipment and furniture 5 - 7 4,990 2,634\nLeasehold and building improvements 2 - 12 30,937 31,988\nBuildings 30 9,392 9,392\nLand N/A 3,399 3,399\n151,237 147,717\nAccumulated depreciation (103,348) (95,417)\n$ 47,889 $ 52,300\n11\nTable of Contents\nNote 8 - Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n(cid:0),(cid:0)Q (cid:0)W(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)J (cid:0)L(cid:0)E (cid:0)O(cid:0)H (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)$ (cid:0)V (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)W(cid:0)V\nThe details of definite lived intangible assets were as follows (in thousands):\nEstimated useful\nAs of\nlife\n(in years) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nPatents 3 - 5 $ — $ 6,345\nDevelopment programs 2 - 4 7,200 7,200\nDeveloped technology 5 2,959 2,959\n10,159 16,504\nAccumulated amortization (9,178) (14,852)\n$ 981 $ 1,652\nAmortization related to intangible assets was as follows (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmortization expense $ 149 $ 633 $ 671 $ 1,896\nEstimated amortization expense for future years is as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 149\n2025 484\n2026 348\nThereafter —\n$ 981\n(cid:0)* (cid:0)R (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)Z (cid:0)L(cid:0)O(cid:0)O\nThe carrying amount of goodwill by segment was as follows (in thousands):\nAdvanced\nLaser Products Development Totals\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 2,151 $ 10,248 $ 12,399\nCurrency exchange rate adjustment 9 — 9\nBalance, September 30, 2024 $ 2,160 $ 10,248 $ 12,408\nNote 9 - Accrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nAs of\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nAccrued payroll and benefits $ 10,497 $ 7,898\nProduct warranty, current 2,440 3,339\nOther accrued expenses 1,204 1,319\n$ 14,141 $ 12,556\nNote 10 - Product Warranties\nWe provide warranties on certain products and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims at the time\nrevenue is recognized.

Headquartered in Camas, Washington, we design, develop, and manufacture the critical elements of our lasers, and believe our\nvertically integrated business model enables us to rapidly introduce innovative products, control our costs and protect our intellectual property.\nWe operate in two reportable segments—Laser Products and Advanced Development —and we serve three primary end-markets—Industrial,\nMicrofabrication, and Aerospace and Defense. Sales of our semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and other directed energy laser\nproducts are included in the Laser Products segment, while revenue earned from research and development contracts are included in the\nAdvanced Development segment.\nRevenues decreased to $151.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $158.0 million in the same period of 2023\ndue primarily to decreased sales in the Laser Products segment. We generated a net loss of $35.8 million for the nine months ended September\n30, 2024 compared to a net loss of $28.4 million for the same period of 2023.\n17\nTable of Contents\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\n(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)I(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)R (cid:0)X (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)H (cid:0)P (cid:0)L(cid:0)F (cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)R (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)) (cid:0)L(cid:0)E (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)/ (cid:0)D (cid:0)V (cid:0)H (cid:0)U (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)6 (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)X (cid:0)W(cid:0)L(cid:0)R (cid:0)Q (cid:0)V\nOur revenue growth depends on market demand and achievement of design wins for our semiconductor and fiber lasers. We consider a design\nwin to occur when a customer notifies us that it has selected one of our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development\nby such customer. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by customers in the Industrial\nand Microfabrication markets, which, in turn, depend upon the demand for these customers’ products or services. In addition, in the Aerospace\nand Defense market, our business depends in large part on continued investment in laser technology by the U.S. government and its allies, and\nour ability to continue to successfully develop leading technology in this area and commercialize that technology in the future.\nDemand for our products also fluctuates based on market cycles, continuously evolving industry supply chains, trade and tariff terms, as well as\nevolving competitive dynamics in each of our end-markets. Erosion of average selling prices, or ASPs, of established products is typical in our\nindustry, and the ASPs of our products generally decrease as our products mature. We may also negotiate discounted selling prices from time to\ntime with certain customers that purchase higher volumes, or to penetrate new markets or applications. Historically, we have been able to offset\ndecreasing ASPs by introducing new and higher value products, increasing the sales of our existing products, expanding into new applications\nand reducing our product and manufacturing costs. Although we anticipate further increases in product volumes and the continued introduction\nof new and higher value products, ASP reduction may cause our revenues to decline or grow at a slower rate.\n(cid:0)7 (cid:0)H (cid:0)F (cid:0)K (cid:0)Q (cid:0)R (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)J (cid:0)\\ (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)D (cid:0)Q (cid:0)G (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)1 (cid:0)H (cid:0)Z (cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)3 (cid:0)U (cid:0)R (cid:0)G (cid:0)X (cid:0)F (cid:0)W(cid:0)(cid:3)(cid:0)’ (cid:0)H (cid:0)Y (cid:0)H (cid:0)O(cid:0)R (cid:0)S (cid:0)P (cid:0)H (cid:0)Q (cid:0)W\nWe invest heavily in the development of our semiconductor, fiber laser, directed energy, and laser-sensing technologies to provide solutions to\nour current and future customers. We anticipate that we will continue to invest in research and development to achieve our technology and\nproduct roadmap. Our product development is targeted to specific sectors of the market where we believe the performance of our products\nprovides a significant benefit to our customers.

Our product sales mix can affect gross profits due to variations in profitability related to product configurations\nand cost profiles, customer volume pricing, availability of competitive products in various markets, and new product introductions, among other\nfactors. We have invested heavily in U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities in the last several years. Capacity utilization affects our gross margin\nbecause we have a high fixed cost base due to our vertically integrated business model. Increases in sales and production volumes drive\nfavorable absorption of fixed costs, improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower production costs. Gross margins may fluctuate from period to\nperiod depending on product mix and the level of capacity utilization.\nOur Advanced Development gross profit varies with the type and terms of contracts, contract volume, project mix, changes in the estimated cost\nof projects at completion, and successful execution on projects during the period.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, reference is made to Item 7A, “Quantitative\nand Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” contained in Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOur exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2023.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, have evaluated our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on\nthat evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were, in design and operation, effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that\nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Internal Control\nControl systems, including ours, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the\ncontrol systems’ objectives are being met. Further, the design of any control systems must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,\nand the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation\nof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These\ninherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error\nor mistake. Control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by\nmanagement override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, on certain assumptions about the likelihood of\nfuture events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over\ntime, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures. We intend to continue to monitor and upgrade our internal controls as necessary or appropriate for our business, but cannot assure\nyou that such improvements will be sufficient to provide us with effective internal control over financial reporting.\n26\nTable of Contents\nPART II—OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.
