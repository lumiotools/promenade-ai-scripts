(“Checkpoint”) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate updates.\n\n“With the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date set for next month, we await the decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our anti-programmed death ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) antibody,” said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. “The $9.2 million in cash proceeds received this month from the exercise of existing warrants has strengthened our balance sheet to extend beyond our PDUFA date and into 2025. We are now fully focused on preparing for the potential approval of cosibelimab and look forward to potentially offering oncologists a new, differentiated treatment option for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”).”\n\n**Recent Corporate Updates:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint announced that the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab as a complete response to the complete response letter (“CRL”) issued in December 2023 and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab, its anti-PD-L1 antibody with dual mechanism of action, with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint completed a registered direct offering priced At-the-Market under Nasdaq rules and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million.\n  * In September 2024, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from its pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses. A copy of the ESMO poster can be found on the [Publications page](https://checkpointtx.com/publications/ \"Opens in a new window\") of Checkpoint’s website.\n  * In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.7 million, compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million for the quarter and a decrease of $0.2 million, year-to-date. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n  * **R &D Expenses**: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.4 million, compared to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $0.9 million.

(“Checkpoint”) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced the presentation of longer-term data from its pivotal trial of cosibelimab, its anti-programmed death ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) antibody, in locally advanced and metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”) during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024, which is taking place in Barcelona, Spain, from September 13 to 17, 2024.\n\n**Poster Presentation Title:**[Cosibelimab in Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (CSCC): Longer-term Efficacy and Safety Results from Pivotal Study](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=5z6lWZQbG5u5a_CvZTcLa-QiIdeSIfsXS9dPqF5aCTNnrbplI9AhydTVtyV6js2pAsHFbwdn-V5OZ2t1dB5Gl8YX8ZN_UPqkPPY59KaB19ozaVMUQHeZDA7QywAPSdvlzv276bWXLRfIX6dpxYn_U7ogxfjOWF4F4Nz60k6LMh7415W-jMCM-0W-JrrOjrZansA5SESxGKrBs5yB8yoR2_eiITCraOSXmllMec04pT6P7d6SaK18cuTC-SmfgPBrK1YEn4WPqNkeJVVKjChlqjwzgK5p7Dc6gVlFrDWyh2SnqRQysvftrKNoDgDIY5fh \"Opens in a new window\")\n\n“These longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses, and continue to expand the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of cosibelimab as a potential new treatment for advanced cSCC,” said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. “We look forward to our upcoming December 28, 2024, Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date for our Biologics License Application for cosibelimab, and believe, if approved, cosibelimab’s dual mechanisms of action and safety profile may position the product, over time, as the preferred immunotherapy of U.S. oncologists.”\n\n**Data highlights include:**\n\n**Efficacy**\n\n  * With 16 months of additional follow-up since the primary analysis, cosibelimab demonstrated increasing objective response rates (“ORRs”) and complete response rates per independent central review in 109 patients with advanced cSCC. \n    * ORRs of 54.8% and 50.0% achieved in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC, with median follow-up durations of 24.1 and 29.3 months, respectively.\n    * Results demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with complete response rates of 25.8% and 12.8% in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC, respectively.\n    * Clinically meaningful durations of response (“DOR”) were observed, with median DORs not yet reached in either group.\n\n\n\n**Safety**\n\n  * Overall, in 192 advanced cSCC patients treated with cosibelimab, a manageable safety profile was observed, with notable low rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”), severe immune-related adverse events (“irAEs”), and treatment discontinuations. \n    * 3.6% of patients experienced an irAE assessed as grade 3, with no observed grade ≥4 irAEs.\n    * No events of grade ≥3 pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis, or endocrinopathies.\n    * Treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs, regardless of attribution, was observed in 12 patients (6.3%); the most common reason was COVID-19/COVID-19 pneumonia (1.6%).\n\n\n\nA copy of the poster can be found on the [Publications page](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AVCA26pqLbRe5sn9ikEsg34zHo816NhNjLH993OLmf9AXaDH3DrO5HZu7_Jvv8rLsVtqpL3ow1T8zBywsNQHgJeOLmLRKLEtfFuD3Dco4NU= \"Opens in a new window\") of the Checkpoint Therapeutics website.\n\nIn December 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) issued a complete response letter (“CRL”) for the cosibelimab Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for the treatment of patients with metastatic or locally advanced cSCC who are not candidates or curative surgery or radiation. The CRL only cited findings that arose during a multi-sponsor inspection of Checkpoint’s third-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) as approvability issues to address in a resubmission. In July 2024, Checkpoint announced it had completed a resubmission of the BLA to the FDA for cosibelimab to potentially address the approvability issues cited in the CRL. The resubmission was accepted by the FDA as a complete response and the FDA has set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.\n\n**About Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC)** Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer in the United States, with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 1.8 million cases according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Important risk factors for cSCC include chronic ultraviolet exposure and immunosuppressive conditions. While most cases are localized tumors amenable to curative resection, approximately 40,000 cases will become advanced, and an estimated 15,000 people will die from this disease each year. In addition to being a life-threatening disease, cSCC causes significant functional morbidities and cosmetic deformities based on tumors commonly arising in the head and neck region and invading blood vessels, nerves and vital organs such as the eye or ear. The immune-suppressed population represents a challenging target in the treatment of advanced cSCC, as they present with a more aggressive disease and with a higher risk of developing immune-related toxicities from checkpoint inhibitor treatment.\n\n**About Cosibelimab** Cosibelimab is a potential differentiated, high affinity, fully-human monoclonal antibody of IgG1 subtype that directly binds to PD-L1 and blocks the PD-L1 interaction with the programmed death receptor-1 (“PD-1”) and B7.1 receptors. Cosibelimab’s primary mechanism of action is based on the inhibition of the interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors PD-1 and B7.1, which removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on anti-tumor CD8+ T-cells to restore the cytotoxic T cell response. Cosibelimab is potentially differentiated from the currently marketed PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies through sustained high tumor target occupancy of PD-L1 to reactivate an antitumor immune response and the additional potential benefit of a functional Fc domain capable of inducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”) for potential enhanced efficacy.\n\n**About Checkpoint Therapeutics** Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers. Checkpoint is evaluating its lead antibody product candidate, cosibelimab, a potential differentiated anti-PD-L1 antibody licensed from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, as a potential new treatment for patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers, including metastatic and locally advanced cSCC.

Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include the following: the risks and uncertainties associated with the regulatory review process; uncertainties regarding the timeline of FDA review of the resubmitted BLA; any inability to successfully work with the FDA to find a satisfactory solution to address any concerns in a timely manner or at all during the review process for the BLA, including any inability to provide the FDA with data, analysis or other information sufficient to support an approval of the BLA; our, and our third party CMO’s, ability to adequately address the issues raised in the CRL; issues associated with any facility inspection or re-inspection of our third party CMO or otherwise during the review process for the BLA; the risk that our third-party CMO will not meet deadlines, and/or comply with applicable regulations; whether the FDA accepts the data and results as included in the BLA resubmission at levels consistent with the published results, or at all; our ability to execute a partnering or other relationship to enable the commercialization of cosibelimab, if approved, on acceptable terms, if at all; the risk that topline and interim data remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the topline or interim data we previously published; the risk that safety issues or trends will be observed in the clinical trial when the full safety dataset is available and analyzed; the risk that a positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints being met; risks that regulatory authorities will not accept an application for approval of cosibelimab based on data from the Phase 1 clinical trial; the risk that the clinical results from the Phase 1 clinical trial will not support regulatory approval of cosibelimab to treat cSCC or, if approved, that cosibelimab will not be commercially successful; risks related to our chemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks related to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic agreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other uncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-party suppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition; unfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the milestones we project, including the risk that the evolving and unpredictable Russia/Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic delay achievement of those milestones.

(“Checkpoint”) (Nasdaq: CKPT), a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology company, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and recent corporate updates.\n\n“With the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date set for next month, we await the decision by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on our Biologics License Application (“BLA”) resubmission for cosibelimab, our anti-programmed death ligand-1 (“PD-L1”) antibody,” said James Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint. “The $9.2 million in cash proceeds received this month from the exercise of existing warrants has strengthened our balance sheet to extend beyond our PDUFA date and into 2025. We are now fully focused on preparing for the potential approval of cosibelimab and look forward to potentially offering oncologists a new, differentiated treatment option for patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”).”\n\n**Recent Corporate Updates:**\n\n  * In July 2024, Checkpoint announced that the FDA accepted for review the resubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab as a complete response to the complete response letter (“CRL”) issued in December 2023 and set a PDUFA goal date of December 28, 2024.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined therapeutic potential of cosibelimab, its anti-PD-L1 antibody with dual mechanism of action, with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer T cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\n  * Also in July 2024, Checkpoint completed a registered direct offering priced At-the-Market under Nasdaq rules and a concurrent private placement of warrants to purchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.0 million.\n  * In September 2024, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from its pivotal trial of cosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab presented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time, with higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at the primary analyses. A copy of the ESMO poster can be found on the [Publications page](https://checkpointtx.com/publications/ \"Opens in a new window\") of Checkpoint’s website.\n  * In November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing warrants.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results:**\n\n  * **Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $4.7 million, compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $4.9 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million for the quarter and a decrease of $0.2 million, year-to-date.

We are now fully focused on preparing for the potential approval of cosibelimab and\nlook forward to potentially offering oncologists a new, differentiated treatment option for\npatients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“cSCC”).”\nRecent Corporate Updates:\nIn July 2024, Checkpoint announced that the FDA accepted for review the\nresubmission of its BLA for cosibelimab as a complete response to the complete\nresponse letter (“CRL”) issued in December 2023 and set a PDUFA goal date of\nDecember 28, 2024.\nAlso in July 2024, Checkpoint announced a collaboration to explore the combined\ntherapeutic potential of cosibelimab, its anti-PD-L1 antibody with dual mechanism of\naction, with GC Cell’s Immuncell-LC, an innovative autologous Cytokine Induced Killer\nT cell therapy composed of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer T cells.\nAlso in July 2024, Checkpoint completed a registered direct offering priced At-the-\nMarket under Nasdaq rules and a concurrent private placement of warrants to\npurchase Checkpoint common stock, for total gross proceeds of approximately $12.0\nmillion.\nIn September 2024, Checkpoint presented longer-term data from its pivotal trial of\ncosibelimab in locally advanced and metastatic cSCC during the European Society for\nMedical Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2024. Longer-term results for cosibelimab\npresented at the ESMO Congress demonstrate a deepening of response over time,\nwith higher objective response and complete response rates than initially observed at\nthe primary analyses. A copy of the ESMO poster can be found on the Publications\npage of Checkpoint’s website.\nIn November 2024, Checkpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the\nexercise of existing warrants.\nFinancial Results:\nCash Position: As of September 30, 2024, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents\ntotaled $4.7 million, compared to $5.0 million at June 30, 2024 and $4.9 million at\nDecember 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.3 million for the quarter and a decrease of $0.2\nmillion, year-to-date. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in November 2024,\nCheckpoint received $9.2 million in cash proceeds through the exercise of existing\nwarrants.\nR&D Expenses: Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $6.4 million, compared to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of\n$0.9 million. Research and development expenses for the third quarter of 2024\nincluded $0.5 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.3 million for the\nthird quarter of 2023.\nG&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024\nwere $3.4 million, compared to $2.2 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of\n$1.2 million. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 included\n$1.4 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.6 million for the third quarter\nof 2023.\nNet Loss: Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the third quarter of 2024\nwas $9.7 million, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.29\nper share, in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 included\n$1.9 million of non-cash stock expenses, compared to $0.9 million for the third quarter\nof 2023.\nAbout Checkpoint Therapeutics\nCheckpoint Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage immunotherapy and targeted oncology\ncompany focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel\ntreatments for patients with solid tumor cancers.

For those statements, we\nclaim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements include, but are not\nlimited to, statements regarding our resubmission of our BLA for cosibelimab and review\nthereof, our belief that the BLA resubmission potentially addresses all the issues in the CRL,\nour belief about the comprehensive nature of our BLA resubmission and reaching alignment\nwith the FDA on our cosibelimab BLA resubmission strategy, our ability to work with our\nthird-party contract manufacturing organization (“CMO”) and the FDA to adequately address\nthe issues raised in the CRL and execute on a pathway forward for the potential marketing\napproval of cosibelimab, the adequacy of the responses to the inspection issues submitted\nto FDA by our third-party CMO, our projections of regulatory review timelines, the\ncommercial potential of cosibelimab, if approved, and the potential differentiation of\ncosibelimab, including a potentially favorable safety profile as compared to the currently\navailable anti-programmed death receptor-1 therapies and the dual mechanism of action of\ncosibelimab translating into potential enhanced efficacy. Factors that could cause our actual\nresults to differ materially include the following: the risks and uncertainties associated with\nthe regulatory review process; uncertainties regarding the timeline of FDA review of the\nresubmitted BLA; any inability to successfully work with the FDA to find a satisfactory\nsolution to address any concerns in a timely manner or at all during the review process for\nthe BLA, including any inability to provide the FDA with data, analysis or other information\nsufficient to support an approval of the BLA; our, and our third party CMO’s, ability to\nadequately address the issues raised in the CRL; issues associated with any facility\ninspection or re-inspection of our third party CMO or otherwise during the review process for\nthe BLA; the risk that our third-party CMO will not meet deadlines, and/or comply with\napplicable regulations; whether the FDA accepts the data and results as included in the BLA\nresubmission at levels consistent with the published results, or at all; our ability to execute a\npartnering or other relationship to enable the commercialization of cosibelimab, if approved,\non acceptable terms, if at all; the risk that topline and interim data remains subject to audit\nand verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from\nthe topline or interim data we previously published; the risk that safety issues or trends will\nbe observed in the clinical trial when the full safety dataset is available and analyzed; the\nrisk that a positive primary endpoint does not translate to all, or any, secondary endpoints\nbeing met; risks that regulatory authorities will not accept an application for approval of\ncosibelimab based on data from the Phase 1 clinical trial; the risk that the clinical results\nfrom the Phase 1 clinical trial will not support regulatory approval of cosibelimab to treat\ncSCC or, if approved, that cosibelimab will not be commercially successful; risks related to\nour chemistry, manufacturing and controls and contract manufacturing relationships; risks\nrelated to our ability to obtain, perform under and maintain financing and strategic\nagreements and relationships; risks related to our need for substantial additional funds; other\nuncertainties inherent in research and development; our dependence on third-party\nsuppliers; government regulation; patent and intellectual property matters; competition;\nunfavorable market or other economic conditions; and our ability to achieve the milestones\nwe project, including the risk that the evolving and unpredictable Russia/Ukraine conflict and\nCOVID-19 pandemic delay achievement of those milestones. Further discussion about these\nand other risks and uncertainties can be found in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the\nperiod ended June 30, 2024, and in our subsequent other filings with the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission.
