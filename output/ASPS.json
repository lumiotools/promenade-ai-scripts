(“Altisource” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ASPS), a leading provider and marketplace for the real estate and mortgage industries, today reported financial results for the third quarter 2024.\n\n“We had another solid quarter, demonstrating our resilience in a challenging market. We grew Service revenue both sequentially and year-over-year despite a 15% decline in serious delinquency rates, a 7% decline in foreclosure initiations and a 14% decline in foreclosure sales through August this year compared to the same period last year(3). For the quarter, we generated $38.2 million in Service revenue, a $4.0 million or 11.8% increase over the same period last year. This growth primarily reflects sales wins and represents our strongest quarterly Service revenue performance in twelve quarters. Compared to last quarter, Service revenue grew by $1.3 million or 3.5%, primarily from ramping sales wins,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William B. Shepro.\n\nMr. Shepro further commented, “With the recent launch and on-going ramp of our Renovation business and sales wins, we are diversifying our revenue streams and customer base and positioning the Company for further growth.”\n\n**Third Quarter** **2024****Highlights****(2)**\n\nCompany, Corporate and Financial:\n\n  * Third quarter Service revenue of $38.2 million was $4.0 million, or 11.8%, higher than the same quarter of 2023\n  * Third quarter Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)(1) of $3.6 million was $2.8 million better than the same quarter of 2023 from higher Service revenue, lower Corporate costs and margin expansion in the Origination segment, partially offset by approximately $1.2 million of higher SG&A costs in the Servicer and Real Estate segment from legacy indemnity claims and bad debt expense\n  * Third quarter Adjusted EBITDA(1) margin of 9.5% was considerably stronger than the 2.6% Adjusted EBITDA(1) margin in the same quarter of 2023\n  * Third quarter Adjusted EBITDA(1) in Corporate and Others of $(7.2) million was $1.5 million better than the same quarter of 2023\n  * Third quarter gross profit margin of 31.6% was considerably stronger than the 21.1% gross profit margin in the same quarter of 2023\n  * Ended the quarter with $28.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, $15.0 million available under a revolving credit facility and $202.3 million of net debt(1)\n\n\n\nBusiness and Industry:\n\n  * Improved Adjusted EBITDA(1) in the Servicer and Real Estate and Origination segments (together “Business Segments”) to $10.8 million, or 28.3% of Service revenue, from $9.5 million, or 28.0% of Service revenue, in the same quarter of 2023\n  * Generated sales wins which we estimate represent potential annualized revenue on a stabilized basis of $1.7 million for the Servicer and Real Estate segment and $4.9 million for the Origination segment\n  * Ended the quarter with a weighted average sales pipeline between $32 million and $40 million of estimated potential revenue on a stabilized basis based upon forecasted probability of closing (comprising of between $21 million and $26 million in the Servicer and Real Estate segment and between $11 million and $14 million in the Origination segment)\n  * Industrywide foreclosure initiations were 7% lower for the eight months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (and 34% lower than the same pre-COVID-19 periods in 2019)(3)\n  * Industrywide foreclosure sales were 14% lower for the eight months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (and 54% lower than the same pre-COVID-19 periods in 2019)(3)\n  * Industrywide mortgage origination volume increased by 6% for the third quarter 2024 compared to the third quarter 2023(4)\n  * Industrywide seriously delinquent mortgage rate (90+ day past due and loans in foreclosure) declined to 1.2% in August 2024 compared to 1.3% in December 2023(3)\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter** **2024****Financial Results**\n\n  * Service revenue of $38.2 million\n  * Income from operations of $1.1 million\n  * Loss before income taxes and non-controlling interests of $(8.5) million\n  * Net loss attributable to Altisource of $(9.4) million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $3.6 million\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter** **2024****Results Compared to the****Third

We believe these measures are useful to management, existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability and cash flow generation more on the basis of continuing cost and cash flows as they exclude amortization expense related to acquisitions that occurred in prior periods and non-cash share-based compensation, as well as the effect of more significant non-operational items from earnings, cash flows from operating activities and long-term debt net of cash on-hand. We believe these measures are also useful in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. Furthermore, we believe the exclusion of more significant non-operational items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Specifically, management uses adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource to measure the on-going after tax performance of the Company because the measure adjusts for the after tax impact of more significant non-recurring items, amortization expense relating to prior acquisitions (some of which fluctuates with revenue from certain customers and some of which is amortized on a straight-line basis) and non-cash share-based compensation expense which can fluctuate based on vesting schedules, grant date timing and the value attributable to awards. We believe adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource is useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information because it provides an after-tax measure of Altisource’s on-going performance that enables these users to perform trend analysis using comparable data. Management uses adjusted diluted loss per share to further evaluate adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource while taking into account changes in the number of diluted shares over the comparable periods. We believe adjusted diluted loss per share is useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information because it also enables these users to evaluate adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource on a per share basis. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure the Company’s overall performance and Business Segments Adjusted EBITDA to measure the segments overall performance (with the adjustments discussed earlier with regard to adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource) without regard to its capitalization (debt vs. equity) or its income taxes and to perform trend analysis of the Company’s performance over time. Our effective income tax rate can vary based on the jurisdictional mix of our income. Additionally, as the Company’s capital expenditures have significantly declined over time, it provides a measure for management to evaluate the Company’s performance without regard to prior capital expenditures. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of the measures in determining bonus compensation for certain employees. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Business Segments Adjusted EBITDA are useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information for the same reasons that management finds the measure useful. Management uses net debt in evaluating the amount of debt the Company has that is in excess of cash and cash equivalents. We believe net debt is useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information for the same reasons management finds the measure useful.\n\nAltisource operates in several countries, including Luxembourg, India, the United States and Uruguay. The Company has differing effective tax rates in each country and these rates may change from year to year. In determining the tax effects related to the adjustments in calculating adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource and adjusted diluted loss per share, we use the tax rate in the country in which the adjustment applies or, if the adjustment is recognized in more than one country, we separate the adjustment by country, apply the relevant tax rate for each country to the applicable adjustment, and then sum the result to arrive at the total adjustment, net of tax. In 2019, the Company recognized a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Accordingly, for 2024 and 2023, the Company has an effective tax rate of close to 0% in Luxembourg.\n\nIt is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Altisource’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies.

(“Altisource” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ASPS), a leading provider and marketplace for the real estate and mortgage industries, today reported financial results for the second quarter 2024.\n\n“We had a strong second quarter and believe we are on track to achieve our 2024 guidance of 13% to 32% service revenue growth over 2023 and Adjusted EBITDA(1) of between $17.5 million and $22.5 million in 2024, a $21 million improvement in Adjusted EBITDA(1) over 2023 if the midpoint is achieved. For the quarter, we generated $36.9 million of Service revenue and $4.4 million of Adjusted EBITDA(1) and modestly increased cash and cash equivalents to $29.7 million. Our financial results reflect our strong sales wins, price increases, referral volume growth and lower cost base in what continues to be an incredibly difficult environment of close to historically low mortgage delinquency rates and low origination volume,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William B. Shepro.\n\nMr. Shepro further commented, “We continue to win meaningful new business and are making good progress ramping sales wins on a much lower cost base. As we ramp new business, we are cautiously optimistic that we will exit the year at a $30 million plus Adjusted EBITDA(1) run-rate.”\n\n**Second Quarter****2024 Highlights(2)**\n\nCompany, Corporate and Financial:\n\n  * Second quarter Service revenue of $36.9 million was $3.7 million, or 11%, higher than the same quarter of 2023\n  * Second quarter Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)(1) of $4.4 million was $7.9 million better than the same quarter of 2023\n  * Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA(1) margin of 11.9% was considerably stronger than the (10.5)% Adjusted EBITDA(1) margin in the same quarter of 2023 \n  * Second quarter gross profit margin of 34.0% was considerably stronger than the 16.7% gross profit margin in the same quarter of 2023\n  * Ended the quarter with $29.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $15.0 million available under a revolving credit facility and $198.7 million of net debt(1)\n\n\n\nBusiness and Industry:\n\n  * Generated sales wins which we estimate represent potential annualized revenue on a stabilized basis of $15.3 million for the Servicer and Real Estate segment and $1.5 million for the Origination segment\n  * Ended the quarter with a weighted average sales pipeline between $31 million and $39 million of estimated potential revenue on a stabilized basis based upon forecasted probability of closing (comprising of between $18 million and $23 million in the Servicer and Real Estate segment and between $13 million and $16 million in the Origination segment)\n  * Improved Adjusted EBITDA(1) in the Servicer and Real Estate and Origination segments (together “Business Segments”) to $11.6 million, or 31.3% of Service revenue, from $6.0 million, or 18.2% of Service revenue, in the same quarter of 2023\n  * Industrywide foreclosure initiations were 9% lower for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (and 37% lower than the same pre-COVID-19 periods in 2019)(3)\n  * Industrywide foreclosure sales were 14% lower for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 (and 53% lower than the same pre-COVID-19 periods in 2019)(3)\n  * Industrywide mortgage origination volume decreased by 13% for the second quarter 2024 compared to the second quarter 2023(4)\n  * Industrywide seriously delinquent mortgage rate (90+ day past due and loans in foreclosure) declined to 1.1% in June 2024 compared to 1.3% in December 2023(3)\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter****2024 Financial Results**\n\n  * Service revenue of $36.9 million\n  * Loss before income taxes and non-controlling interests of $(7.6) million\n  * Net loss attributable to Altisource of $(8.3) million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $4.4 million\n\n\n\n**Second Quarter****2024 Results Compared to the Second Quarter 2023 (unaudited):**\n\n_(in thousands, except per share data)_ | **Second Quarter 2024** | **Second Quarter 2023** | **% Change** | **Year-to-DateJune 30, 2024** | **Year-to-Date June 30, 2023** | **% Change**  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nService revenue | $ | 36,863 | $ | 33,173 | 11 | $ | 73,754 | $ | 70,244 | 5  \nRevenue | 39,121 | 35,235 | 11 | 78,590 | 74,696 | 5  \nGross profit | 12,717 | 5,532 | 130 | 25,021 | 14,036 | 78  \nIncome (loss) from operations | 2,083 | (6,809 | ) | 131 | 1,535 | (10,399 | ) | 115  \nAdjusted operating income (loss)(1) | 4,210 | (2,333 | ) | 280 | 7,168 | (59 | ) | N/M  \nLoss before income taxes and non-controlling interests | (7,566 | ) | (18,198 | ) | 58 | (16,001 | ) | (29,536 | ) | 46  \nPretax loss attributable to Altisource(1) | (7,601 | ) | (18,211 | ) | 58 | (16,077 | ) | (29,629 | ) | 46  \nAdjusted pretax loss attributable to Altisource(1) | (5,474 | ) | (13,735 | ) | 60 | (10,444 | ) | (19,289 | ) | 46  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1) | 4,384 | (3,491 | ) | 226 | 9,016 | (2,020 | ) | N/M  \nNet loss attributable to Altisource | (8,307 | ) | (18,850 | ) | 56 | (17,505 | ) | (31,797 | ) | 45  \nAdjusted net loss attributable to Altisource(1) | (5,957 | ) | (14,140 | ) | 58 | (11,555 | ) | (21,228 | ) | 46  \nDiluted loss per share | (0.29 | ) | (0.90 | ) | 68 | (0.62 | ) | (1.62 | ) | 62  \nAdjusted diluted loss per share(1) | (0.21 | ) | (0.68 | ) | 69 | (0.41 | ) | (1.08 | ) | 62  \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities | 180 | (7,882 | ) | 102 | (2,057 | ) | (10,940 | ) | 81  \nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities less additions to premises and equipment(1) | 180 | (7,882 | ) | 102 | (2,057 | ) | (10,940 | ) | 81  \nMargins:  \nGross profit / service revenue | 34 | % | 17 | % | 34 | % | 20 | %  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1) / service revenue | 12 | % | (11) | % | 12 | % | (3) | %  \nN/M — not meaningful.  \n  \n  * Second quarter and year-to-date 2023 loss before income taxes and non-controlling interests includes $0.1 million and $3.3 million. respectively, of debt amendment costs (no comparative amount for the second quarter and year-to-date 2024).

We believe these measures are useful to management, existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability and cash flow generation more on the basis of continuing cost and cash flows as they exclude amortization expense related to acquisitions that occurred in prior periods and non-cash share-based compensation, as well as the effect of more significant non-operational items from earnings, cash flows from operating activities and long-term debt net of cash on-hand. We believe these measures are also useful in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. Furthermore, we believe the exclusion of more significant non-operational items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis. Specifically, management uses adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource to measure the on-going after tax performance of the Company because the measure adjusts for the after tax impact of more significant non-recurring items, amortization expense relating to prior acquisitions (some of which fluctuates with revenue from certain customers and some of which is amortized on a straight-line basis) and non-cash share-based compensation expense which can fluctuate based on vesting schedules, grant date timing and the value attributable to awards. We believe adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource is useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information because it provides an after-tax measure of Altisource’s on-going performance that enables these users to perform trend analysis using comparable data. Management uses adjusted diluted loss per share to further evaluate adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource while taking into account changes in the number of diluted shares over the comparable periods. We believe adjusted diluted loss per share is useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information because it also enables these users to evaluate adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource on a per share basis. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure the Company’s overall performance and Business Segments Adjusted EBITDA to measure the segments overall performance (with the adjustments discussed earlier with regard to adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource) without regard to its capitalization (debt vs. equity) or its income taxes and to perform trend analysis of the Company’s performance over time. Our effective income tax rate can vary based on the jurisdictional mix of our income. Additionally, as the Company’s capital expenditures have significantly declined over time, it provides a measure for management to evaluate the Company’s performance without regard to prior capital expenditures. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as one of the measures in determining bonus compensation for certain employees. We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Business Segments Adjusted EBITDA are useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information for the same reasons that management finds the measure useful. Management uses net debt in evaluating the amount of debt the Company has that is in excess of cash and cash equivalents. We believe net debt is useful to existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information for the same reasons management finds the measure useful.\n\nAltisource operates in several countries, including Luxembourg, India, the United States and Uruguay. The Company has differing effective tax rates in each country and these rates may change from year to year. In determining the tax effects related to the adjustments in calculating adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource and adjusted diluted loss per share, we use the tax rate in the country in which the adjustment applies or, if the adjustment is recognized in more than one country, we separate the adjustment by country, apply the relevant tax rate for each country to the applicable adjustment, and then sum the result to arrive at the total adjustment, net of tax. In 2019, the Company recognized a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Accordingly, for 2024 and 2023, the Company has an effective tax rate of close to 0% in Luxembourg.\n\nIt is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Altisource’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. The non-GAAP financial information should not be unduly relied upon.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is calculated by removing intangible asset amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, cost of cost savings initiatives and other, debt amendment costs and unrealized loss on warrant liability from income (loss) from operations. Pretax loss attributable to Altisource is calculated by removing non-controlling interests from loss before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Adjusted pretax loss attributable to Altisource is calculated by removing non-controlling interests, intangible asset amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, cost of cost savings initiatives and other, debt amendment costs and unrealized loss on warrant liability from loss before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Adjusted net loss attributable to Altisource is calculated by removing intangible asset amortization expense (net of tax), share-based compensation expense (net of tax), cost of cost savings initiatives and other (net of tax), debt amendment costs, unrealized loss on warrant liability and certain income tax related items from net loss attributable to Altisource. Adjusted diluted loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to Altisource after removing intangible asset amortization expense (net of tax), share-based compensation expense (net of tax), cost of cost savings initiatives and other (net of tax), debt amendment costs (net of tax), unrealized loss on warrant liability (net of tax) and certain income tax related items by the weighted average number of diluted shares. Net cash used in operating activities less additions to premises and equipment is calculated by removing additions to premises and equipment from net cash used in operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by removing the income tax provision, interest expense (net of interest income), depreciation and amortization, intangible asset amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, cost of cost savings initiatives and other, debt amendment costs and unrealized loss on warrant liability from net loss attributable to Altisource. Business Segments Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by removing non-controlling interests, depreciation and amortization, intangible asset amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, cost of cost savings initiatives and other from income before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Net debt is calculated as long-term debt, including current portion, minus cash and cash equivalents.\n\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are as
