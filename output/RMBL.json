(NASDAQ: RMBL) (the \"Company\" or \"RumbleOn\") announced today that it has commenced a $10.0 million fully backstopped registered equity rights offering (the \"Rights Offering\"), pursuant to which the Company is expected to receive aggregate gross proceeds of $10.0 million, less expenses related to the Rights Offering. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Rights Offering for general corporate purposes which may include repayment of the Company's convertible senior 6.75% promissory notes due January 1, 2025. The proceeds raised will also satisfy, in part, the additional capital financing obligations of the Company pursuant to a recent amendment to the Company's credit agreement with Oaktree. [ ![RumbleOnLogo](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568035/RumbleOn_Logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2568035/RumbleOn_Logo.html) The Company is distributing at no charge to the holders of (i) its Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Class A common stock\"), and (ii) Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Class B common stock\" and, together with the Class A common stock, the \"common stock\"), in each case as of the close of business on November 25, 2024 (the \"Record Date\"), non-transferable subscription rights (the \"Subscription Rights\") to purchase up to 2,392,344 shares of Class B common stock at price of $4.18 per share (the \"Subscription Price\"). The aggregate subscription value of all shares of Class B common stock available for purchase in the Rights Offering is $10.0 million. Each holder of common stock as of the Record Date (each, an \"Eligible Stockholder\") will receive one Subscription Right for each share of the common stock owned as of the Record Date. Each Subscription Right entitles the holder to purchase 0.0677 shares of Class B common stock. The Company will not issue any fractional shares of Class B common stock in the Rights Offering. Instead, the Company will round down the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock the Eligible Stockholders are entitled to receive to the nearest whole number. Accordingly, as each Subscription Right represents the right to purchase 0.0677 shares of Class B common stock, an Eligible Stockholder must hold at least 15 shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock to receive sufficient Subscription Rights to purchase at least one share of Class B common stock in the Rights Offering. Eligible Stockholders will not be entitled to exercise an over-subscription privilege to purchase additional shares of Class B common stock that may remain unsubscribed as a result of any unexercised Subscription Rights. The Subscription Rights will expire and will have no value if they are not exercised prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on the expiration time for the Rights Offering (the \"Expiration Time\"), which is currently expected to be 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on December 12, 2024, unless the Company, in its sole discretion, extends the period for exercising the Subscription Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Support and Standby Purchase Agreement (defined below), the Company reserves the right to cancel, terminate, amend, or extend the Rights Offering at any time prior to the Expiration Time. On November 26, 2024, the Company entered into a support and standby purchase agreement (the \"Support and Standby Purchase Agreement\") with Stone House Capital Management, LLC, which is a holder of Class B common stock and is managed by Mark Cohen, a member of the board of directors of the Company (together with its affiliates, the \"Standby Purchaser\"), and Mark Tkach and William Coulter, each of whom is a holder of the Class B common stock and a member of the board of directors of the Company (collectively, the \"Support Purchasers\" and, together with the Standby Purchaser, the \"Investors\"). The Support and Standby Purchase Agreement provides, among other things, that (i) the Standby Purchaser will purchase from the Company in a private placement any shares of Class B common stock included in the Rights Offering that are not subscribed for and purchased by Eligible Stockholders (collectively, the \"Backstop Securities\") for the same per share Subscription Price payable by the Eligible Stockholders electing to exercise their Subscription Rights in the Rights Offering; and (ii) each Support Purchaser will exercise all of his respective Subscription Rights in full prior to the Expiration Time. **Other Important Information** The Subscription Rights will not be listed for trading on any stock exchange or market. Therefore, there will be no public market for the Subscription Rights. However, the shares of Class B common stock issued upon the exercise of the Subscription Rights will remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the symbol \"RMBL.\" The Company expects that Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, LLC, the subscription and information agent for the Rights Offering, will distribute subscription documents for the Rights Offering to Eligible Stockholders beginning on or about November 26, 2024. Holders of shares of common stock held in \"street name\" through a brokerage account, bank or other nominee should contact their broker, bank or other nominee for details regarding participation in the Rights Offering. For any questions or further information about the Rights Offering, please contact the information agent, at (888) 789-8409 (Toll-Free), or via email at shareholder@broadridge.com. Neither the Company nor its board of directors has made or will make any recommendation to holders regarding participation in the Rights Offering. Holders should make an independent investment decision about whether to participate in the Rights Offering based on their own assessment of the Company's business and the Rights Offering. The offering of the Class B common stock pursuant to the Rights Offering is being made pursuant to the Company's existing effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Reg. No. 333-281862) on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") and a prospectus supplement (and the accompanying base prospectus) filed with the SEC on the date hereof.

(NASDAQ: RMBL), the \"Company\" or \"RumbleOn\", today announced results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024. [ ![RumbleOn, Inc. \\(NASDAQ: RMBL\\), operates through two operating segments: our Powersports dealership group and Wholesale Express, LLC, an asset-light transportation services provider focused on the automotive industry. The Company's Powersports group is the largest powersports retail group in the United States \\(as measured by reported revenue, major unit sales and dealership locations\\), offering over 500 powersports franchises representing 50 different brands of products.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2554959/RumbleOnLogo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2554959/RumbleOnLogo.html) **Key Third Quarter 2024 Highlights (Compared to Third Quarter 2023):**\n\n  * Revenue of $295.0 million decreased 12.7%\n  * Net loss totaled $11.2 million compared to net loss of $16.5 million\n  * Selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) was $65.9 million compared to $85.0 million\n  * Adjusted EBITDA(1) of $6.8 million decreased 26.1%\n\n**Other Highlights:**\n\n  * Received commitments for $30.0 million of incremental capital from our three largest shareholders, of which $10 million is in the form of a backstopped common equity rights offering\n  * Executed term loan credit agreement amendment giving the business more flexibility to operate\n  * Engaged an investment bank to explore a refinancing of the Company's debt\n  * Reduced inventories by $53.9 million and floor plan notes payable by $52.9 million during the quarter\n  * Operating cash inflows for the first nine months totaled $68.6 million compared to cash outflows of $18.5 million in 2023\n  * Reduced Non-Vehicle Net Debt by $25.9 million in the first nine months of 2024\n  * Acquired a Harley-Davidson dealership in Massachusetts in August 2024\n\n\"During the third quarter, our team navigated an incrementally more challenging environment and delivered strong performance on key areas of the business. Our goal communicated earlier this year to reduce new inventories by the end of 2024 is largely on track. Operating cash flows continue to significantly outperform compared to last year. Our SG&A as a percent of gross profit dollars has decreased, which evidences the increasing productivity of our operations, and we expect to drive continuous improvements in further cost optimization. I am incredibly proud of the team and their resilience in this tough environment. In addition, we have received significant support from our three largest shareholders, which aligns with our goal to deleverage our balance sheet and lower our cost of capital. We believe all of this is laying the groundwork for an improved 2025,\" stated Mike Kennedy, RumbleOn's CEO. **Third Quarter****2024 Results** | **Third Quarter**  \n---  \n_($ in millions)_ | **2024** | **2023** | **YOY Change**  \nRevenue | $ 295.0 | $ 338.1 | (12.7) %  \nGross Profit | $ 74.3 | $ 92.0 | (19.2) %  \nSG&A | $ 65.9 | $ 85.0 | (22.5) %  \nAdjusted SG&A(1) | $ 64.3 | $ 82.1 | (21.7) %  \nOperating Income (Loss) | $ 5.3 | $ (0.2) | NM  \nNet Loss | $ (11.2) | $ (16.5) | 32.1 %  \nAdjusted EBITDA(1) | $ 6.8 | $ 9.2 | (26.1) %  \n**_Unit Retail Sales:_**  \nNew Powersports | 9,740 | 10,851 | (10.2) %  \nPre-owned Powersports | 4,549 | 5,619 | (19.0) %  \n  \n**Nine Months Ended September 30,**  \n---  \n_($ in millions)_ | **2024** | **2023** | **YOY Change**  \nOperating Cash Flow | $ 68.6 | $ (18.5) | 470.8 %  \nCapital Expenditures | $ (1.6) | $ (7.8) | 79.5 %  \nFree Cash Flow(1) | $ 67.0 | $ (26.3) | 354.8 %  \n**Sep. 30,** | **Dec. 31,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Change**  \nCash (unrestricted) | $ 50.1 | $ 58.9 | (14.9) %  \nLong-term Debt, including Current Maturities | $ 249.0 | $ 274.3 | (9.2) %  \nNon-Vehicle Debt | $ 267.1 | $ 301.8 | (11.5) %  \nNon-Vehicle Net Debt(1) | $ 217.0 | $ 242.9 | (10.7) %  \n  \n_(1)_ | _Adjusted SG &A, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Non-Vehicle Net Debt are non-GAAP measures.

Adjusted EBITDA further adds back non-cash stock-based compensation costs, transaction costs, certain litigation expenses not associated with our ongoing operations, charges related to the 2023 proxy contest and reorganization of our Board of Directors, and other non-recurring costs and credits, as these recoveries, charges and expenses are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not necessarily an indicator of ongoing, future company performance. Adjusted EBITDA is reduced by floor plan interest expense. Our industry typically treats Interest expense on vehicle floor plan debt as operating expense, as vehicle floor plan debt is integral to our operations and is collateralized by our powersports vehicles. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA is one of the primary metrics we use to evaluate the financial performance of our business. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is helpful in highlighting trends in our operating results and it is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry.\n\nA reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is provided below:\n\n**Third Quarter** | **First Nine Months**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**Net loss (GAAP)** | **$ (11.2)** | **$ (16.5)** | **$ (22.2)** | **$ (47.0)**  \nLoss from discontinued operations | - | - | - | (1.0)  \nLoss from continuing operations | (11.2) | (16.5) | (22.2) | (46.0)  \n**Add back:**  \nFloor plan interest expense | 4.4 | 3.9 | 12.7 | 9.8  \nOther interest expense  | 12.2 | 16.0 | 36.2 | 46.0  \nDepreciation and amortization | 3.1 | 7.2 | 9.7 | 17.2  \nIncome tax benefit | - | (3.5) | (0.4) | (9.7)  \n**EBITDA (non-GAAP)** | **8.5** | **7.1** | **36.0** | **17.3**  \n**Adjustments:**  \nFloor plan interest expense | (4.4) | (3.9) | (12.7) | (9.8)  \nStock-based compensation | 1.1 | 3.1 | 3.9 | 10.9  \nLease expense associated with favorable related party leases in excess of contractual lease payments | 0.3 | 0.2 | 0.8 | 0.8  \nOther non-recurring costs(1) | 1.3 | 1.1 | 2.6 | 2.1  \nPersonnel restructuring costs(2) | - | 0.6 | 0.1 | 5.3  \nProxy contest and Board reorganization charges | - | 0.4 | - | 5.1  \nLoss associated with ROF loan receivables(3) | - | 0.6 | - | 6.0  \n**Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)** | **$ 6.8** | **$ 9.2** | **$ 30.7** | **$ 37.7**  \n  \n_(1)_ | _Other non-recurring costs, which include one-time expenses incurred. For 2024 period, this was primarily costs for litigation not part of normal, ongoing operations and a canceled service contract.

We view free cash flow when assessing the Company's sources of liquidity and capital resources. We believe that free cash flow is helpful in understanding the Company's capital requirements and provides an additional means to reflect the cash flow trends in the Company's business. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the cash that our operating businesses generate, before taking into account non-operational cash movements. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, we think it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nA reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to Free Cash Flow is provided below:\n\n**Nine Months Ended Sep. 30,**  \n---  \n**2024** | **2023**  \n**Cash flows from operating activities (GAAP)** | **$ 68.6** | **$ (18.5)**  \nLess:  \nCapital expenditures | (1.6) | (7.8)  \n**Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP)** | **$ 67.0** | **$ (26.3)**  \n  \n**Non-Vehicle Net Debt**\n\nWe define Non-Vehicle Net Debt as total principal of long-term debt, including current maturities, less unrestricted cash. Our restricted cash is principally related to vehicle floor plan debt and is therefore not part of this calculation. Vehicle floor plan debt and finance lease obligations are not included in this measure. We believe that Non-Vehicle Net Debt is useful to investors and analysts as a measure of our financial position. We use Non-Vehicle Net Debt to monitor and compare our financial position from period to period. \n\nA reconciliation of total long-term debt, including current maturities to Non-Vehicle Net Debt is provided below:\n\n**As of** **Sep. 30, 2024** | **As of** **Dec. 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Long-term debt, including current maturities (GAAP)** | **$ 249.0** | **$ 274.3**  \nAdd back: unamortized debt discount and issuance costs | 18.1 | 27.5  \nPrincipal of long-term debt, including current maturities | 267.1 | 301.8  \nLess: unrestricted cash | (50.1) | (58.9)  \n**Non-Vehicle Net Debt (non-GAAP)** | **$ 217.0** | **$ 242.9**  \n  \n**RumbleOn, Inc.****Non-GAAP Measures**(Unaudited)($ in millions)\n\n**Adjusted SG &A**\n\nWe define Adjusted SG&A as SG&A adjusted to deduct transaction costs, certain litigation expenses not associated with our ongoing operations, charges related to the 2023 proxy contest and reorganization of our Board of Directors, and other non-recurring costs, as these charges and expenses are not considered a part of our core business operations and are not necessarily an indicator of the ongoing run rate of our SG&A. We use Adjusted SG&A to measure our progress toward achieving our Vision 2026 goals. Adjusted SG&A is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be used as a replacement for SG&A reported in compliance with GAAP. Adjusted SG&A has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total SG&A for the period.

Cacicio expressed his enthusiasm for the role, “I am honored to take the helm at Revolution Road Harley-Davidson. Our team is committed to serving the dealership’s loyal customers and adding exciting new initiatives that support the Harley-Davidson brand.” The dealership, previously known as Monty’s Harley-Davidson, had been owned by Kathleen Monaghan, a long-time member of the area’s powersports community. [Revolution Road Harley-Davidson](https://www.revolutionroadharley.com/) will become a premier destination for Harley-Davidson enthusiasts in New England. Located mid-way between Boston and Providence RI, the location provides easy access for numerous current and future Harley owners. This purchase marks RumbleOn’s 56th dealership, a significant milestone as the first acquisition under CEO Mike Kennedy. Kennedy commented on the strategic importance of acquisitions, saying, “Dealership acquisitions are a crucial element in achieving RumbleOn’s Vision 2026 strategic plan. Revolution Road Harley-Davidson is a perfect addition to our growing portfolio of dealerships.” [ ![Revolution-Road-HD-RGB](https://www.cyclenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Revolution-Road-HD-RGB-1024x1024.jpg) ](https://www.cyclenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Revolution-Road-HD-RGB.jpg) Along with this acquisition, RumbleOn has recently expanded its presence with two additional dealership locations. Earlier this summer, RumbleOn opened [Indian Motorcycle of Cincinnati](https://www.indiancincinnati.com/), a market which had not been served by an Indian dealership. “Our close partnerships with all of our OEM’s, in this case Polaris, made Indian Motorcycle of Cincinnati a reality,” continued Kennedy. RumbleOn also recently opened [](https://www.ridenowhoustontx.com/)[](https://www.ridenowhoustontx.com/)[RideNow Powersports](https://www.ridenowhoustontx.com/) Houston, a dealership pilot project focused on selling pre-owned vehicles exclusively. This innovative dealership offers a range of pre-owned powersports products, with an emphasis on custom and touring motorcycles. The location near Interstate 45 north of Houston also carries a comprehensive selection of accessories and riding gear. “Our strategic plan calls for us to carefully manage our capital and to run the best performing dealerships in the country,” said Kennedy. “The three new dealerships we opened this summer, each one quite different, are great examples of how we will grow and achieve our Vision 2026 goals and continue to focus our capital allocation on generating long-term per-share value for our shareholders.”  \n  \n## Contact Us\n\n**Corporate Operations**\n\n901 W Walnut Hill Ln #110AIrving, TX 75038\n\n**Investor Contact**\n\ninvestors@rumbleon.com\n\n##  Email Alerts\n\n[![RumbleOn](https://d36cz9elvz3vfp.cloudfront.net/2473/rumble-on-logo-white-205x66.png)](https://www.rumbleon.com/)\n\n  * [Buy](https://www.rumbleon.com/Buy/Index)\n  * [Finance](https://www.rumbleon.com/Finance)\n  * [Cash Offer](https://www.rumbleon.com/sell/vehicles/step1)\n  * [List](https://www.rumbleon.com/list-your-vehicle/step-1)\n  * [Find a Dealer](https://www.rumbleon.com/dealerships)\n\n\n\n  * [Careers](https://go.rumbleon.com/careers-at-rumbleon)\n  * [Contact Us](https://www.rumbleon.com/contact-us)\n  * [Investor Relations](https://investors.rumbleon.com/)\n  * [Press Releases](https://investors.rumbleon.com/press-releases)\n  * [About Us](https://www.rumbleon.com/about-us)\n\n\n\n[ ![Google Play](https://d36cz9elvz3vfp.cloudfront.net/2473/google_play_badge@2x.png) ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halcyontek.rumbleon.login) [ ![App Store](https://d36cz9elvz3vfp.cloudfront.net/2473/App_Store_Badge@2x.png) ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rumbleon/id1219198993?ls=1&mt=8)\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/rumbleon.official) [](https://twitter.com/rumbleon_) [](https://www.instagram.com/rumbleon.official/) [](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUm6-vHwq6ppsWo5Aj_99tA) [](https://www.pinterest.com/ready2rumbleon/)\n\ninvestors@rumbleon.com\n\n©2024 RumbleOn, All rights reserved. \n\n  * [Privacy](https://www.rumbleon.com/privacy)\n  * [Terms](https://www.rumbleon.com/termsofuse)\n\n\n\n[Privacy](https://investors.rumbleon.com/Profiles/main/Disclaimer1.asp?BzID=2473)  \n---  \n  \n[![Resize Viewer - Reduce](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/ButtonMinimize.jpg)](javascript:ResetSize\\(\\);) [![Resize Viewer - Expand](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/ButtonMaximize.jpg)](javascript:ResizeViewer\\(\\);) [![Close window](https://www.b2i.us/profiles/images/ButtonRedClose.jpg)](Javascript:document.body.className=''; b2iCloseDownloadPage\\(\\);)  \n---\n"
