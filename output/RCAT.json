Any statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “believes,” “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continues,” “intends,” “plans” and “would” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. For example, statements concerning financial condition, possible or assumed future results of operations, growth opportunities, and plans are all forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding:\n\n | the market and sales success of our existing and any new products;  \n---|---  \n | our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms;  \n---|---  \n | our ability to make acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses into our company;   \n---|---  \n | our ability to attract and retain management;   \n---|---  \n | the intensity of competition;  \n---|---  \n | changes in the political and regulatory environment and in business and economic conditions in the United States and globally; and  \n---|---  \n | geopolitical conflicts throughout the world, including those in Ukraine and Israel.   \n---|---  \n  \nAll of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only.

Since April 2016, the Company’s primary business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which it presently does through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Beginning in January 2020, the Company expanded the scope of its drone products and services through four acquisitions, including: \n\nA. | In January 2020, the Company acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (“FPV”) drones and equipment, primarily to consumers. The purchase price was $1,995,114.  \n---|---  \nB. | In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings, Ltd. (“Fat Shark”), a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was $8,354,076.  \n---|---  \nC. | In May 2021, the Company acquired Skypersonic which provided hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is either denied or not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.  \n---|---  \nD. | In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal Drones, Inc. (“Teal”), a leader in commercial and government Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (“UAV”) technology. The purchase price was $10,011,279.  \n---|---  \n  \nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment (“Enterprise”) and the Consumer segment (“Consumer”) to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\n\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects the Company's decision to focus its efforts and capital on defense where it believes that there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value. See Note 3 and Note 7.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, the Company completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering with ThinkEquity of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated gross proceeds of $9,200,000 and net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Presentation** – The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation with respect to the interim financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three months ended July 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending April 30, 2025. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2024, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n**Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements **– The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Stockholders’ Equity for the three months ended July 31, 2023, which were originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 19, 2023, have been restated. The Company revised its financial statements to remove derivative liabilities due to erroneously reporting warrants from our convertible note financings, as described in Note 14, as having a derivative component.\n\n7   \n---  \n  \nThe impacts of these restatements are detailed in the tables below:\n\n**Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations** **For the three months ended July 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**Originally** **Reported** |  **As** **Restated** | Change  \nChange in fair value of derivative liability | $ | (26,520 | ) | $ | — | $ | (26,520 | )  \nNet loss | $ | (5,810,348 | ) | $ | (5,836,868 | ) | $ | (26,520 | )  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity** **For the three months ended July 31, 2023**  \n---  \n**Originally** **Reported** |  **As** **Restated** | Change  \nAdditional paid-in capital | $ | 110,905,033 | $ | 113,554,659 | $ | 2,649,626  \nAccumulated deficit | $ | (60,397,141 | ) | $ | (62,914,971 | ) | $ | (2,517,830 | )  \nTotal equity | $ | 49,993,398 | $ | 50,125,194 | $ | 131,796  \n  \n**Principles of Consolidation** – Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries which include Teal and Skypersonic as well as Rotor Riot and Fat Shark through the sale date of February 16, 2024. Non-majority owned investments, including the formerly wholly owned subsidiaries Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, are accounted for using the equity method when the Company is able to significantly influence the operating policies of the investee. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe Consumer segment businesses are characterized as discontinued operations in these financial statements. The operating results and cash flows of discontinued operations are separately stated in those respective financial statements. See Note 3. \n\n**Use of Estimates** – The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets, including goodwill, for impairment, and (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity method investments.\n\n**Concentration of Credit Risk **– Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, include trade receivables. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, generally does not require collateral and considers the credit risk profile of the customer from which the receivable is due in further evaluating collection risk. Customers that accounted for 10% or greater of accounts receivable, net as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\n**July 31, 2024** | **April 30, 2024**  \n---|---  \nCustomer A | 38 | % | 53 | %  \nCustomer B | 25 | % | 24 | %  \n  \nAs of July 31, 2024, three customers accounted for equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue, totaling 32%, 20% and 12%, respectively. As of July 31, 2023, three customers accounted for equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue, totaling 13%, 12% and 10%, respectively.\n\n8   \n---  \n  \n**Equity Method Investment – **The equity method of accounting is applied to investments in which the Company has an ownership interest of between 20% and 50%. The Company evaluates its equity method investments each reporting period for evidence of a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company performed this analysis and concluded that its investment in UMAC was other-than-temporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge of $11,353,875 for the year ended April 30, 2024. See Note 7 for additional information.\n\n**Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities, and Related Disclosures** – The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nThe guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\n_Level 1_ : Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n\n_Level 2_ : Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and \n\n_Level 3_ : Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data. \n\nThe Company's financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of these instruments approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.\n\n**Revenue Recognition **– The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). This standard includes a comprehensive evaluation of factors to be considered regarding revenue recognition including (i) identifying the promised goods, (ii) evaluating performance obligations, (iii) measuring the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations if there are multiple components, and (v) recognizing revenue as each obligation is satisfied. The Company’s revenue transactions include the shipment of goods to customers as orders are fulfilled, completion of non-recurring engineering, completion of training, and customer support services. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product or prototypes unless otherwise specified in the purchase order or contract. Customer deposits totaled $50,039 and $53,939 at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. From time to time, non-recurring engineering contracts may involve the capitalization of engineering prototypes, classified as contract assets. Contract assets totaled $0 and $1,477,859 at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively.\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by revenue type:\n\nThree Months Ended July 31,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nContract related | $ | 886,440 | $ | 310,881  \nProduct related | 1,890,095 | 1,437,248  \nTotal | $ | 2,776,535 | $ | 1,748,129  \n  \n9   \n---  \n  \n**Product Warranty - **The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based upon both current and historical product sales data and warranty costs incurred. Product warranty reserves are recorded in current liabilities under accrued expenses. Warranty liability was approximately $541,000 and $372,000 as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 respectively.\n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements **– Management does not believe that recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Comprehensive Loss **– Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholders' equity but are excluded from net loss. Our other comprehensive loss is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities. During the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, comprehensive loss was $4,621 higher and $291,035 lower than net loss, respectively, related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities totaling $0 and $289,389, respectively, and foreign currency translation adjustments of $4,621  and $1,646.\n\n**Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share** – Basic and diluted net loss per share has been calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock because they were anti-dilutive. The conversion or exercise of these common stock equivalents would dilute earnings per share if we become profitable in the future. Outstanding securities not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive include:\n\nJuly 31, 2024 | July 31, 2023  \n---|---  \nSeries B Preferred Stock, as converted | 3,896 | 3,896  \nStock options | 7,319,988 | 6,884,017  \nWarrants | 1,821,291 | 1,539,999  \nRestricted stock | 2,202,599 | 842,701  \nTotal | 11,347,774 | 9,270,613  \n  \n**Related Parties** – Parties are considered to be related to us if they have control or significant influence, directly or indirectly, over us, including key management personnel and members of the Board of Directors or are direct relatives of key management personnel of members of the Board of Directors. Related Party transactions are disclosed in Note 16.\n\n**Liquidity and Going Concern **– The Company has never been profitable and has incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue its long-term growth strategy. During the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $12,000,000  and used cash in operating activities of approximately $2,300,000. As of July 31, 2024, working capital totaled approximately $17,200,000. These financial results and our financial position at July 31, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. However, the Company has recently taken actions to strengthen its liquidity. On December 11, 2023, we completed a public offering of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000 as further described in Note 1 and Note 12. In addition, the Company’s operating plan for the next twelve months has been updated to reflect recent operating improvements. Revenues have accelerated and are expected to continue growing. The Company’s manufacturing facility is scaling production and gross profits are projected to increase. If necessary, the Company will seek to obtain additional debt financing for which there can be no guarantee. As described in Note 7, the Company sold its equity method investment for $4,400,000 in July 2024. As described in Note 18, the Company closed a financing with proceeds of $8 million to be received in late September 2024. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue its operations, and meet its financial obligations, for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n\n**Note 3 – Divestiture of Consumer Segment**\n\nOn February 16, 2024,the Company closed the sale of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark to Unusual Machines. The sale was conducted pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated November 21, 2022, as amended on April 13, 2023, July 10, 2023, and December 11, 2023 (the “SPA”). The transaction closed concurrently with UMAC’s initial public offering and listing on the NYSE American exchange (“IPO”) under the symbol “UMAC.” \n\nThe total consideration received by the Company was valued at $20 million and consisted of i) $1 million in cash, ii) $2 million in a secured promissory note (“Promissory Note”), iii) $17 million in securities of Unusual Machines, and iv) a post-closing adjustment for excess working capital.\n\n10   \n---  \n  \n_Secured Promissory Note_\n\nThe Promissory Note from Unusual Machines bears interest at a rate of 8% per year, is due 18 months from the date of issue, and requires monthly payments of interest due in arrears on the 15th day of each month. In the event of a Qualified Financing (defined as one or more related debt or equity financings by UMAC resulting in net proceeds of at least $5 million, other than UMAC’s completed IPO), the Company may require payment of this Promissory Note in whole or in part upon written notice given within 10 days of the Qualified Financing. During the occurrence and continuance of any event of default under the Note, the Company may, at its option, convert the amounts due under the Note to common stock of UMAC in whole or in part from time to time. The conversion price will be a 10% discount to the average daily volume weighted average price for UMAC’s common stock over the 10 days preceding the conversion price. Conversions under the Note will be limited such that no conversion may be made to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion, the Company, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of UMAC’s common stock. This limit may be increased by the Company upon 61 days written notice.\n\n_Unusual Machines Securities_\n\nThe $17 million worth of UMAC common stock was valued at the IPO price for UMAC’s common stock of $4.00 per share, resulting in 4,250,000 shares of UMAC common stock being issued to the Company (representing approximately 49% of UMAC’s issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to the IPO and to the issuance of common stock to the Company upon closing of the IPO).\n\n_Working Capital_\n\nThe purchase price was adjusted for working capital as of the closing date. Actual working capital excess amounts increased the principal amount of the Promissory Note dollar for dollar. Working capital as of closing was finalized at $2 million in July 2024. As a result, UMAC issued the Company $4,000,000 of its 8% Promissory Notes due November 30, 2025 (the “New Notes”) reflecting (i) satisfaction and settlement of working capital adjustments and (ii) a maturity date extension to November 30, 2025.\n\nThe Consumer segment has been classified as Discontinued Operations and reported in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\n_You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below.

All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted._\n\n**Overview**\n\nWe are a technology company focused on developing products, services, and solutions to the drone industry. We were originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado in 1984 under the name “Oravest International, Inc.” In November 2016, we changed our name to “TimefireVR, Inc.” and re-incorporated in Nevada. In May 2019, we completed a share exchange agreement with Propware which resulted in the Propware shareholders acquiring an 83% ownership interest, and management control, of the Company. In connection with the share exchange agreement, we changed our name to “Red Cat Holdings, Inc.”, and our operating focus to the drone industry.\n\nPrior to the share exchange agreement, Propware was focused on the research and development of software solutions that could provide secure cloud-based analytics, storage and services for the drone industry. Following the share exchange agreement and name change, we have completed a series of acquisitions and financings which have broadened the scope of our activities in the drone industry.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nOn September 4, 2024, the Company, Teal, FW Acquisition, Inc. (“Buyer”), and FlightWave Aerospace Systems Corporation (“Seller”) entered into and closed on the transactions set forth in an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA” and the transactions set forth therein, the “Transactions”), pursuant to which Buyer purchased and Seller sold certain assets used in designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling long range, AI-powered UAVs for commercial use.\n\nAs a condition to the closing of the Transactions, each of the shareholders of the Seller entered into a Joinder Agreement with the Company, Teal and Buyer pursuant to which such shareholder agreed to the terms of the APA and agreed to be bound by the provisions thereof applicable to the Seller’s shareholders, including without limit, the indemnification provisions in the APA.\n\nThe purchase price under the APA is equal to $14 million worth of shares of the Company’s common stock which are payable as follows: \n\n | $7 million worth of the Company’s common stock to be issued on September 30, 2024, at a price per share equal to the VWAP on such date, which shall be payable to the preferred shareholders of the Seller as set forth in the APA.  \n---|---  \n | $7 million worth of the Company’s common stock to be issued on December 31, 2024, at a price per share equal to the VWAP on such date, of which (i) $2 million will be payable to preferred shareholders of the Seller, and (ii) $5 million will be payable to common shareholders and option-holders of the Seller as set forth the APA.  \n---|---  \n  \nOn September 23, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Lind Global Asset Management X LLC (“Lind”). Under the SPA, within days of closing, we will receive $8 million in funding from Lind in exchange for our issuance to Lind of a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of $9,600,000 (the “Note”) and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant for the purchase of 750,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.50 per share, exercisable for 5 years (the “Warrant”). As addition consideration to Lind, we have agreed to pay a commitment fee in the amount of $280,000, which may be paid by deduction from the funding to be received. The Note, which does not accrue interest, shall be repaid in eighteen (18) consecutive monthly installments in the amount of $533,334 beginning six months from the issuance date. \n\n20   \n---  \n  \n**Plan of Operations**\n\nSince April 2016, our primary business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which we presently do through our three wholly owned subsidiaries Skypersonic, Teal, and Propware. Beginning in January 2020, we expanded the scope of our drone products and services through four acquisitions, including:\n\nA. | In January 2020, we acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (FPV) drones and equipment, primarily to the consumer marketplace. The purchase price was $1,995,114.  \n---|---  \nB. | In November 2020, we acquired Fat Shark Holdings, a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was $8,354,076.  \n---|---  \nC. | In May 2021, we acquired Skypersonic which provides hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.  \n---|---  \nD. | In August 2021, we acquired Teal, a leader in commercial and government UAV technology, primarily drones, to government and commercial enterprises, most notably, the military. Teal manufactures drones approved by the U.S. Department of Defense for reconnaissance, public safety, and inspection applications. The purchase price was $10,011,279.  \n---|---  \n  \nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment (“Enterprise”) and the Consumer segment (“Consumer”) to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\n\nThe Enterprise segment’s current business strategy is focused on providing integrated robotic hardware and software for use across a variety of applications. Its solutions provide critical situational awareness and actionable intelligence to on-the-ground warfighters and battlefield commanders as well as firefighters and public safety officials. Our Enterprise segment’s efforts are centered on developing and scaling an American made family of systems. We have since completed construction of a manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City, Utah and believe that an increased focus by the United States government and American businesses on purchasing products that are “Made in America” provide our Enterprise segment with a competitive advantage.\n\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects our decision to focus our efforts and capital on defense where we believe there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, we entered into and closed on the transactions set forth in an Asset Purchase Agreement with FlightWave pursuant to which we purchased certain assets for designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling long range, AI-powered UAVs for commercial use. Please refer to the Recent Developments section above for further information regarding the APA and related transactions.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe analysis of our results of operations for the three months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023 includes only our Enterprise segment as our Consumer segment was divested in February 2024.\n\n**Discussion and Analysis of Three Months Ended July 31, 2024 compared to Three Months Ended July 31, 2023**\n\nRevenues\n\nConsolidated revenues totaled $2,776,535 during the three months ended July 31, 2024 (or the “2024 period”) compared to $1,748,129 during the three months ended July 31, 2023 (or the “2023 period”) representing an increase of $1,028,406, or 59%. The increase related to higher product revenue and higher contract revenue. Product revenue totaled $1,890,095 during the quarter ended July 31, 2024 compared to $1,437,248 during the quarter ended July 31, 2023 representing an increase of $452,847, or 32%. Contract revenues totaled $886,440 during the 2024 period compared to $310,881 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $575,559, or 185%. Contract revenues are primarily sourced through government agencies and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of award deliverables and amendments.\n\n21   \n---  \n  \nGross Profit\n\nConsolidated gross loss totaled $483,391 during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of $174,665 during the 2023 period representing a decrease of $658,056, or 377%. On a percentage basis, gross loss was 17% during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of 10% during the 2023 period. The gross loss in the 2024 period was due to the delivery of final prototypes under the Short Range Reconnaissance Tranche 2 contract with the U.S. Army and did not pertain to product sales.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses totaled $1,626,440 during the 2024 period compared to $1,353,551 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $272,889, or 20%. Professional fees totaled $483,129 in the 2024 period compared to $211,883 in the 2023 period. This increase of $271,246, or 128%, primarily related to outsourced software development expenses and represented substantially all of the total increase in research and development costs.\n\nSales and marketing costs totaled $2,041,511 during the 2024 period compared to $1,288,760 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $752,751 or 58%. The increase was driven by higher payroll expenses and an increase in tradeshow attendance to support increased sales efforts of our Teal 2 drone.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $3,483,095 during the 2024 period compared to $2,863,758 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $619,337 or 22%. The increase primarily related to higher stock compensation expense.\n\nDuring the 2024 period, we incurred stock-based compensation costs of $1,446,038 compared to $911,606 in the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $534,432 or 59%.\n\nOther Income\n\nOther expense totaled $4,688,889 during the 2024 period compared to $262,891 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $4,425,998 or more than 16 times. During the 2024 period, we incurred a loss on the sale of our equity method investment of $4,008,357. \n\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\n\nNet loss from continuing operations totaled $12,416,376 for the 2024 period compared to $5,594,295 for the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $6,822,081 or 122%. Total operating expenses totaled $6,407,513 for the 2024 period compared to $5,187,700 for the 2023 period. This increase of $1,219,813 or 24%, primarily to the increase in sales and marketing expenses.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\n**_Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2,348,412 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in operating activities of $6,926,069 during the 2023 period, representing a decrease of $4,577,657 or 66%. The decreased use of cash primarily related to timing of accounts receivable receipts for government customers. Net cash used in operations, net of non-cash expenses, totaled $6,755,639 during the 2024 period, compared to $1,522,611 during the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $5,233,028, or 344%. Net cash used related to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $3,312,325 during the 2024 period, compared to negative $2,854,385 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $6,166,710 or 216%. Changes in operating assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the timing and level of multiple factors, including inventory purchases, vendor payments, and customer collections.\n\n22   \n---  \n  \n**_Investing Activities_**\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $4,300,043 during the 2024 period compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $4,883,345 during the 2023 period, resulting in a decrease of $583,302 or 12%. Proceeds of $4,400,000 from the sale of equity method investment were used to fund operations during the 2024 period.\n\n**_Financing Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $286,037 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in financing activities of $146,509 during the 2023 period. Financing activities can vary from period to period depending upon market conditions, both at a macro-level and specific to the Company.\n\n**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**\n\nAt July 31, 2024, we reported current assets totaling $21,470,151, current liabilities totaling $4,230,512 and net working capital of $17,239,639. Cash totaled $7,732,763 at July 31, 2024. Inventory related balances, including pre-paid inventory, totaled $10,667,676.\n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue our long-term growth strategy. During the three months ended July 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of approximately $12,000,000 and used cash in operating activities of approximately $2,300,000. As of July 31, 2024, working capital totaled approximately $17,200,000. These financial results and our financial position at July 31, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. However, we have recently taken actions to strengthen our liquidity. \n\nOn December 11, 2023, we completed a public offering of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000 as further described in Note 1 and Note 12. In addition, our operating plan for the next twelve months has been updated to reflect recent operating improvements. Revenues have accelerated and are expected to continue growing. Our manufacturing facility is scaling production and gross profits are projected to increase. If necessary, we will seek to obtain additional debt financing for which there can be no guarantee. As described in Note 7, we sold our equity method investment for $4,400,000 in July 2024. As described in Note 18, the Company closed a financing with proceeds of $8 million to be received in late September 2024. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate any substantial doubt about our ability to continue our operations, and meet our financial obligations, for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n\n**_Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_**\n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. \n\nSignificant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets, including goodwill, for impairment, and (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity method investments.\n\n23   \n---  \n  \n**Goodwill and Long-lived Assets** – Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of  _ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,_(“ASC 350”). Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. ASC 350 provides that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the amount that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nThe estimate of fair value of a reporting unit is computed using either an income approach, a market approach, or a combination of both. Under the income approach, we utilize the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. Significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future cash flows, growth assumptions for future revenues (including gross profit, operating expenses, and capital expenditures), and a rate used to discount estimated future cash flow projections to their present value based on estimated weighted average cost of capital (i.e., the selected discount rate). Our assumptions are based on historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management’s plans. Under the market approach, fair value is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate and consider risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. \n\n**Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures** – The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, we have categorized our recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nThe guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\n_Level 1_ : Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n\n_Level 2_ : Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n\n_Level 3_ : Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\n\n_Financial Instruments_\n\nOur financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nWe have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.\n\n24   \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**\n\nWe are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\n\n**ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES**\n\n**Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures**\n\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as of July 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, specifically pertaining to the quarter ended July 31, 2023 for which we restated items related to the removal of the derivative liabilities.\n\nManagement's quarterly report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Board’s audit committee.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n• | pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  \n---|---  \n• | provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  \n• | provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the Internal-Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission.\n\nBased on management’s assessment using the COSO criteria, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, specifically pertaining to the quarter ended July 31, 2023 for which we restated items related to the removal of the derivative liabilities. The Company is currently in the process of formalizing narratives and processes which are expected to mitigate these weaknesses, and has hired additional personnel to strengthen the internal control environment. \n\n25   \n---  \n  \n**Changes In Controls Over Financial Reporting**\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended July 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n**Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures**\n\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\n\n**PART II - OTHER INFORMATION**\n\n**ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**\n\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, some of which may be material. Our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. Other than as described below, we do not believe that the outcome of any of our current legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nOn May 9, 2024, Autonodyne LLC filed a complaint against wholly-owned Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. The Complaint alleges a single cause of action, asserting that Teal breached a Software Licensing Agreement between it and Autonodyne (the “SLA”) by disclosing confidential information contained in the SLA. Autonodyne alleges that it rightfully terminated the SLA, and at that point it became entitled to $8.25 million of accelerated payments, pursuant to section 14.4(e) of the SLA. Teal Drones has answered the Complaint, but no discovery has been served yet. As any litigation is subject to many uncertainties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this claim or to estimate the loss, if any, which may result. Accordingly, the outcome of the claim is not yet determinable, and the extent to which an outflow of funds may be required to settle this possible obligation cannot be reliably determined. The Company plans to vigorously assert defenses to the complaint.\n\n**ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS**\n\nRisk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024, as filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024 (“Annual Report”). There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.\n\n**ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS**\n\nNone.\n\n**ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES**\n\nNone.\n\n26   \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 4.

Any statements in this Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical facts and are forward-looking statements. These\nstatements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “should,” “believes,” “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,”\n“potential,” “continues,” “intends,” “plans” and “would” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. For example, statements concerning financial\ncondition, possible or assumed future results of operations, growth opportunities, and plans are all forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are based on a\nseries of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and\nuncertainty. They involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to differ\nmaterially from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. We may not actually achieve the plans,\nintentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and\nuncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding:\n• the market and sales success of our existing and any new products;\n• our ability to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms;\n• our ability to make acquisitions and integrate acquired businesses into our company;\n• our ability to attract and retain management;\n• the intensity of competition;\n• changes in the political and regulatory environment and in business and economic conditions in the United States and globally; and\n• geopolitical conflicts throughout the world, including those in Ukraine and Israel.\nAll of our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q only. In each case, actual results may differ materially from such forward-\nlooking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of, or any material adverse change\nin, one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic\nreports or other documents or filings filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) could materially and adversely affect our business,\nprospects, financial condition and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake or plan to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to\nreflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other circumstances affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q, even if such results, changes or circumstances make it clear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements\nor disclosures by us following this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-\nQ will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may include market data and certain industry data and forecasts, which we may obtain from internal company surveys, market research,\nconsultant surveys, publicly available information, reports of governmental agencies and industry publications, articles and surveys. Industry surveys, publications, consultant\nsurveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of such\ninformation is not guaranteed. While we believe that such studies and publications are reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party\nsources. Given these uncertainties, readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We disclaim\nany obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or\ndevelopments.\nAll references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”, are to Red Cat Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, including its wholly owned\nconsolidated subsidiaries Skypersonic, Inc.

Since April 2016, the Company’s primary business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the\ndrone industry which it presently does through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Beginning in January 2020, the Company expanded the scope of its drone products and\nservices through four acquisitions, including:\nA. In January 2020, the Company acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (“FPV”) drones and equipment, primarily to consumers. The purchase price was\n$1,995,114.\nB. In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings, Ltd. (“Fat Shark”), a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was\n$8,354,076.\nC. In May 2021, the Company acquired Skypersonic which provided hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where\nGPS is either denied or not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.\nD. In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal Drones, Inc. (“Teal”), a leader in commercial and government Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (“UAV”) technology. The\npurchase price was $10,011,279.\nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment\n(“Enterprise”) and the Consumer segment (“Consumer”) to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial\nenterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-\nterm attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects the Company's decision to\nfocus its efforts and capital on defense where it believes that there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value. See Note 3 and Note 7.\nOn December 11, 2023, the Company completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering with ThinkEquity of1 8,400,000 shares of common stock which generated\ngross proceeds of $9,200,000 and net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000.\nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation – The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information and with the instructions of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not\ninclude all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal\nrecurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation with respect to the interim financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three months ended\nJuly 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year ending April 30, 2025. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and\nfootnotes thereto for the year ended April 30, 2024, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRestatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements – The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Stockholders’ Equity for the\nthree months ended July 31, 2023, which were originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 19, 2023, have been restated. The\nCompany revised its financial statements to remove derivative liabilities due to erroneously reporting warrants from our convertible note financings, as described in Note 14, as\nhaving a derivative component.\n7\nThe impacts of these restatements are detailed in the tables below:\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Operations\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2023\nOriginally As\nReported Restated Change\nChange in fair value of derivative liability $ (26,520) $ — $ (26,520)\nNet loss $ (5,810,348) $ (5,836,868) $ (26,520)\nCondensed Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2023\nOriginally As\nReported Restated Change\nAdditional paid-in capital $ 110,905,033 $ 113,554,659 $ 2,649,626\nAccumulated deficit $ (60,397,141) $ (62,914,971) $ (2,517,830)\nTotal equity $ 49,993,398 $ 50,125,194 $ 131,796\nPrinciples of Consolidation – Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries which include Teal and Skypersonic as\nwell as Rotor Riot and Fat Shark through the sale date of February 16, 2024. Non-majority owned investments, including the formerly wholly owned subsidiaries Rotor Riot\nand Fat Shark, are accounted for using the equity method when the Company is able to significantly influence the operating policies of the investee. Intercompany transactions\nand balances have been eliminated.\nThe Consumer segment businesses are characterized as discontinued operations in these financial statements. The operating results and cash flows of discontinued operations\nare separately stated in those respective financial statements. See Note 3.\nUse of Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price\naccounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets, including goodwill, for impairment, and (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity\nmethod investments.\nConcentration of Credit Risk – Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, include trade receivables. In the normal course\nof business, the Company provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, generally does not require\ncollateral and considers the credit risk profile of the customer from which the receivable is due in further evaluating collection risk. Customers that accounted for 10% or greater\nof accounts receivable, net as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024 were as follows:\nJuly 31, 2024 April 30, 2024\nCustomer A 38% 53%\nCustomer B 25% 24%\nAs of July 31, 2024, three customers accounted for equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue, totaling 32%, 20% and 12%, respectively. As of July 31, 2023, three customers\naccounted for equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue, totaling 13%, 12% and 10%, respectively.\n8\nEquity Method Investment – The equity method of accounting is applied to investments in which the Company has an ownership interest of between 20% and 50%. The\nCompany evaluates its equity method investments each reporting period for evidence of a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline. Evidence of a loss in value might\ninclude, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings\ncapacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company performed this analysis and concluded that its investment in UMAC was other-than-\ntemporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge of $11,353,875 for the year ended April 30, 2024. See Note 7 for additional information.\nFair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities, and Related Disclosures – The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance\ndefines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an\nexit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis\nfinancial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs\n(Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair\nvalue measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's\nassessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2: Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related\nassets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\nThe Company's financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of these\ninstruments approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.\nRevenue Recognition – The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (“FASB”). This standard includes a comprehensive evaluation of factors to be considered regarding revenue recognition including (i) identifying the promised\ngoods, (ii) evaluating performance obligations, (iii) measuring the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations if there are multiple\ncomponents, and (v) recognizing revenue as each obligation is satisfied. The Company’s revenue transactions include the shipment of goods to customers as orders are fulfilled,\ncompletion of non-recurring engineering, completion of training, and customer support services. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product or prototypes\nunless otherwise specified in the purchase order or contract. Customer deposits totaled $50,039 and $53,939 at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. From time to\ntime, non-recurring engineering contracts may involve the capitalization of engineering prototypes, classified as contract assets. Contract assets totaled $0 and $1,477,859 at\nJuly 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by revenue type:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n2024 2023\nContract related $ 886,440 $ 310,881\nProduct related 1,890,095 1,437,248\nTotal $ 2,776,535 $ 1,748,129\n9\nProduct Warranty - The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based upon both current and historical product sales data and warranty costs\nincurred. Product warranty reserves are recorded in current liabilities under accrued expenses. Warranty liability was approximately $541,000 and $372,000 as of July 31, 2024\nand April 30, 2024 respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – Management does not believe that recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a\nmaterial effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nComprehensive Loss – Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an\nelement of stockholders' equity but are excluded from net loss. Our other comprehensive loss is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or\nlosses on available-for-sale securities. During the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, comprehensive loss was $4,621 higher and $291,035 lower than net loss,\nrespectively, related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities totaling $0 and $289,389, respectively, and foreign currency translation adjustments of $4,621 and\n$1,646.\nBasic and Diluted Net Loss per Share – Basic and diluted net loss per share has been calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common\nstock outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock because they were anti-\ndilutive. The conversion or exercise of these common stock equivalents would dilute earnings per share if we become profitable in the future. Outstanding securities not\nincluded in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive include:\nJuly 31, 2024 July 31, 2023\nSeries B Preferred Stock, as converted 3,896 3,896\nStock options 7,319,988 6,884,017\nWarrants 1,821,291 1,539,999\nRestricted stock 2,202,599 842,701\nTotal 11,347,774 9,270,613\nRelated Parties – Parties are considered to be related to us if they have control or significant influence, directly or indirectly, over us, including key management personnel and\nmembers of the Board of Directors or are direct relatives of key management personnel of members of the Board of Directors. Related Party transactions are disclosed in Note\n16.\nLiquidity and Going Concern – The Company has never been profitable and has incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue its long-term\ngrowth strategy. During the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of approximately $12,000,000 and used cash in operating activities of\napproximately $2,300,000. As of July 31, 2024, working capital totaled approximately $17,200,000. These financial results and our financial position at July 31, 2024 raise\nsubstantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. However, the Company has recently taken actions to strengthen its liquidity. On December 11, 2023, we\ncompleted a public offering of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000 as further described in Note 1 and Note 12. In\naddition, the Company’s operating plan for the next twelve months has been updated to reflect recent operating improvements. Revenues have accelerated and are expected to\ncontinue growing. The Company’s manufacturing facility is scaling production and gross profits are projected to increase. If necessary, the Company will seek to obtain\nadditional debt financing for which there can be no guarantee. As described in Note 7, the Company sold its equity method investment for $4,400,000 in July 2024. As\ndescribed in Note 18, the Company closed a financing with proceeds of $8 million to be received in late September 2024. Management has concluded that these recent positive\ndevelopments alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue its operations, and meet its financial obligations, for twelve months from the date these\nconsolidated financial statements are issued.\nNote 3 – Divestiture of Consumer Segment\nOn February 16, 2024, the Company closed the sale of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark to Unusual Machines. The sale was conducted pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated\nNovember 21, 2022, as amended on April 13, 2023, July 10, 2023, and December 11, 2023 (the “SPA”). The transaction closed concurrently with UMAC’s initial public\noffering and listing on the NYSE American exchange (“IPO”) under the symbol “UMAC.”\nThe total consideration received by the Company was valued at $20 million and consisted of i) $1 million in cash, ii) $2 million in a secured promissory note (“Promissory\nNote”), iii) $17 million in securities of Unusual Machines, and iv) a post-closing adjustment for excess working capital.\n10\nSecured Promissory Note\nThe Promissory Note from Unusual Machines bears interest at a rate of 8% per year, is due 18 months from the date of issue, and requires monthly payments of interest due in\narrears on the 15th day of each month. In the event of a Qualified Financing (defined as one or more related debt or equity financings by UMAC resulting in net proceeds of at\nleast $5 million, other than UMAC’s completed IPO), the Company may require payment of this Promissory Note in whole or in part upon written notice given within 10 days\nof the Qualified Financing. During the occurrence and continuance of any event of default under the Note, the Company may, at its option, convert the amounts due under the\nNote to common stock of UMAC in whole or in part from time to time. The conversion price will be a 10% discount to the average daily volume weighted average price for\nUMAC’s common stock over the 10 days preceding the conversion price. Conversions under the Note will be limited such that no conversion may be made to the extent that,\nafter giving effect to the conversion, the Company, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of UMAC’s common stock. This limit may be\nincreased by the Company upon 61 days written notice.\nUnusual Machines Securities\nThe $17 million worth of UMAC common stock was valued at the IPO price for UMAC’s common stock of $4.00 per share, resulting in4 ,250,000 shares of UMAC common\nstock being issued to the Company (representing approximately 49% of UMAC’s issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to the IPO and to the issuance of\ncommon stock to the Company upon closing of the IPO).\nWorking Capital\nThe purchase price was adjusted for working capital as of the closing date.

(“Buyer”), and FlightWave Aerospace Systems Corporation (“Seller”) entered into and closed on the\ntransactions set forth in an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA” and the transactions set forth therein, the “Transactions”), pursuant to which Buyer purchased and Seller sold\ncertain assets used in designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling long range, AI-powered UAVs for commercial use.\nAs a condition to the closing of the Transactions, each of the shareholders of the Seller entered into a Joinder Agreement with the Company, Teal and Buyer pursuant to which\nsuch shareholder agreed to the terms of the APA and agreed to be bound by the provisions thereof applicable to the Seller’s shareholders, including without limit, the\nindemnification provisions in the APA.\nThe purchase price under the APA is equal to $14 million worth of shares of the Company’s common stock which are payable as follows:\n• $7 million worth of the Company’s common stock to be issued on September 30, 2024, at a price per share equal to the VWAP on such date, which shall be payable to\nthe preferred shareholders of the Seller as set forth in the APA.\n• $7 million worth of the Company’s common stock to be issued on December 31, 2024, at a price per share equal to the VWAP on such date, of which (i) $2 million will\nbe payable to preferred shareholders of the Seller, and (ii) $5 million will be payable to common shareholders and option-holders of the Seller as set forth the APA.\nOn September 23, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with Lind Global Asset Management X LLC (“Lind”). Under the SPA, within days of\nclosing, we will receive $8 million in funding from Lind in exchange for our issuance to Lind of a Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of $9,600,000\n(the “Note”) and a Common Stock Purchase Warrant for the purchase of 750,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $6.50 per share, exercisable for 5 years (the\n“Warrant”). As addition consideration to Lind, we have agreed to pay a commitment fee in the amount of $280,000, which may be paid by deduction from the funding to be\nreceived. The Note, which does not accrue interest, shall be repaid in eighteen (18) consecutive monthly installments in the amount of $533,334 beginning six months from the\nissuance date.\n20\nPlan of Operations\nSince April 2016, our primary business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which we presently do through our three wholly owned\nsubsidiaries Skypersonic, Teal, and Propware. Beginning in January 2020, we expanded the scope of our drone products and services through four acquisitions, including:\nA. In January 2020, we acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (FPV) drones and equipment, primarily to the consumer marketplace. The purchase price was\n$1,995,114.\nB. In November 2020, we acquired Fat Shark Holdings, a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was $8,354,076.\nC. In May 2021, we acquired Skypersonic which provides hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is not\navailable, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.\nD. In August 2021, we acquired Teal, a leader in commercial and government UAV technology, primarily drones, to government and commercial enterprises, most notably,\nthe military. Teal manufactures drones approved by the U.S. Department of Defense for reconnaissance, public safety, and inspection applications. The purchase price\nwas $10,011,279.\nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment\n(“Enterprise”) and the Consumer segment (“Consumer”) to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial\nenterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-\nterm attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\nThe Enterprise segment’s current business strategy is focused on providing integrated robotic hardware and software for use across a variety of applications. Its solutions\nprovide critical situational awareness and actionable intelligence to on-the-ground warfighters and battlefield commanders as well as firefighters and public safety officials. Our\nEnterprise segment’s efforts are centered on developing and scaling an American made family of systems. We have since completed construction of a manufacturing facility in\nSalt Lake City, Utah and believe that an increased focus by the United States government and American businesses on purchasing products that are “Made in America” provide\nour Enterprise segment with a competitive advantage.\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects our decision to focus our\nefforts and capital on defense where we believe there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value.\nOn September 4, 2024, we entered into and closed on the transactions set forth in an Asset Purchase Agreement with FlightWave pursuant to which we purchased certain assets\nfor designing, developing, manufacturing, and selling long range, AI-powered UAVs for commercial use. Please refer to the Recent Developments section above for further\ninformation regarding the APA and related transactions.\nResults of Operations\nThe analysis of our results of operations for the three months ended July 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended July 31, 2023 includes only our Enterprise segment as\nour Consumer segment was divested in February 2024.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Three Months Ended July 31, 2024 compared to Three Months Ended July 31, 2023\nRevenues\nConsolidated revenues totaled $2,776,535 during the three months ended July 31, 2024 (or the “2024 period”) compared to $1,748,129 during the three months ended July 31,\n2023 (or the “2023 period”) representing an increase of $1,028,406, or 59%. The increase related to higher product revenue and higher contract revenue. Product revenue totaled\n$1,890,095 during the quarter ended July 31, 2024 compared to $1,437,248 during the quarter ended July 31, 2023 representing an increase of $452,847, or 32%. Contract\nrevenues totaled $886,440 during the 2024 period compared to $310,881 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $575,559, or 185%. Contract revenues are primarily\nsourced through government agencies and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of award deliverables and amendments.\n21\nGross Profit\nConsolidated gross loss totaled $483,391 during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of $174,665 during the 2023 period representing a decrease of $658,056, or 377%.\nOn a percentage basis, gross loss was 17% during the 2024 period compared to a gross profit of 10% during the 2023 period. The gross loss in the 2024 period was due to the\ndelivery of final prototypes under the Short Range Reconnaissance Tranche 2 contract with the U.S. Army and did not pertain to product sales.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and development expenses totaled $1,626,440 during the 2024 period compared to $1,353,551 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $272,889, or 20%.\nProfessional fees totaled $483,129 in the 2024 period compared to $211,883 in the 2023 period. This increase of $271,246, or 128%, primarily related to outsourced software\ndevelopment expenses and represented substantially all of the total increase in research and development costs.\nSales and marketing costs totaled $2,041,511 during the 2024 period compared to $1,288,760 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $752,751 or 58%. The increase\nwas driven by higher payroll expenses and an increase in tradeshow attendance to support increased sales efforts of our Teal 2 drone.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $3,483,095 during the 2024 period compared to $2,863,758 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $619,337 or 22%.\nThe increase primarily related to higher stock compensation expense.\nDuring the 2024 period, we incurred stock-based compensation costs of $1,446,038 compared to $911,606 in the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $534,432 or 59%.\nOther Income\nOther expense totaled $4,688,889 during the 2024 period compared to $262,891 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $4,425,998 or more than 16 times. During\nthe 2024 period, we incurred a loss on the sale of our equity method investment of $4,008,357.\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\nNet loss from continuing operations totaled $12,416,376 for the 2024 period compared to $5,594,295 for the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $6,822,081 or 122%. Total\noperating expenses totaled $6,407,513 for the 2024 period compared to $5,187,700 for the 2023 period. This increase of $1,219,813 or 24%, primarily to the increase in sales\nand marketing expenses.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $2,348,412 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in operating activities of $6,926,069 during the 2023 period, representing\na decrease of $4,577,657 or 66%. The decreased use of cash primarily related to timing of accounts receivable receipts for government customers. Net cash used in operations,\nnet of non-cash expenses, totaled $6,755,639 during the 2024 period, compared to $1,522,611 during the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $5,233,028, or 344%. Net cash\nused related to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $3,312,325 during the 2024 period, compared to negative $2,854,385 during the 2023 period, representing an\nincrease of $6,166,710 or 216%. Changes in operating assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the timing and level of multiple\nfactors, including inventory purchases, vendor payments, and customer collections.\n22\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $4,300,043 during the 2024 period compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $4,883,345 during the 2023 period,\nresulting in a decrease of $583,302 or 12%. Proceeds of $4,400,000 from the sale of equity method investment were used to fund operations during the 2024 period.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $286,037 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in financing activities of $146,509 during the 2023 period. Financing\nactivities can vary from period to period depending upon market conditions, both at a macro-level and specific to the Company.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt July 31, 2024, we reported current assets totaling $21,470,151, current liabilities totaling $4,230,512 and net working capital of $17,239,639. Cash totaled $7,732,763 at\nJuly 31, 2024. Inventory related balances, including pre-paid inventory, totaled $10,667,676.\nGoing Concern\nWe have never been profitable and have incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue our long-term growth strategy. During the three months\nended July 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss of approximately $12,000,000 and used cash in operating activities of approximately $2,300,000. As of July 31, 2024, working\ncapital totaled approximately $17,200,000. These financial results and our financial position at July 31, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going\nconcern. However, we have recently taken actions to strengthen our liquidity.\nOn December 11, 2023, we completed a public offering of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000 as further described\nin Note 1 and Note 12. In addition, our operating plan for the next twelve months has been updated to reflect recent operating improvements. Revenues have accelerated and\nare expected to continue growing. Our manufacturing facility is scaling production and gross profits are projected to increase. If necessary, we will seek to obtain additional debt\nfinancing for which there can be no guarantee. As described in Note 7, we sold our equity method investment for $4,400,000 in July 2024. As described in Note 18, the\nCompany closed a financing with proceeds of $8 million to be received in late September 2024. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate\nany substantial doubt about our ability to continue our operations, and meet our financial obligations, for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial\nstatements are issued.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in\nconformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to\nour financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions\nthat are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nSignificant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets,\nincluding goodwill, for impairment, and (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity method investments.\n23\nGoodwill and Long-lived Assets – Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are not individually identified and\nseparately recognized. We test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other, (“ASC 350”). Goodwill is tested for\nimpairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. ASC 350 provides that an\nentity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required\nto perform an impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair\nvalue exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment loss is\nrecognized in an amount equal to the amount that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting\nunit.\nThe estimate of fair value of a reporting unit is computed using either an income approach, a market approach, or a combination of both. Under the income approach, we utilize\nthe discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. Significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future cash\nflows, growth assumptions for future revenues (including gross profit, operating expenses, and capital expenditures), and a rate used to discount estimated future cash flow\nprojections to their present value based on estimated weighted average cost of capital (i.e., the selected discount rate). Our assumptions are based on historical data,\nsupplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management’s plans. Under the market approach, fair value is derived from metrics of\npublicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the\nreporting units operate and consider risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services.\nFair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures – The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance\ndefines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an\nexit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, we have categorized our recurring basis financial\nassets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs\n(Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair\nvalue measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the\nsignificance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\nLevel 2: Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or\nliabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related\nassets or liabilities; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, current\nassets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless\notherwise disclosed, and we do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial\nposition or results of operations.\n24\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are not required to provide the information required by this Item as we are a “smaller reporting company,” as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as of July 31, 2024, the end of the period\ncovered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means\ncontrols and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act\nis recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,\ncontrols and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to a company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of July 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that,\nas of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, specifically pertaining to the quarter ended July 31, 2023 for which we restated items related to the\nremoval of the derivative liabilities.\nManagement's quarterly report on internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to\nprovide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our\naccounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Board’s audit committee.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n• pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n• provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and\nexpenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n• provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to\nfuture periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures\nmay deteriorate.\nManagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the\nmeasures in the Internal-Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on management’s assessment using the COSO criteria, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, specifically\npertaining to the quarter ended July 31, 2023 for which we restated items related to the removal of the derivative liabilities. The Company is currently in the process of\nformalizing narratives and processes which are expected to mitigate these weaknesses, and has hired additional personnel to strengthen the internal control environment.\n25\nChanges In Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended July 31,\n2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot\nprovide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances\nof fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and\nthat management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business, some of which may be material. Our businesses\nare also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. Other than as described below, we do not believe that the outcome of any of our\ncurrent legal proceedings will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn May 9, 2024, Autonodyne LLC filed a complaint against wholly-owned Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. The Complaint\nalleges a single cause of action, asserting that Teal breached a Software Licensing Agreement between it and Autonodyne (the “SLA”) by disclosing confidential information\ncontained in the SLA. Autonodyne alleges that it rightfully terminated the SLA, and at that point it became entitled to $8.25 million of accelerated payments, pursuant to section\n14.4(e) of the SLA. Teal Drones has answered the Complaint, but no discovery has been served yet. As any litigation is subject to many uncertainties, it is not possible to predict\nthe ultimate outcome of this claim or to estimate the loss, if any, which may result. Accordingly, the outcome of the claim is not yet determinable, and the extent to which an\noutflow of funds may be required to settle this possible obligation cannot be reliably determined. The Company plans to vigorously assert defenses to the complaint.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024,\nas filed with the SEC on August 8, 2024 (“Annual Report”). There have been no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in\nour Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could\nbe negatively affected.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nNone.\nITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES\nNone.\n26\nITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable\nITEM 5.

No course of\ndelay on the part of the Holder shall operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice the rights of the Holder. No remedy conferred hereby\nshall be exclusive of any other remedy referred to herein or now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.\nARTICLE 3\n3.1 Conversion.\n(a) Conversion. This Note shall be convertible (in whole or in part), at the option of the Holder, into such number of fully paid\nand non-assessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing (x) that portion of the Outstanding Principal Amount that the\nHolder elects to convert (the “Conversion Amount”) by (y) the Conversion Price then in effect on the date on which the Holder delivers a\nnotice of conversion, in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit B (the “Conversion Notice”), in accordance with Section 5.1 to the\nMaker. Any such conversion pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) and any additional payments made pursuant to Section 1.3 shall be applied to\nprepay future Monthly Payments in chronological order, (i.e. if a conversion or excess monthly payment is increased (from $400,000 to\n$800,000 at the Company’s option), those conversions would apply towards the next upcoming payment(s)). The Holder shall deliver this\nNote to the Maker at the address designated in the Purchase Agreement at such time that this Note is fully converted. With respect to partial\nconversions of this Note, the Maker shall keep written records of the amount of this Note converted as of the Conversion Date.\n(b) Conversion Price. The “Conversion Price” means $6.50and shall be subject to adjustment as provided herein.\n3.2 Delivery of Conversion Shares. As soon as practicable after the occurrence of any event requiring the issuance of shares of\nCommon Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note (“Conversion Shares”), and in any event within two (2) Business Day thereafter (such\ndate, the “Share Delivery Date”), the Maker shall, at its expense, cause to be issued in the name of and delivered to the Holder, or as the Holder\nmay direct, the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled, in such denominations\nas may be requested by the Holder, which certificate or certificates shall be free of restrictive and trading legends, except for any such legends\nas may be required under the 1933 Act. The Company shall cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit such shares of Common Stock\nissuable to the Holder (or its designee), by crediting the account of the Holder’s (or such designee’s) broker with the Depository Trust\nCompany (“DTC”) through its Deposit and Withdrawal At Custodian (“DWAC”) system (provided that the same time periods herein as for\nstock certificates shall apply) as instructed by the Holder (or its designee); provided, that such issuance shall only be made through DTC’s\nDWAC system if such Conversion Shares will be issued free of restrictive legends. If such Conversion Shares will be issued subject to legends\nrequired under the 1933 Act, such Conversion Shares will be issued to the Holder in book entry at the Maker’s transfer agent.\n3.3 Ownership Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holder shall not be entitled to receive shares\nrepresenting Equity Interests upon conversion of this Note to the extent (but only to the extent) that such exercise or receipt would cause the\nHolder Group (as defined below) to become, directly or indirectly, a “beneficial owner” (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act\nand the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) of a number of Equity Interests of a class that is registered under the 1934 Act which\nexceeds the Maximum Percentage (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of the Equity Interests of such class that are outstanding at such\ntime. Any purported delivery of Equity Interests in connection with the conversion of this Note prior to the termination of this restriction in\naccordance herewith shall be void and have no effect to the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in the Holder Group\nbecoming the beneficial owner of more than the Maximum Percentage of the Equity Interests of a class that is registered under the 1934 Act\nthat is outstanding at such time. If any delivery of Equity Interests owed to the Holder following conversion of this Note is not made, in whole\nor in part, as a result of this limitation, the Company’s obligation to make such delivery shall not be extinguished and the Company shall\ndeliver such Equity Interests as promptly as practicable after the Holder gives notice to the Company that such delivery would not result in such\nlimitation being triggered or upon termination of the restriction in accordance with the terms hereof. To the extent limitations contained in this\nSection 3.3 apply, the determination of whether this Note is convertible and of which portion of this Note is convertible shall be the sole\nresponsibility and in the sole determination of the Holder, and the submission of a notice of conversion shall be deemed to constitute the\nHolder’s determination that the issuance of the full number of Conversion Shares requested in the notice of conversion is permitted hereunder,\nand the Company shall not have any obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. For purposes of this Section 3.3, (i) the\nterm “Maximum Percentage” shall mean 4.99%; provided, that if at any time after the date hereof the Holder Group beneficially owns in\nexcess of 4.99% of any class of Equity Interests in the Company that is registered under the 1934 Act, then the Maximum Percentage shall\nautomatically increase to 9.99% so long as the Holder Group owns in excess of 4.99% of such class of Equity Interests (and shall, for the\navoidance of doubt, automatically decrease to 4.99% upon the Holder Group ceasing to own in excess of 4.99% of such class of Equity\nInterests); and (ii) the term “Holder Group” shall mean the Holder plus any other Person with which the Holder is considered to be part of a\ngroup under Section 13 of the 1934 Act or with which the Holder otherwise files reports under Sections 13 and/or 16 of the 1934 Act. In\ndetermining the number of Equity Interests of a particular class outstanding at any point in time, the Holder may rely on the number of\noutstanding Equity Interests of such class as reflected in (x) the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) a more recent notice by the\nCompany or its transfer agent to the Holder setting forth the number of Equity Interests of such class then outstanding. For any reason at any\ntime, upon written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall, within one (1) Business Day of such request, confirm orally and in writing\nto the Holder the number of Equity Interests of any class then outstanding. The provisions of this Section 3.3 shall be construed, corrected and\nimplemented in a manner so as to effectuate the intended beneficial ownership limitation herein contained.[1]\n[1] Note to draft: Parties to confirm blocker percentage.\n3.4 Adjustment of Conversion Price.\n(a) Until the Note has been paid in full or converted in full, the Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to\ntime as follows (but shall not be increased, other than pursuant to Section 3.4(a)(i) hereof):\n(i) Adjustments for Stock Splits and Combinations. If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the\nClosing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date) effect a split or other subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the\napplicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the stock or share split shall be proportionately decreased. If the Maker shall at any\ntime or from time to time after the Closing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date), combine the outstanding shares of Common\nStock, the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to the combination shall be proportionately increased. Any adjustments\nunder this Section 3.4(a)(i) shall be effective at the close of business on the date the stock split or combination occurs.\n(ii) Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions. If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the\nClosing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date) make or issue or set a record date for the determination of holders of Common\nStock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, then, and in each event, the applicable\nConversion Price in effect immediately prior to such event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such record date\nshall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the applicable Conversion Price then in effect by a\nfraction:\n(1) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date; and\n(2) the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding\nimmediately prior to the time of such issuance or the close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock\nissuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.\n(iii) Adjustment for Other Dividends and Distributions. If the Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the\nClosing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date) make or issue or set a record date for the determination of holders of Common\nStock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in other than shares of Common Stock, then, and in each event, an appropriate\nrevision to the applicable Conversion Price shall be made and provision shall be made (by adjustments of the Conversion Price or otherwise) so\nthat the Holder of this Note shall receive upon conversions thereof, in addition to the number of shares of Common Stock receivable thereon,\nthe number of securities of the Maker or other issuer (as applicable) or cash or other property that it would have received had this Note been\nconverted into Common Stock in full (without regard to any conversion limitations herein) on the date of such event and had thereafter, during\nthe period from the date of such event to and including the Conversion Date, retained such securities (together with any distributions payable\nthereon during such period) or assets, giving application to all adjustments called for during such period under this Section 3.4(a)(iii) with\nrespect to the rights of the holders of this Note; provided, however, that if such record date shall have been fixed and such dividend is not fully\npaid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this paragraph as of\nthe time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions.\n(iv) Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution. If the Common Stock at any time or from time to\ntime after the Closing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date) shall be changed to the same or different number of shares or other\nsecurities of any class or classes of stock or other property, whether by reclassification, exchange, substitution or otherwise (other than by way\nof a stock split or combination of shares or stock dividends provided for in Sections 3.4(a)(i), (ii) and (iii) hereof, or a reorganization, merger,\nconsolidation, or sale of assets provided for in Section 3.4(a)(vii) hereof), then, and in each event, an appropriate revision to the Conversion\nPrice shall be made and provisions shall be made (by adjustments of the Conversion Price or otherwise) so that the Holder shall have the right\nthereafter to convert this Note into the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or other property receivable upon reclassification,\nexchange, substitution or other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Note might have been converted\nimmediately prior to such reclassification, exchange, substitution or other change, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.\n(v) Adjustments for Issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock. Except for Exempted Securities, in the event\nthe Maker shall at any time or from time to time after the Closing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date) issue or sell any\nadditional shares of Common Stock (“Additional Shares of Common Stock”) at an effective price per share that is less than the Conversion\nPrice then in effect or without consideration, then the Conversion Price upon each such issuance shall be reduced to a price equal to the\nconsideration per share paid for such Additional Shares of Common Stock. For purposes of clarification, the amount of consideration received\nfor such Additional Shares of Common Stock shall not include the value of any additional securities or other rights received in connection with\nsuch issuance of Additional Shares of Common Stock (i.e. warrants, rights of first refusal or other similar rights).\n(vi) Issuance, Amendment or Adjustment of Common Stock Equivalents. Except for Exempted Securities, if (x) the\nMaker, at any time after the Closing Date (but whether before or after the Issuance Date), shall issue any securities convertible into or\nexercisable or exchangeable for, directly or indirectly, Common Stock (“Convertible Securities”), or any rights or warrants or options to\npurchase any such Common Stock or Convertible Securities, (collectively with the Convertible Securities, the “Common Stock Equivalents”)\nand the price per share for which shares of Common Stock may be issuable pursuant to any such Common Stock Equivalent shall be less than\nthe applicable Conversion Price then in effect, or (y) the price per share for which shares of Common Stock may be issuable under any\nCommon Stock Equivalents is amended or adjusted, pursuant to the terms of such Common Stock Equivalents or otherwise, and such price as\nso amended or adjusted shall be less than the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such amendment or adjustment, then, in each such case\n(x) or (y), the Conversion Price upon each such issuance or amendment or adjustment shall be adjusted as provided in subsection (v) of this\nSection 3.4(a) as if the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Common Stock\nEquivalents had been issued on the date of such issuance or amendment or adjustment.\n(vii) Consideration for Stock. In case any shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents shall be issued\nor sold:\n(1) in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the Maker is the surviving corporation (other\nthan any consolidation or merger in which the previously outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Maker shall be changed to or exchanged\nfor the stock or other securities of another corporation), the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value, as\ndetermined reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Maker, of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving\ncorporation as such Board of Directors may determine to be attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities, rights or\nwarrants or options, as the case may be; or\n(2) in the event of any consolidation or merger of the Maker in which the Maker is not the surviving\ncorporation or in which the previously outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Maker shall be changed into or exchanged for the stock or\nother securities of another corporation or other property, or in the event of any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Maker for\nstock, shares or other securities or other property of any corporation, the Maker shall be deemed to have issued shares of its Common Stock, at\na price per share equal to the valuation of the Maker’s Common Stock based on the actual exchange ratio on which the transaction was\npredicated, as applicable, and the fair market value on the date of such transaction of all such stock or securities or other property of the other\ncorporation. If any such calculation results in adjustment of the applicable Conversion Price, or the number of shares of Common Stock\nissuable upon conversion of the Note, the determination of the applicable Conversion Price or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable\nupon conversion of the Note immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or sale, shall be made after giving effect to such adjustment of the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note. In the event Common Stock is issued with other shares or securities\nor other assets of the Maker for consideration which covers both, the consideration computed as provided in this Section 3.4(a)(vii) shall be\nallocated among such securities and assets as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Maker\n(viii) Record Date. In case the Maker shall take record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling\nthem to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities, then the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock\nshall be deemed to be such record date.\n(b) No Impairment. The Maker shall not, by amendment of its Organizational Documents or through any reorganization,\ntransfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the\nobservance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Maker, but will at all times in good faith assist\nin the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 3.4 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to\nprotect the conversion rights of the Holder against impairment. In the event the Holder shall elect to convert this Note as provided herein, the\nMaker cannot refuse conversion based on any claim that the Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder has been engaged in\nany violation of law, violation of an agreement to which the Holder is a party or for any reason whatsoever, unless, an injunction from a court,\nor notice, restraining and or adjoining conversion of this Note shall have issued and the Maker posts a surety bond for the benefit of the\nHolder in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Principal Amount of the Note the Holder has elected to convert, which\nbond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to the Holder\n(as liquidated damages) in the event it obtains judgment.\n(c) Certificates as to Adjustments. Upon occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price or number of\nshares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note pursuant to this Section 3.4, the Maker at its expense shall promptly compute\nsuch adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment and\nreadjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Maker shall, upon written request of the\nHolder, at any time, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Holder a like certificate setting forth such adjustments and readjustments, the\napplicable Conversion Price in effect at the time, and the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or\nproperty which at the time would be received upon the conversion of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Maker shall not be\nobligated to deliver a certificate unless such certificate would reflect an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of such adjusted\namount.\n(d) Issue Taxes. The Maker shall pay any and all issue and other taxes, excluding federal, state or local income taxes, that\nmay be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common Stock on conversion of this Note pursuant thereto; provided,\nhowever, that the Maker shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by the Holder in connection with\nany such conversion.\n(e) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of this Note. In lieu of any\nfractional shares to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Maker shall pay cash equal such fractional shares multiplied by the\nConversion Price then in effect.\n(f) Reservation of Common Stock. The Maker shall at all times while this Note shall be outstanding, reserve and keep\navailable out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient\nto effect the conversion of this Note (disregarding for this purpose any and all limitations of any kind on such conversion). The Maker shall,\nfrom time to time, use all commercially reasonable efforts to increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock or take other\neffective action if at any time the unissued number of authorized shares shall not be sufficient to satisfy the Maker’s obligations under this\nSection 3.4(f).\n(g) Regulatory Compliance. If any shares of Common Stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of this Note require\nregistration or listing with or approval of any governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory body under any federal or state law\nor regulation or otherwise before such shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the Maker shall, at its sole cost and\nexpense, in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may be.\n(h) Effect of Events Prior to the Issuance Date. If the Issuance Date of this Note is after the Closing Date, then, if the\nConversion Price or any other right of the Holder of this Note would have been adjusted or modified by operation of any provision of this\nNote had this Note been issued on the Closing Date, such adjustment or modification shall be deemed to apply to this Note as of the Issuance\nDate as if this Note had been issued on the Closing Date.\n3.5 Prepayment Following a Change of Control.\n(a) Mechanics of Prepayment at Option of Holder in Connection with a Change of Control. No sooner than fifteen (15) days\nprior to entry into an agreement for a Change of Control nor later than ten (10) days prior to the consummation of a Change of Control, but\nnot prior to the public announcement of such Change of Control, the Maker shall deliver written notice (“Notice of Change of Control”) to the\nHolder. At any time after receipt of a Notice of Change of Control (or, in the event a Notice of Change of Control is not delivered at least ten\n(10) days prior to a Change of Control, at any time within ten (10) days prior to a Change of Control), the Holder may require the Maker to\nprepay, effective immediately prior to the consummation of such Change of Control, an amount equal to 102.5% of the Outstanding Principal\nAmount (the “COC Repayment Price”), by delivering written notice thereof (“Notice of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Change of\nControl”) to the Maker.\n(b) Payment of COC Repayment Price. Upon the Maker’s receipt of a Notice(s) of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon\nChange of Control from the Holder, the Maker shall deliver the COC Repayment Price to the Holder immediately prior to the consummation\nof the Change of Control; provided that the Holder’s original Note shall have been so delivered to the Maker.\n3.6 Inability to Fully Convert.\n(a) Holder’s Option if Maker Cannot Fully Convert. If, upon the Maker’s receipt of a Conversion Notice or as otherwise\nrequired under this Note, including with respect to repayment of principal in shares of Common Stock as permitted under this Note, the Maker\ncannot issue shares of Common Stock for any reason, including, without limitation, because the Maker (x) does not have a sufficient number\nof shares of Common Stock authorized and available or (y) is otherwise prohibited by applicable law or by the rules or regulations of any\nstock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Maker or any of its securities\nfrom issuing all of the Common Stock which is to be issued to the Holder pursuant to this Note, then the Maker shall issue as many shares of\nCommon Stock as it is able to issue and, with respect to the unconverted portion of this Note or with respect to any shares of Common Stock\nnot timely issued in accordance with this Note, the Holder, solely at Holder’s option, can elect to:\n(i) require the Maker to prepay that portion of this Note for which the Maker is unable to issue Common Stock or\nfor which shares of Common Stock were not timely issued (the “Mandatory Prepayment”) at a price equal to the number of shares of Common\nStock that the Maker is unable to issue multiplied by the VWAP on the date of the Conversion Notice (the “Mandatory Prepayment Price”);\n(ii) void its Conversion Notice and retain or have returned, as the case may be, this Note that was to be converted\npursuant to the Conversion Notice (provided that the Holder’s voiding its Conversion Notice shall not affect the Maker’s obligations to make\nany payments which have accrued prior to the date of such notice); or\n(iii) defer issuance of the applicable Conversion Shares until such time as the Maker can legally issue such shares;\nprovided, that the Principal Amount underlying such Conversion Shares shall remain outstanding until the delivery of such Conversion Shares;\nprovided, further, that if the Holder elects to defer the issuance of the Conversion Shares, it may exercise its rights under either clause (i) or (ii)\nabove at any time prior to the issuance of the Conversion Shares upon two (2) Business Days’ notice to the Maker.\n(b) Mechanics of Fulfilling Holder’s Election. The Maker shall immediately send to the Holder, upon receipt of a Conversion\nNotice from the Holder, which cannot be fully satisfied as described in Section 3.6(a) above, a notice of the Maker’s inability to fully satisfy\nthe Conversion Notice (the “Inability to Fully Convert Notice”). Such Inability to Fully Convert Notice shall indicate (i) the reason why the\nMaker is unable to fully satisfy the Holder’s Conversion Notice; and (ii) the amount of this Note which cannot be converted. The Holder shall\nnotify the Maker of its election pursuant to Section 3.6(a) above by delivering written notice to the Maker (“Notice in Response to Inability to\nConvert”).\n(c) Payment of Mandatory Prepayment Price. If the Holder shall elect to have its Note prepaid pursuant to Section 3.6(a)(i)\nabove, the Maker shall pay the Mandatory Prepayment Price to the Holder within five (5) Business Days of the Maker’s receipt of the\nHolder’s Notice in Response to Inability to Convert; provided that prior to the Maker’s receipt of the Holder’s Notice in Response to Inability\nto Convert the Maker has not delivered a notice to the Holder stating, to the satisfaction of the Holder, that the event or condition resulting in\nthe Mandatory Prepayment has been cured and all Conversion Shares issuable to the Holder can and will be delivered to the Holder in\naccordance with the terms of this Note. If the Maker shall fail to pay the applicable Mandatory Prepayment Price to the Holder on the date\nthat is one (1) Business Day following the Maker’s receipt of the Holder’s Notice in Response to Inability to Convert, in addition to any\nremedy the Holder may have under this Note and the Purchase Agreement, such unpaid amount shall bear interest at the rate of two percent\n(2%) per month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full. Until the full Mandatory Prepayment Price is paid in full to the Holder, the\nHolder may (i) void the Mandatory Prepayment with respect to that portion of the Note for which the full Mandatory Prepayment Price has\nnot been paid and (ii) receive back such Note.\n(d) Dividends and Distributions. The Holder shall be entitled to receive, on an as-converted basis, any dividends paid or\ndistributions on Common Stock as if this Note were converted into shares of Common Stock (without regard to limitations on conversion)\nimmediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution, at the Conversion Price.\nARTICLE 4\n4.1 Covenants.

On or before the\nfirst Trading Day following the date on which the Company has received the Exercise Notice, the Company shall transmit by electronic mail an\nacknowledgement of confirmation of receipt of the Exercise Notice. Subject to Section 2.4, this Warrant shall be deemed exercised for all purposes as of\nthe close of business on the day on which the Holder has delivered the Exercise Notice to the Company. The Aggregate Exercise Price, if any, shall be\npaid by wire transfer to the Company within five (5) Business Days of the date of exercise and prior to the time the Company issues the certificates\nevidencing the shares issuable upon such exercise. In the event this Warrant is not exercised in full, the Company may, at its expense, require the Holder,\nafter such partial exercise, to promptly return this Warrant to the Company and the Company will forthwith issue and deliver to or upon the order of the\nHolder a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor, in the name of the Holder or as the Holder (upon payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer\ntaxes) may request, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock equal (without giving effect to any\nadjustment therein) to the number of such shares called for on the face of this Warrant minus the number of such shares (without giving effect to any\nadjustment therein) for which this Warrant shall have been exercised.\n2.2.

If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (a) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes\na distribution or distributions on shares of Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in shares of Common Stock (which,\nfor avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant), (b) subdivides (including\nby way of share split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (c) combines (including by way of reverse stock split)\noutstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (d) issues by reclassification of shares of Common Stock any shares of capital\nstock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of\nCommon Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of\nshares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be\nproportionately adjusted such that the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section\n5.1 shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and\nshall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.\n5.2 Pro Rata Distributions. During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other\ndistribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including,\nwithout limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate\nrearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a “Distribution”), at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such\ncase, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder shall be notified at least ten days prior to the record\ndate for determining shareholders entitled to participate in the Distribution and Holder shall, at its option, exercise its warrants on or prior to such record\ndate be entitled to participate in such Distribution (provided, however, that, to the extent that the Holder’s warrant exercise would result in the Holder\nexceeding the beneficial ownership limitation provided for in Section 10, then the Holder shall not be entitled to exercise its warrants). .\n.\n5.3 Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (a) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related\ntransactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (b) the Company or any Subsidiary, directly or indirectly,\neffects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related\ntransactions, (c) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant\nto which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by\nthe holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50% or more of the voting power of the common equity of the Company, (d) the\nCompany, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock\nor any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property,\nor (e) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business\ncombination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group\nof Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50% or more of the voting power\nof the common equity of the Company (each a “Fundamental Transaction”), then, Holder shall be notified at least ten days prior to the closing of the\ntransaction and Holder shall, at its option, exercise its warrants prior to the closing. In the event that Holder fails to exercise the warrants, the warrants\nwill be terminated upon closing.\n5.4 Adjustments to Exercise Price Upon Issuance of Common Stock. In the event the Company shall at any time or from time to time after\nthe Closing Date (but whether before or after the Issue Date) issue or sell any additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents\n(“Additional Shares of Common Stock”), other than Exempted Securities, at an effective price per share (or issuable, convertible or exercisable at a\nprice per share) that is less than the Exercise Price then in effect or without consideration (a “Dilutive Issuance”), then automatically and without further\naction by any Person the Exercise Price upon each such issuance shall be reduced to a price equal to the consideration per share paid for such Additional\nShares of Common Stock (the “Base Share Price”). For purposes of clarification, the amount of consideration received for such Additional Shares of\nCommon Stock shall not include the value of any additional securities or other rights received in connection with such issuance of Additional Shares of\nCommon Stock (i.e., warrants, rights of first refusal or other similar rights). The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing, no later than the Trading\nDay following the issuance or deemed issuance of any Additional Shares of Common Stock subject to this Section 5.4, indicating therein the applicable\nissuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the “Dilutive Issuance Notice”). For\npurposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5.4, upon the occurrence of any\nDilutive Issuance, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder\naccurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise. If the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction, the Company shall be\ndeemed to have issued Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at the lowest possible price, conversion price or exercise price at which such\nsecurities may be issued, converted or exercised.\n5.5 Calculations. All calculations under this Section 5 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.\nFor purposes of this Section 5, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the\nnumber of shares of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding at the close of the Trading Day on or, if not applicable,\nmost recently preceding, such given date.\n5.6 Notice to Holder.\n( a ) Adjustment to Exercise Price or number of Warrant Shares. Whenever the Exercise Price or number of Warrant Shares is\nadjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 5, the Company shall promptly mail to the Holder a notice setting forth the Exercise Price or number of\nWarrant Shares, as applicable, after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.\n(b) Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder. If (i) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever form) on\nthe Common Stock; (ii) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock; (iii) the Company\nshall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or\nof any rights; (iv) the approval of any stockholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Common Stock, any\nconsolidation or merger to which the Company is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, of any compulsory\nshare exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property; or (v) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or\ninvoluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company; then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be mailed to the Holder\nat its last address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable record or\neffective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution,\nredemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to such\ndividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,\ntransfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record\nshall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification,\nconsolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall\nnot affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. Subject to applicable law, the Holder is entitled to exercise this\nWarrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice.

(“Skypersonic”), Teal Drones, Inc. (“Teal”), and Red Cat Propware, Inc. (“Propware”), as well as Rotor Riot LLC (“Rotor Riot”), Fat Shark Holdings, Ltd. (“Fat Shark”), which were wholly owned subsidiaries until February 16, 2024.\n\n3   \n---  \n  \n**PART I**\n\n**ITEM 1. BUSINESS**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Company was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado in 1984 under the name Oravest International, Inc. In November 2016, we changed our name to TimefireVR, Inc. and re-incorporated in Nevada. In May 2019, the Company completed a share exchange agreement with Propware which resulted in the Propware shareholders acquiring an 83% ownership interest, and management control, of the Company. In connection with the share exchange agreement, we changed our name to Red Cat Holdings, Inc. (“Red Cat” or the “Company” or “we”) and our operating focus to the drone industry.\n\nPrior to the share exchange agreement, Propware was focused on the research and development of software solutions that could provide secure cloud-based analytics, storage and services for the drone industry. Following the share exchange agreement and its name change, Red Cat has completed a series of acquisitions and financings which have broadened the scope of its activities in the drone industry. These acquisitions included:\n\n | In January 2020, we acquired Rotor Riot, a reseller of drones and related parts, primarily to the consumer marketplace through its digital storefront located at www.rotorriot.com. The total purchase price was $2.0 million.  \n---|---  \n | In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark which sells consumer electronics products to the first-person view (“FPV”) sector of the drone industry. Fat Shark’s flagship products are headsets with a built-in display (or “goggles”) that allow a pilot to see a real-time video feed from a camera typically mounted on an aerial platform or drone. The total purchase price was $8.4 million.  \n---|---  \n | In May 2021, we acquired Skypersonic, a provider of drone products and software solutions that enable drone inspection flights that can be executed by pilots anywhere in the world. Skypersonic powers drones to “Fly Anywhere” and “Inspect the Impossible”. Its patented software and hardware solutions allow for inspection services in restricted spaces where GPS is denied or unavailable. The total purchase price was $2.8 million.  \n---|---  \n | In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal, a leader in providing sophisticated and complex unmanned aerial vehicle (\"UAV\") technology, primarily drones, to government and commercial enterprises, most notably, the military. Teal manufactures drones approved by the U.S. Department of Defense for reconnaissance, public safety, and inspection applications. The total purchase price was $10.0 million.  \n---|---  \n  \nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment and the Consumer segment to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. The Enterprise segment’s initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, the segment narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\n\nThe Enterprise segment’s current business strategy is focused on providing integrated robotic hardware and software for use across a variety of applications. Its solutions provide critical situational awareness and actionable intelligence to on-the-ground warfighters and battlefield commanders as well as firefighters and public safety officials. Our Enterprise segment’s efforts are centered on developing and scaling an American made family of systems. We have since completed construction of a manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City and believe that an increased focus by the United States government and American businesses on purchasing products that are “Made in America” provide our Enterprise segment with a competitive advantage.\n\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines, Inc. (or “Unusual Machines” or “UMAC”). The sale reflects our decision to focus our efforts and capital on defense where we believe there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value.\n\n4   \n---  \n  \n**_Key Business Accomplishments during Fiscal 2024 and to date include:_**\n\n**Scaling Teal 2, a military-grade sUAS Designed to “Dominate the Night™”**\n\nFollowing its acquisition by Red Cat in August 2021, Teal accelerated efforts on the development of its next generation drone for our Enterprise segment. These efforts culminated in the launch of the Teal 2 in April 2023. The Teal 2 is the first small, unmanned aircraft system (“sUAS”) designed to “Dominate the Night”, when most combat operations take place, through its enhanced capabilities. The Teal 2 offers the latest intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (“ISR”) technology and delivers time-critical information that enables the warfighter to make faster and smarter decisions.\n\nThe Teal 2 is manufactured exclusively at Teal’s purpose-built factory in Salt Lake City, Utah. Teal originally moved into the facility in October 2021. In January 2022, Teal doubled the size of the facility, which now totals approximately 22,000 square feet, to fully scale production capacity to meet the forecast growth in demand and to house its expanding team of software and technology engineers. We believe that maximum production capacity for this facility can reach 5,000 or more drones per month over the next few years, provided that additional capital investments are made and manufacturing efficiencies realized. Manufacturing in the United States, “Made in the USA,” is a critical consideration of the U.S. government and other state and local government agencies.\n\nDuring Fiscal 2024, Teal continued to scale the manufacturing facility, including dedicated teams for production and assembly, manufacturing engineering, supply chain and logistics, warranty and returns, as well as a flight operations team that is focused on manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control.\n\n**Designation of Teal 2 as Blue UAS received from U.S. Department of Defense**\n\nIn June 2023, the Teal 2 received clearance from the U.S. Department of Defense (\"DoD\") to be designated as a Blue UAS. The DoD defines these drones as NDAA (National Defense Authorization Act) compliant, validated as cyber secure, and safe to fly. This designation enables Teal to fill orders from federal, state, and local government agencies subject to oversight by the DoD, including those orders that were contingent upon receiving certification. In addition, many governments of allied nations are more likely to purchase Blue UAS approved drones. Teal's legacy drone, the Golden Eagle, is also on the cleared list.\n\nAfter the U.S. Army banned its forces from using Chinese-made quadcopters due to security risks (the radio controls of the drone are unencrypted and the devices could potentially capture, store and upload sensitive information to the Chinese government), the DoD began developing its own alternatives under a defense program known as Blue sUAS. Blue sUAS is an initiative of the Defense Innovation Unit (“DIU”), the only DoD organization focused on accelerating the adoption of commercial and dual use technology to solve operational challenges at a speed and scale that is faster and higher than normal for government agencies.\n\n**Red Cat Futures Initiative**\n\nIn May 2024, we announced the formation of the Red Cat Futures Initiative (RFI). RFI is an independent, industry-wide consortium of robotics and autonomous systems (RAS) partners dedicated to putting the most advanced and interoperable uncrewed aircraft systems into the hands of warfighters. Anchored by Red Cat’s Teal Drones, the RFI unites the world’s most innovative UAS hardware and software companies focused on AI/ML, swarming, FPV, command and control, and payloads.\n\nFounding members include Ocean Power Technologies (NYSE: OPTT), Sentien Robotics, Primordial Labs, Athena AI, Unusual Machines, Reach Power, Doodle Labs, and MMS Products. The shared goal is advocacy, integrations and co-marketing that bridges considerable technology gaps through modular open architecture.\n\n5   \n---  \n  \n**_Government Contracts and Orders_**\n\nThe Enterprise segment is focused on U.S. federal government agencies, particularly the DoD, as its initial target market. Its longer term target customer base includes U.S. state and local government agencies, as well as governments of foreign allies. An overview of existing government contracts and recent developments include:\n\n**Finalist for Short Range Reconnaissance Program of Record**\n\nIn March 2022, Teal was selected by the DoD’s DIU and the U.S. Army to compete in the Short Range Reconnaissance Tranche 2 (SRR T2) Program of Record. The rigorous technical requirements and program objectives of SRR T2 dramatically narrowed the field from 37 drone manufacturers down to two vendors. The Army has indicated that Tranche 2 and 3 have been combined and will represent the final tranche of the SRR program.\n\nTeal was selected to develop a next-generation sUAS designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) duties, with a focus on autonomous capability, for the U.S. Army. The ultimate goal of the SRR T2 program is to provide a small, rucksack portable, fully encrypted sUAS that provides all Army infantry platoons (consisting of 20-50 soldiers) with situational awareness beyond the next terrain.\n\nAs of May 2024, Teal has completed all milestones in its SRR T2 contract, whose value totaled $5.7 million. Teal expects the Army to announce vendor selection of a production award by the fourth quarter of calendar 2024.\n\n**U.S. Border Patrol**\n\n**$1.8 Million Purchase Order from U.S. Border Patrol**\n\nIn September 2023, Teal was awarded a $1.8 million contract from U.S. Customs and Border Protection to provide Teal 2 systems to U.S. Border Patrol. The U.S. Border Patrol is using the Teal 2 to provide supplemental airborne reconnaissance, surveillance and tracking capability, enhancing situational awareness for U.S. field commanders and agents.\n\n**Customs and Border Protection Contract Worth up to $90 Million over Five Years**\n\nIn December 2021, Teal was one of only five contractors designated to participate in a firm, fixed price, multiple award blanket purchase agreement (BPA) by the United States Customs and Border Protection. The BPA has an estimated value of $90 million in total over a 5-year period.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security agencies can place orders through the BPA for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). The drones will provide supplemental airborne reconnaissance, surveillance, and tracking capability to enhance situational awareness for field commanders and agents in areas that lack nearby traditional surveillance systems or available manned air support.\n\n**U.S. Defense Logistics Agency**\n\nIn August 2023, Teal received two purchase orders totaling $5.2 million from the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Both orders were requested by U.S. Air Force Security Forces, whose role is to defend Air Force bases and installations.\n\nThe procurements were sourced by global operations support company Noble Supply & Logistics, LLC (NOBLE) as part of the DLA’s Special Operational Equipment Tailored Logistics Support (“SOE TLS Program”). NOBLE is a DLA-designated provider for the SOE TLS Program. This 10-year program, capped at $33 billion, covers the delivery of logistics support to federal agencies, military bases and other DLA customers worldwide, helping them meet their special operational equipment requirements. \n\n6   \n---  \n  \n**NATO Allied Countries**\n\nIn March 2024, Teal received $2.5 million in new contract awards with two NATO allied countries. As part of our expanded global sales strategy, the contract delivery featured Teal 2 drone systems, training, and accessories.\n\n**_Product Development_**\n\nProduct development efforts in fiscal 2024 were focused on the scaling of the Teal 2 which was officially launched in April 2023 at the Army Aviation Mission Solutions Summit. Significant resources were also expended developing the next generation system under the Army's SRR Tranche 2 program.\n\n**_Sales and Marketing_**\n\nSince acquiring Teal in August 2021, we have built a sales and marketing team which presently consists of 16 direct and support professionals. Most of their efforts in fiscal 2024 were focused on developing relationships with the military agencies of the U.S. Federal Government. While the sales cycle for government agencies can be extensive and take considerable time and effort to establish, they can often become a long-term buyer once initial sales are closed.\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, we continued global expansion efforts among U.S. allies. In December 2023, the team showcased the Teal 2 drone at Expodefensa 2023 in Latin America. Expodefensa 2023 is a main hub for security and defense in Latin America, allowing international exhibitors to present their systems and products in response to a growing regional demand. The aim of the event was to help governments and armed forces face their operational and capability challenges while playing a role in building a safer Latin America.\n\nIn February 2024, the team showcased the Teal 2 drone at the World Defense Show in Saudi Arabia. The World Defense Show provided a unique platform for the world’s defense industry to network, partner, share knowledge, and discover new innovations and capabilities across all defense domains. The World Defense Show attracted key defense figures, government officials, decision-makers, and thought leaders across all levels of the supply chain.\n\n**_Other Teal Information_**\n\n**Suppliers**\n\nTeal purchases inventory from over 35 suppliers. Approximately 80% of this inventory is purchased from four vendors. The most critical components are electronics and cameras. Teal's supply chain is NDAA and Blue UAS compliant. All suppliers are approved based on Teal's strict vendor qualification process.\n\n**Competition**\n\nTeal's primary competitor is Shenzhen Da-Jiang Innovations Sciences and Technologies Company Limited (“DJI”), headquartered in Shenzhen, China. Though regulation is trending toward further restrictions against Chinese made drones, DJI remains a global industry leader and continues to serve markets on which Teal is focused. Teal’s primary domestic competitor is Skydio Inc. This company was selected alongside Teal out of 37 companies to compete in the Short Range Reconnaissance Tranche 2 program. Future competitors may include established defense contractors that are better capitalized and resourced to compete in Teal's markets. Teal competes with a combination of its unique product value propositions (i.e., nighttime capability, modular platform), and scalable, low-cost, domestic manufacturing.\n\n**The Drone Industry**\n\nThe drone industry continues to expand to become a powerful business tool and recreational activity, with growth occurring broadly and across our targeted industries. According to Drone Industry Insights, the global drone market is expected to grow to $54.6 billion by 2030, with the commercial market growing at a 7.7% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). According to Vantage Market Research, the global military drone market is projected to reach a value of $34.9 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 11.6%.\n\n7   \n---  \n  \n**Government Regulation and Federal Policy**\n\n**The Federal Aviation Administration**\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) of the United States Department of Transportation is responsible for the regulation and oversight of civil aviation within the U.S. Its primary mission is to ensure the safety of civil aviation. The FAA has adopted the name “unmanned aircraft systems” (“UAS”) to describe aircraft systems without a flight crew on board. More common names include drone, UAV and remotely operated aircraft.\n\nThe FAA began issuing conditional approvals allowing the operation of drones as early 2005 with their scope and frequency expanding in recent years with the significant increase in the number of drones sold. In December 2015, the FAA announced that all drones weighing more than 250 grams, or 0.55 pounds, must be registered with the FAA. In June 2016, the FAA released a new section under title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Part 107) defining a regulatory framework for the commercial, industrial and public safety use of drones, establishing a licensing program for drone pilots, and issuing Remote Pilot certificates to qualified pilots. As of July 2023, the FAA reported the registration of almost 870,000 drones, of which approximately 350,000 were commercial and approximately 520,000 were recreational. In addition, more than 330,000 remote pilots were certified. This data strongly suggests drones represent the largest share of commercial aviation in the United States by number of pilots, aircraft, and flights.\n\nIn January 2021, the FAA finalized rules requiring that drones be identifiable remotely. These rules became effective for drone manufacturers in September 2022 and for drone pilots in September 2023. The FAA believes that remote ID technologies enhance safety and security by allowing the FAA, law enforcement, and federal security agencies to identify drones flying in their jurisdiction. These efforts lay the foundation for more complex operations, such as those beyond visual line of sight at low altitudes, as the FAA and the drone industry move toward a unified air traffic management ecosystem as drone operations become a routine fixture in the National Airspace System (the “NAS”).\n\nIn May of 2023, the FAA began soliciting recommendations from the industry regarding rule making supporting the implementation of Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) operations. This rulemaking would support standard implementation of routine flights over the horizon, and potentially multiple miles from a drone’s control station and pilot. This rulemaking would free drone pilots and operators from restrictive and labor-intensive conditional approval petitions, and would improve the economies of scale for drones to tackle larger mission sets, such as surveying miles of power lines or railroad tracks, or securing miles of rural border.\n\nIn July 2023, the FAA released a notice of proposed rulemaking for another regulation that would ease the integration of UAS into the NAS. This rule, known as Modernization of Special Purpose Airworthiness Certificates, seeks to modernize the manner in which the FAA performs safety assessment of the design of certain aircraft, including UAS. As a result, the testing and evaluation burden on manufacturers is greatly decreased, and the cost of development of UAS may be dramatically reduced. \n\n**American Security Drone Act**\n\nIn February 2023, two Congressman introduced the American Security Drone Act (ASDA) which would prohibit the purchase and operation of drones from countries identified as national security threats such as China. The basis for the legislation is that purchases from these countries (i) pose a significant threat to national security, (ii) represent efforts to infiltrate and influence American society, and (iii) risk the theft of personal and business data. Specifically, the American Security Drone Act:\n\n | Prohibits federal departments and agencies from procuring certain foreign commercial off-the-shelf drone or covered unmanned aircraft system manufactured or assembled in countries identified as national security threats and provides a timeline to end current use of these drones.  \n---|---  \n | Prohibits the use of federal funds awarded through certain contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements to state or local governments from being used to purchase foreign commercial off-the-shelf drones or covered unmanned aircraft systems manufactured or assembled in a country identified as a national security threat.  \n---|---  \n | Requires the Comptroller General of the United States to submit a report to Congress detailing the amount of foreign commercial off-the-shelf drones and covered unmanned aircraft systems procured by federal departments and agencies from countries identified as national security threats.  \n---|---  \n  \nIn December 2023, the ASDA was officially passed into law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\n8   \n---  \n  \n**Other Corporate Information**\n\n**_Environmental Considerations_**\n\nWhile the operations of many businesses have some form of negative impact on the environment, drones have a unique ability to provide a positive contribution. Many of these relate to a drone’s ability to reach places in a more efficient manner, and include such activities as:\n\n | Aerial mapping and nature monitoring  \n---|---  \n | Maintenance of renewable energy sources and infrastructure  \n---|---  \n | Disaster relief monitoring  \n---|---  \n | Agriculture sustainability  \n---|---  \n | Wildlife conservation  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Intellectual Property_**\n\nThe Company has consolidated its intellectual property (“IP”) into a subsidiary, UAVPatent Corp. The subsidiary holds 22 issued patents and registered designs and 8 pending patents and registered designs. The IP portfolio includes design and utility patents ranging from modular architectures to autonomous capabilities. None of the patents are currently licensed and IP is generated in the general course of engineering design.\n\nUAVPatent Corp also has the trademarks on the Teal, Skypersonic, and Red Cat brands and logos.\n\n**_Employees_**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had 89 full-time employees.\n\n**_Research and Development_**\n\nDuring the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred research and development costs of $5,500,932 and $4,902,334, respectively, excluding $395,105 and $692,947 of stock-based compensation, respectively. \n\n9   \n---  \n  \n**Item 1A.

to possible litigation.  \n---|---  \n | We must recruit and retain highly trained and experienced employees, especially engineers, in order to succeed in our business.  \n---|---  \n | Our facilities and information systems and those of our key suppliers could be damaged as a result of disasters or unpredictable events which could have an adverse effect on our business operations.  \n---|---  \n | We rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide components for our products which may lead to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain, increase our costs, and adversely impact our operating results.  \n---|---  \n | Several steps of our manufacturing processes are dependent upon certain critical machines and tools which could result in delivery interruptions and foregone revenues.  \n---|---  \n | We depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components for use in our products.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks Related to our Industry_**\n\n | We operate in an emerging and rapidly growing industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects.  \n---|---  \n | We face competition from larger companies that have substantially greater resources which challenges our ability to establish market share, grow our business segments, and reach profitability.  \n---|---  \n | We may not be able to keep pace with technological advances in the drone industry.  \n---|---  \n | Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks Related to Our Enterprise Segment_**\n\n | U.S. government contracts are generally not fully funded at inception and may include provisions that are not favorable to us which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations.  \n---|---  \n | A decline in U.S. government budgets, changes in spending priorities, or delays in contract awards could adversely affect the revenues of our Teal subsidiary.  \n---|---  \n | Our work for the U.S. government could expose us to security risks.  \n---|---  \n | We are subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties that may adversely impact our ability to operate our business.  \n---|---  \n  \n11   \n---  \n  \n**_Risks Related to Our Common Stock_**\n\n | Our management has voting control of the Company.  \n---|---  \n | Our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse impact on the Company.  \n---|---  \n | We have never paid dividends and we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  \n---|---  \n | The listing of our securities on Nasdaq subject us to additional regulations and compliance requirements.  \n---|---  \n | Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue shares of new classes of stock that could adversely affect current holders of our common stock.  \n---|---  \n | Our shares will be subordinate to all of our debts and liabilities which increases the risk that investors could lose their entire investment.  \n---|---  \n | The market price of our shares of common stock is subject to fluctuation.  \n---|---  \n | Future capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership and adversely impact the fair value of their investment.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks Related to Regulatory Matters_**\n\n | The drone industry is subject to various laws and government regulations which could complicate and delay our ability to introduce products, maintain compliance, and avoid violations which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  \n---|---  \n | Our business and products are subject to government regulation, and we may incur additional compliance costs or be forced to suspend or cease operations if we fail to comply.  \n---|---  \n | Our results of operations may suffer if we are not able to successfully manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risks.  \n---|---  \n | Our international operations, including the use of foreign contract manufacturers, subjects us to international operational, financial, legal, political and public health risks which could harm our operating results.  \n---|---  \n | We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate.  \n---|---  \n | We are subject to governmental export and import controls, and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets.  \n---|---  \n  \n12   \n---  \n  \n | Changes in trade policy in the United States and other countries may have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  \n---|---  \n | We may collect, store, process and use the personal information of our customers which subjects us to governmental regulation related to privacy, information security and data protection. Any cybersecurity breaches or our failure to comply with such legal obligations by us, or by our third-party service providers or partners, could harm our business.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Risks Related to Intellectual Property_**\n\n | Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.  \n---|---  \n | Our intellectual property rights and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products.  \n---|---  \n  \n**Risks Related to our Financial Results and Condition**\n\n**_We have incurred net losses since inception._**\n\nWe have never been profitable and reported an accumulated deficit of approximately $81,100,000 at April 30, 2024. These losses have had an adverse effect on our financial condition, stockholders’ equity and working capital. We will need to generate higher revenues, improve profit margins, and control operating costs in order to attain profitability. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to reach profitability.\n\n**_We may need additional capital to fund our expanding operations until we reach profitability, and if we are not able to obtain sufficient capital, we may be forced to limit or curtail our operations._**\n\nIf additional equity and/or debt financing is not available, then we may not be able to continue to develop our business activities, and we will have to modify our business plan. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results and our financial condition. If we are unable to raise additional funds, we could be forced to cease our business activities and dissolve. In such an event, we may incur additional financial obligations, including the accelerated maturity of debt obligations, lease termination fees, employee severance payments, and other creditor and dissolution-related obligations.\n\nOur ability to raise financing through sales of equity and/or debt securities depends on general market conditions and the demand for our common stock and/or debt securities. We may be unable to raise adequate capital through sales of equity and/or debt securities, and if our stock has a low market price at the time of such sales, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. If adequate financing is not available or unavailable on acceptable terms, we may find we are unable to fund expansion, continue offering products and services, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or products, or to respond to competitive pressures in the industry which may jeopardize our ability to continue operations.\n\n**_Lack of long-term purchase orders and commitments from customers may lead to a rapid decline in sales._**\n\nOur customers issue purchase orders solely at their own discretion. Customers are generally able to cancel orders (without penalty) or delay the delivery of products on relatively short notice. In addition, current customers may decide not to purchase products for any reason. If our customers do not continue to purchase our products, then our sales volume could decline rapidly with little or no warning.\n\n13   \n---  \n  \nWe cannot rely on long-term purchase orders or commitments to protect us from the negative financial effects of a decline in demand for our products. The uncertainty of product orders makes it difficult to forecast sales and allocate resources in a manner consistent with actual sales. Moreover, expense levels and the amounts invested in capital equipment and new product development costs are based in part on expectations of future sales and, if expectations regarding future sales are inaccurate, we may be unable to reduce costs in a timely manner to adjust for sales shortfalls. As a result of lack of long-term purchase orders and purchase commitments, we may experience a rapid decline in sales.\n\n**_Our products require a continuing investment in research and development, and may experience technical problems or delays, which could lead the business to fail._**\n\nOur research and development efforts remain subject to all the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging and innovative technologies. This includes, for example, unexpected technical problems or the possible insufficiency of funds for completing development of these products. If technical problems or delays arise, further improvements in products and the introduction of future products could be adversely impacted, and we could incur significant additional expenses, an inability to increase revenues and increasing operating losses.\n\n**_The nature of our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by insurance or indemnity._**\n\nWe develop and sell products where insurance or indemnification may not be available, including (i) those using advanced and unproven technologies and drones, and (ii) those that collect, distribute and analyze various types of information.\n\nFailure of certain of our products could result in loss of life or property damage. Certain products may raise questions with respect to issues of civil liberties, intellectual property, trespass, conversion and similar concepts. Indemnification to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from a failure of technologies developed or deployed may be available in certain circumstances but not in others. We do not and are not able to maintain insurance to protect against our risks and uncertainties. Substantial claims resulting from an accident, failure of our product, or liability arising from our products in excess of any indemnity or insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or was not obtained) could harm our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results. Any accident, even if fully covered or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively.\n\n**_Product quality issues and a higher-than-expected number of warranty claims or returns could harm our business and operating results._**\n\nThe products that we sell could contain defects in design or manufacture. Defects could also occur in the products or components that are supplied to us. There can be no assurance we will be able to detect and remedy all defects in the hardware and software we sell which could result in product recalls, product redesign efforts, loss of revenue, reputational damage and significant warranty and other remediation expenses. If we determine that a product does not meet product quality standards or may contain a defect, the launch of such product could be delayed until we remedy the quality issue or defect. The costs associated with any protracted delay necessary to remedy a quality issue or defect in a new product could be substantial.\n\nWe generally provide a one-year warranty on all of our products. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could expose us to liability for damages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, and we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems. In addition, if any of our product designs are defective or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall campaign. In part due to the terms of our warranty policy, any failure rate of our products that exceeds our expectations may result in unanticipated losses. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality of our products could affect our brand image and decrease retailer, distributor and consumer confidence and demand, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, accidental damage coverage and extended warranties are regulated in the United States at the state level and are treated differently within each state. Additionally, outside of the United States, regulations for extended warranties and accidental damage vary from country to country. Changes in interpretation of the regulations concerning extended warranties and accidental damage coverage on a federal, state, local or international level may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to continue to offer our support services. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition.\n\n14   \n---  \n  \n**_Our products may experience declining unit prices and we may not be able to offset that decline with production cost decreases or higher unit sales._**\n\nPrices of established enterprise electronics, displays, personal computers, and mobile products tend to decline significantly over time or as new enhanced versions are introduced, frequently every 12 to 24 months in the markets in which we compete. In order to maintain adequate product profit margins over the long term, we believe that we will need to continuously develop product enhancements and new technologies that will either slow price declines of our products or reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products. While we anticipate opportunities to reduce production costs over time, we may not be able to reduce our component costs. We expect to attempt to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling price by introducing new products, increasing our sales volumes, or adjusting our product mix. If we fail to do so, our results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\n\n**_Our operating results may be adversely impacted by worldwide political, economic and public health uncertainties and specific conditions in the markets we address._**\n\nA deterioration in global economic, financial, and/or public health conditions, including global pandemics, economic recessions and political turmoil could materially adversely affect (i) our ability to raise, or the terms of needed capital; (ii) demand for our current and future products; and (iii) the supply of components for our products. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery, worldwide, or in the drone industry.\n\n**_Acquisitions could divert the attention of key personnel, be difficult to integrate, dilute our existing shareholders and adversely impact our financial results._**\n\nSince January 2020, we have completed four acquisitions which have significantly increased the scope of our operations and our employee headcount. Acquisitions include a wide range of risks, any of which could hurt our business, including the following:\n\n | difficulties in integrating the operations of a newly acquired company including existing products and contracts, differences in corporate culture, operating systems and other integration issues;  \n---|---  \n | challenges supporting and transitioning the customers of acquired companies and the loss of any acquired customers will adversely impact our revenues and operating results;  \n---|---  \n | assumption of known and unknown operating problems and our potential inability to address them in a timely and efficient manner;  \n---|---  \n | risks of entering new geographic markets where we have no prior experience and are required to gain an understanding of the legal, regulatory, labor and business laws of these new markets;  \n---|---  \n  \nIn addition, there are many financial risks associated with the cost of acquisitions. If we finance the cost of an acquisition using common stock, then our existing shareholders will be diluted and our stock price could decrease. If we finance the cost of an acquisition using debt, such financing could include restrictive covenants that restrict our operating and financial flexibility. If the stock market perceives that we overpaid for the acquisition, then our stock price could decrease.\n\n**_Our failure to effectively manage growth could harm our business._**\n\nWe intend to expand the number and types of products we sell. We will need to replace and regularly introduce on a timely basis new products and technologies, enhance existing products, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded or enhanced versions of our existing products.\n\n15   \n---  \n  \nThe replacement and expansion of our products places a significant strain on our management, operations and engineering resources. Specifically, the areas that are strained most by these activities include the following:\n\n | **New Product Launches:** With the changes in and growth of our product portfolio, we will experience increased complexity in coordinating product development, manufacturing, and shipping. As this complexity increases, it places a strain on our ability to accurately coordinate the commercial launch of our products with adequate supply to meet anticipated customer demand and effectively market to stimulate demand and market acceptance. We have experienced delays in the past. If we are unable to scale and improve our product launch coordination, we could frustrate our customers and lose possible retail shelf space and product sales;  \n---|---  \n | **Existing Products Impacted by New Introductions :** The introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products, or replace sales of some of our current products, thereby offsetting the benefit of a successful product introduction and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products. These occurrences could potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. We may also provide price protection to some of our retailers as a result of new product introductions and reduce the prices of existing products. If we fail to effectively manage new product introductions, our revenue and profitability may be harmed; and  \n---|---  \n | **Forecasting, Planning and Supply Chain Logistics : **With the changes in and growth of our product portfolio, we will experience increased complexity in forecasting customer demand, in planning for production, and in transportation and logistics management. If we are unable to scale and improve our forecasting, planning, production, and logistics management, we could frustrate our customers, lose product sales or accumulate excess inventory.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_Our products are subject to lengthy development cycles._**\n\nOur products are subject to lengthy product development cycles. The time elapsed between initial sampling of our products, the custom design of our products to meet specific product requirements, and the ultimate incorporation of our products into salable products is significant, often with a duration of more than one year. If our products fail to meet our customers’ cost, performance, or technical requirements or if unexpected technical challenges arise in the integration of our products into enterprise markets, then our operating results could be significantly and adversely affected. Long delays in achieving customer qualification and incorporation of our products also could adversely affect our business. Many head-mounted display companies are introducing digital head-mounted displays which could create shortages of components and provide an opportunity for companies with significantly greater resources than us to accelerate migration to digital products in a manner or timeline which we cannot meet, which could cause us to lose market share and harm our business and prospects. These same risks exist in our Enterprise sector where our competitors include some of the largest defense companies in the world.\n\n**_We expect to incur substantial research and development costs related to identifying and commercializing new products and services which may never result in revenues._**\n\nOur future growth depends on expanding into new markets, adapting existing products to new applications, and introducing new products and services that achieve market acceptance. We plan to incur substantial research and development costs as part of these efforts. We spent $5,896,037 million, or 33% of our revenue, in our fiscal year ended April 30, 2024, on internal research and development activities. We believe that there are significant investment opportunities in a number of business areas. Because we account for internal research and development as an operating expense, these expenditures will adversely affect our earnings in the future. Further, our research and development programs may not produce successful results, and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance, generate revenue or cash flow, which could adversely impact our financial results and liquidity.\n\n16   \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to our Operations**\n\n**_Our operations may be adversely affected if we lose our rights under third-party technology licenses._**\n\nOur business relies on technology rights and software licensed from third parties. We could lose our exclusivity or other rights to use the technology if we fail to comply with the terms and performance requirements of the licenses. In addition, certain licensors may terminate a license upon our breach and have the right to consent to sublicense arrangements. If we were to lose our rights under any of these licenses, or if we were unable to obtain required consents to future sublicenses, we could lose a competitive advantage in the market, and may even lose the ability to commercialize certain products or technologies.\n\n**_If our customers are not satisfied with our technical support, firmware or software updates, they may choose not to purchase our products which would adversely impact business and operating results._**\n\nOur business relies on our customers’ satisfaction with the technical support, firmware, software and security updates we provide to support our products. If we fail to provide technical support services and necessary updates that are (i) responsive, (ii) satisfy our customers’ expectations and (iii) resolve issues that they encounter with our products, then customers may choose not to purchase additional products and we may face brand and reputational harm which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\n**_Our use of open-source software could negatively affect our ability to sell our products and could subject us to possible litigation._**\n\nWe incorporate open-source software into our products. Open-source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open-source licenses. Some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open-source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open-source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open-source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our licensed software. If an author or other third-party that distributes open-source software that we use or license were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of the applicable license, we could incur significant legal expenses defending against those allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from offering or selling our products that contained the open-source software and be required to comply with the foregoing conditions. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business and financial condition. \n\n**_We must recruit and retain highly trained and experienced employees, especially engineers, in order to succeed in our business._**\n\nWe will need to hire and retain highly skilled technical personnel as employees and as independent contractors in order to develop our products and grow our business. The competition for highly skilled technical, managerial, and other personnel can be intense. Our recruiting and retention success is substantially dependent upon our ability to offer competitive salaries and benefits to our employees. We must compete with companies that possess greater financial and other resources than we do and that may be more attractive to potential employees and contractors. To be competitive, we may have to increase the compensation, bonuses, stock options and other fringe benefits we offer to employees in order to attract and retain such personnel. The costs of retaining or attracting new personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we fail to attract and retain the technical and managerial personnel required to be successful, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n**_Our facilities and information systems and those of our key suppliers could be damaged as a result of disasters or unpredictable events which could have an adverse effect on our business operations._**\n\nOur manufacturing facility is located in Salt Lake City, Utah. We also rely on third-party manufacturing plants in the US, Asia and other parts of the world to provide key components for our products and services. If major disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tropical storms pandemics, fires, floods, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, transportation disasters or other events occur in any of these locations, or the effect of climate change on any of these factors or our locations, or our information systems or communications network or those of any of our key component suppliers breaks down or operates improperly as a result of such events, our facilities or those of our key suppliers may be seriously damaged, and we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. We may also incur expenses relating to such damages. If production or shipment of our products or components is stopped or delayed or if we incur any increased expenses as a result of damage to our facilities, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n17   \n---  \n  \n**_We rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide components for our products which may lead to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain, increase our costs, and adversely impact our operating results_**\n\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into our products are sourced from third-party suppliers. Some of the key components used to manufacture our products come from a limited or single source of supply or by a supplier that could potentially become a competitor. Our contract manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf from approved suppliers. We are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules. We have experienced component shortages and the availability of these components may be unpredictable in the future.\n\nIf we lose access to or experience a significant disruption in the supply of products and components from a supplier, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand for our products, our suppliers might not have the capacity or elect not to meet our needs as they allocate components to other customers. Developing suitable alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may adversely affect our ability to fulfill our orders in a timely or cost-effective manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with the supplier’s quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, labor and other ethical practices. If we seek to source materials from new suppliers, there can be no assurance that we could do so in a manner that does not disrupt the manufacture and sale of our products.\n\nOur reliance on single source, or a small number of suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to supplier capacity constraints, price increases, timely delivery, component quality, failure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions, as well as natural disasters, fire, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, including global pandemics.\n\n**_Several steps of our manufacturing processes are dependent upon certain critical machines and tools which could result in delivery interruptions and foregone revenues._**\n\nWe currently have little equipment redundancy in manufacturing locales. If we experience any significant disruption in manufacturing or a serious failure of a critical piece of equipment, we may be unable to supply products to our customers in a timely manner. Interruptions in our manufacturing could be caused by equipment problems, the introduction of new equipment into the manufacturing process or delays in the delivery of new manufacturing equipment. Lead-time for delivery, installation, testing, repair and maintenance of manufacturing equipment can be extensive. We have experienced production interruptions in the past and no assurance can be given that we will not lose potential sales or be able to meet production orders due to future production interruptions in our manufacturing lines.\n\n**_We depend on third parties to provide integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components for use in our products._**\n\nWe do not manufacture the integrated circuit chip sets, optics, micro-displays, backlights, projection engines, printed circuit boards or other electronic components which are used in our products. Instead, we purchase them from third-party suppliers or rely on third-party independent contractors for these integrated circuit chip sets and other critical components, some of which are customized, or custom made for us. We also may use third parties to assemble all or portions of our products. Some of these third-party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. If any of these third-party contractors or suppliers were unable or unwilling to supply these components, our sales and operating results would be adversely impacted. As the availability of components decreases, the cost of acquiring those components ordinarily increases. High growth product categories have experienced chronic shortages of components during periods of exceptionally high demand. If we do not properly anticipate the need for or procure critical components, we may pay higher prices for those components, our gross profits may decrease and we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers and end-users which could reduce our competitiveness, cause a decline in our market share and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\n18   \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to our Industry**\n\n**_We operate in an emerging and rapidly growing industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects._**\n\nThe drone industry is relatively new and is growing rapidly. As a result, it is difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. We cannot accurately predict whether, and even when, demand for our products will increase, if at all. The risks, uncertainties and challenges encountered by companies operating in emerging and rapidly growing industries include:\n\n | Generating sufficient revenue to cover operating costs and sustain operations;  \n---|---  \n | Acquiring and maintaining market share;  \n---|---  \n | Attracting and retaining qualified personnel, especially engineers with the requisite technical skills;  \n---|---  \n | Successfully developing and commercially marketing new products:  \n---|---  \n | Accessing the capital markets to raise additional capital, on reasonable terms, if and when required to sustain operations or to grow the business.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_We face competition from larger companies that have substantially greater resources which challenges our ability to establish market share, grow our business segments, and reach profitability._**\n\nThe drone industry is attracting a wide range of significantly larger companies which have substantially greater financial, management, research and marketing resources than us. Competitors in the Enterprise segment include transportation companies like United Parcel Service, Federal Express and Amazon, as well as defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and AeroVironment. Our competitors may be able to provide customers with different or greater capabilities than we can provide, including technical qualifications, pricing, and key technical support. Many of our competitors may utilize their greater resources to (i) develop competing products and technologies, (ii) leverage their financial strength to utilize economies of scale and offer lower pricing, and (iii) hire more qualified personnel by offering more generous compensation packages. In order to secure orders and contracts, we may have to offer comparable products and services at lower pricing which could adversely affect our operating margins. Our inability to compete effectively against these larger companies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. \n\n**_We may not be able to keep pace with technological advances in the drone industry._**\n\nThe drone industry continues to undergo significant changes, primarily related to technological developments. The rapid growth of technology makes it impossible to predict the overall effect these factors could have on the drone industry. If we are not able to keep pace with these technological advances, then our revenues, profitability and results from operations may be materially adversely affected.\n\n**_Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations._**\n\nThe threats to network and data security are increasingly diverse and sophisticated. Despite our efforts and processes to prevent breaches, our devices, as well as our servers, computer systems, and those of third parties that we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. These risks include cyber-attacks such as viruses and worms, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, employee theft or misuse, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our servers and computer systems or those of third parties that we use in our operations. The occurrence of any of these events could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, unauthorized access to user data, and loss of consumer confidence. In addition, we may be the target of email scams that attempt to acquire personal information or company assets. Despite our efforts to create security barriers to such threats, we may not be able to entirely mitigate these risks. Any cyber-attack that attempts to obtain our data and assets, disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. A cyber attack would be expensive to remedy and could damage our reputation. In addition, any such breaches may result in negative publicity, adversely affect our brand, decrease demand for our products and services, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\n\n19   \n---  \n  \n**Risks Related to Our Enterprise Segment**\n\n**_U.S. government contracts are generally not fully funded at inception and may include provisions that are not favorable to us which could adversely impact our cash flows and results of operations._**\n\nUS government contracts often have long lead times for design and development and can be subject to significant changes in delivery timelines. Congress normally appropriates funds on its fiscal year basis, and it may not fully fund a program in the same fiscal year. Depending upon the results of political elections, the actions of Congress can change from one fiscal year to the next. As a result, we may be required to expend funds to fulfill existing orders, but subsequently have the delivery timeline extended or the order cancelled. Such results would have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\n\n**_A decline in U.S. government budgets, changes in spending priorities, or delays in contract awards could adversely affect the revenues of our Teal subsidiary._**\n\nWe presently expect that much of our future revenue growth will be generated by our wholly owned subsidiary, Teal Drones, and that their primary customer is likely to be the U.S. government and its agencies. As a result, our business may be adversely impacted due to changes in the political environment, including those related to changes in the leadership of the current and or future administrations. We cannot provide assurance that the current levels of congressional funding, for defense in general, and for drones specifically, will continue at their current levels or decrease in the future. If annual budget appropriations are not enacted on a timely basis, we could encounter government shutdowns which could adversely impact any existing programs including the timely payment of prior shipments, as well as the receipt of future orders.\n\n**_Our work for the U.S. government could expose us to security risks._**\n\nWe expect that an increasing percentage of our revenues will come from the U.S. government and its agencies. This may expose us to numerous security threats, including cyber security attacks on our information technology infrastructure as well as threats to the physical safety of our facilities and our employees. We utilize numerous controls and procedures to monitor and prevent these threats, however, we can provide no assurance that they will be effective. Any improper use of our data, information technology systems or facilities could adversely impact our operations and operating results.\n\n**_We are subject to extensive government regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties that may adversely impact our ability to operate our business._**\n\nAs a vendor to the U.S. government and other state and local agencies, we are subject to and must comply with numerous government regulations which impact how we operate our business. These regulations could adversely affect our revenues, operating costs and profit margins. Some of the regulations to which we are subject, and the federal agencies which administer these regulations, include:\n\n | Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the use of airspace for all aircraft, including UAS such as drones  \n---|---  \n | The Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of all factual pricing and cost data in contract negotiations  \n---|---  \n | The Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the formation and administration, as well as the performance, under government contracts  \n---|---  \n | The False Statements Act and The False Claims Act which imposes penalties on payments made on the basis of facts provided to the government  \n---|---  \n | The Federal Communications Commission which regulates the wireless spectrum upon which drones depend for data transmission  \n---|---  \n  \n20   \n---  \n  \nIt is expensive and time consuming to comply with the regulations and requirements of these federal government agencies. The costs incurred to maintain compliance will adversely impact our operating costs and could delay our ability to operate profitably in the future, if at all.\n\n**Risks Related to Our Common Stock**\n\n**_Our management has voting control of the Company_**.\n\nJeffrey Thompson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, owns approximately 17% of our common stock, and our current officers and directors currently own approximately 21% of our common stock. If they act together, they will be able to influence the outcome of all corporate actions requiring approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions which may result in corporate actions that other stockholders do not agree with. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. \n\n**_Our failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have an adverse impact on the Company_**.\n\nWe are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish and maintain those controls could adversely impact public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management’s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed which may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure of management’s assessment of our internal controls, or disclosure of our public accounting firm’s attestation to our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\n\n**_We have never paid dividends and we do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future._**\n\nWe have reported net losses every year since inception. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. If we ever become profitable, we do not expect to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of future cash dividends, if any, depend upon, among other things, conditions then existing including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements, business opportunities and other factors. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock, will be the sole source of gain for investors for the foreseeable future. \n\n**_The listing of our securities on Nasdaq subjects us to additional regulations and compliance requirements._**\n\nWe are required to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. These include certain financial and liquidity criteria to maintain such listing. If we fail to meet any of Nasdaq’s listing standards, our securities may be delisted. Nasdaq requires that the trading price of its listed stocks remain above one dollar for the stock to remain listed. If a listed stock trades below one dollar for more than 30 consecutive trading days, then it is subject to delisting from Nasdaq.\n\nWhile our stock has been trading above $1 per share, the stock price may trade below $1 per share in the future. In addition, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director and committee independence requirements, minimum stockholders’ equity, and certain corporate governance requirements. If we are unable to satisfy these requirements or standards, we could be subject to delisting which would have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair an investor’s ability to sell or purchase our common stock. In the event of a delisting, we would expect to take actions to restore our compliance with the listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price, improve the liquidity of our common stock, or prevent future non-compliance with the listing requirements. A delisting of our securities from Nasdaq may materially impair our stockholders’ ability to buy and sell our securities and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our securities.\n\n21   \n---  \n  \n**_Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue shares of new classes of stock that could adversely affect current holders of our common stock._**\n\nOur Board of Directors has the power to authorize and issue shares of classes of stock, including preferred stock that have voting powers, designations, preferences, limitations and special rights, including preferred distribution rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and liquidation rights without further shareholder approval. These powers could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, our board could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing common stockholders.\n\nAny of these actions could significantly adversely affect the investment made by holders of our common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock could receive less proceeds in connection with any future sale of the Company, in liquidation or on any other basis.\n\n**_Our shares will be subordinate to all of our debts and liabilities which increases the risk that investors could lose their entire investment._**\n\nOur shares of common stock are equity interests that will be subordinate to all of our current and future indebtedness with respect to claims on our assets. In any liquidation, all of our debts and liabilities must be paid before any payment is made to our shareholders. \n\n**_The market price of our shares of common stock is subject to fluctuation._**\n\nThe market prices of our shares may fluctuate significantly in response to a wide range of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\n | The announcement and release of new products by our competitors  \n---|---  \n | Developments in our industry or target markets  \n | General market conditions including factors unrelated to our operating performance  \n | National or international economic or political events which result in a material effect on the stock market  \n  \nThe stock market has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme market volatility in the price of our shares of common stock which could cause a decline in the value of our shares.\n\n**_Future capital raises may dilute our existing stockholders’ ownership and adversely impact the fair value of their investment._**\n\nIf we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders’ percentage ownership may decrease, and these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt instruments, these debt instruments could impose significant restrictions on our operations including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us or could diminish the rights of our stockholders. Any of these developments could adversely impact our stock price.\n\n**Risks Related to Regulatory Matters**\n\n**_The drone industry is subject to various laws and government regulations which could complicate and delay our ability to introduce products, maintain compliance, and avoid violations which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations._**\n\nWe operate in the drone industry which is a highly regulated environment in the US and international markets. Federal, state, and local governmental entities and foreign governments may regulate aspects of the industry, including the production or distribution of our products, software or services. These regulations may include accounting standards, taxation requirements, product safety, trade restrictions, environmental regulations, products directed toward children or hobbyists, and other administrative and regulatory restrictions. While we endeavor to take all the steps necessary to comply with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we can maintain compliance on a continuing basis. Failure to comply could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions which could increase our costs or decrease our revenue resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n22   \n---  \n  \n**_Our business and products are subject to government regulation, and we may incur additional compliance costs or be forced to suspend or cease operations if we fail to comply._**\n\nWe must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations, standards and other requirements governing, among other things, electrical safety, wireless emissions, health and safety, e-commerce, consumer protection, export and import requirements, hazardous materials usage, product-related energy consumption, packaging, recycling and environmental matters. Compliance with these laws, regulations, standards, and other requirements may be onerous and expensive, and they may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction (including from country to country), further increasing the cost of compliance and doing business. Our products may require regulatory approvals or satisfaction of other regulatory concerns in the various jurisdictions in which they are manufactured, sold or both. These requirements create procurement and design challenges that require us to incur additional costs identifying suppliers and manufacturers who can obtain and produce compliant materials, parts and products. Failure to comply with such requirements can subject us to liability, additional costs, and reputational harm and, in extreme cases, force us to recall products or prevent us from selling our products in certain jurisdictions. If there is a new regulation, or change to an existing regulation that significantly increases our costs of manufacturing or causes us to significantly alter the way that we manufacture our products, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, and agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures.\n\nOur products must comply with certain requirements of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulating electromagnetic radiation in order to be sold in the United States and with comparable requirements of the regulatory authorities of the European Union (“EU”), Japan, China and other jurisdictions. Our first-person view products include wireless radios and receivers which require additional emission testing. We are also subject to various environmental laws and governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, and other hazardous chemicals used in the third-party components incorporated into our products, including the Restriction of Certain Hazardous Substances Directive (the “RoHS Directive”) and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the “WEEE Directive”), as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. This directive restricts the distribution of products within the EU that exceed very low maximum concentration amounts of certain substances, including lead. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, Japan, and numerous countries around the world and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States. We are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\n\nOur products may be subject to new domestic and international requirements. Compliance with regulations enacted in the future could substantially increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business. Failure to comply with regulations in the future could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations or sales in the applicable jurisdictions. Any such failure to comply with regulations may also result in our not being permitted, or limit our ability, to ship our products which would adversely affect our revenue and ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\n\nAlthough we encourage our contract manufacturers and major component suppliers to comply with the supply chain transparency requirements, such as the RoHS Directive, we cannot provide assurance that our manufacturers and suppliers consistently comply with these requirements. In addition, if there are changes to these or other laws or if new related laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs or disrupt our operations or logistics.\n\nThe WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such products. Changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present, and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. Although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\n\n23   \n---  \n  \n**_Our results of operations may suffer if we are not able to successfully manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate risks._**\n\nA substantial majority of our sales and cost of components are denominated in U.S. dollars. As our business grows, more of our sales and production costs may be denominated in other currencies. Where such sales or production costs are denominated in other currencies, they are converted to U.S. dollars for the purpose of calculating any sales or costs to us. Our sales may decrease as a result of any appreciation of the U.S. dollar against these other currencies.\n\nMost of our current expenditures are incurred in U.S. dollars and many of our components come from countries that currently base their currency against the U.S. dollar. If the exchange rates change adversely or are allowed to increase, then additional U.S. dollars will be required to fund our purchases of these components.\n\nAlthough we do not currently enter into currency option contracts or engage in other hedging activities, we may do so in the future. There is no assurance that we will undertake any such hedging activities or that, if we do so, they will be successful in reducing the risks associated with our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n**_Our international operations, including the use of foreign contract manufacturers, subjects us to international operational, financial, legal, political and public health risks which could harm our operating results._**\n\nA substantial part of our operations, including manufacturing of certain components used in our products, are outside of the United States and many of our customers and suppliers have some or all of their operations in countries other than the United States. Risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States include:\n\n | compliance burdens and costs associated with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, particularly labor and environmental, that govern our operations in those countries;  \n---|---  \n | legal uncertainties regarding foreign taxes, tariffs, border taxes, quotas, and export controls,  \n---|---  \n | export licenses, import controls and other trade barriers;  \n---|---  \n | economic instability and high levels of inflation in certain countries where our suppliers are located and  \n---|---  \n | customers, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, causing delays or reductions in orders for their products and therefore our sales;  \n---|---  \n | political or public health instability, including global pandemics, in the countries in which our suppliers operate;  \n---|---  \n | changes or volatility in currency exchange rates;  \n---|---  \n | difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer accounts receivable payment cycles; and  \n---|---  \n | Any of these factors could harm our own, our suppliers’ and our customers’ international operations and businesses and impair our and/or their ability to continue expanding into international markets.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate._**\n\nThe global nature of our business creates various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. We operate in areas of the world that experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anticorruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our global operations require us to import from several countries which geographically expands our compliance obligations. In addition, changes in such laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. \n\n24   \n---  \n  \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions prohibit U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to another, or securing an advantage. In addition, U.S. public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As a result, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\n\n**_We are subject to governmental export and import controls, and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets._**\n\nThe U.S. and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies. Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, including the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanction regulations established by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our products must be made in compliance with these laws. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of U.S. sanctions, our products could be provided to those targets or provided by our customers despite such precautions. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, and reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.\n\n**_Changes in trade policy in the United States and other countries may have adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition._**\n\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to alter its approach to international trade policy through the renegotiation, and potential termination, of certain trade agreements and treaties with China, countries in EMEA and other countries. These changes could include the imposition of additional tariffs on a wide range of products. Policy changes in the United States or other countries, such as the tariffs already proposed, implemented, and threatened, present risks for us. Tariffs already announced and implemented are having an adverse effect on certain of our products, tariffs announced but not yet implemented may have an adverse effect on many of our products, and threatened tariffs could adversely affect more or all of our products. There are also risks associated with retaliatory tariffs and resulting trade wars. We cannot predict future trade policy, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs and their impact on our business. A trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, or limit the amount of, our products or components or materials used in our products imported into the United States or other countries, or create adverse tax consequences, the sales, cost or gross profit of our products may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished. Uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending. If we deem it necessary to alter all or a portion of our activities or operations in response to such policies, agreements or tariffs, our capital and operating costs may increase. Our ongoing efforts to address these risks may not be effective and may have long-term adverse effects on our operations and operating results that we may not be able to reverse. Such efforts may also take time to implement or to have an effect, and may result in adverse quarterly financial results or fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. As a result, changes in international trade policy, changes in trade agreements and tariffs could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n**_We may collect, store, process and use the personal information of our customers which subjects us to governmental regulation related to privacy, information security and data protection. Any cybersecurity breaches or our failure to comply with such legal obligations by us, or by our third-party service providers or partners, could harm our business._**\n\nWe may collect, store, process and use the personally identifiable information of our customers and other data in our transactions with them. We also rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. While we take reasonable measures to protect the security, integrity and confidentiality of the personal information and other sensitive information we collect, store or transmit, we cannot guarantee that inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure will not occur, or that third parties will not gain unauthorized access to this information. While our privacy policies currently prohibit such activities, our third-party service providers or partners may engage in such activity without our knowledge or consent. If we or our third- party service providers were to experience a breach, disruption or failure of systems compromising our customers’ data, or if one of our third-party service providers or partners were to access our customers’ personal data without our authorization, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected, use of our products could decrease, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation and regulatory proceedings. \n\n25   \n---  \n  \nRegulatory scrutiny of privacy, data collection, use of data and data protection is intensifying globally, and the personal information and other data we collect, store, process and use is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, especially in Europe. These laws often develop in ways we cannot predict and may materially increase our cost of doing business, particularly as we expand the nature and types of products we offer.\n\nData protection legislation is becoming increasingly common in the United States at both the federal and state level. For example, in 2020, the State of California implemented the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \"CCPA\"). The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The burdens of compliance imposed by the CCPA (and other similar laws that may be enacted at the federal and state level) may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and/or to incur substantial expenditures.\n\n**Risks Related to Intellectual Property**\n\n**_Our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others._**\n\nCompanies in the electronics, wireless communications, semiconductor, IT, and display industries steadfastly pursue and protect intellectual property rights, often resulting in considerable and costly litigation to determine the validity of patents and claims by third parties of infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights. Our products could be found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. Other companies may hold or obtain patents or inventions or other proprietary rights in technology necessary for our business. Periodically, other companies inquire about our products and technology in their attempts to assess whether we violate their intellectual property rights. If we are forced to defend against infringement claims, we may face costly litigation, diversion of technical and management personnel, and product shipment delays, even if the allegations of infringement are unwarranted. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us and we are unable to develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely basis, or if we are required to cease using one or more of our business or product names due to a successful trademark infringement claim against us, it could adversely affect our business.\n\n**_Our intellectual property rights and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products._**\n\nOur commercial success will depend substantially on the ability to obtain patents and other intellectual property rights and maintain adequate legal protection for products in the United States and other countries. We will be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that these assets are covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. As of the date of this filing, we own 36 granted United States and foreign patents and 16 pending United States and foreign patent applications. The U.S. patents and patent applications include claims to, among other things, a drone, a printed circuit board, and head-mounted display technology. We apply for patents covering our products, services, technologies, and designs as we deem appropriate. We may fail to apply for patents on important products, services, technologies or designs in a timely fashion, or at all. We do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents. Even if patents are issued, they may not be sufficient to protect our products, services, technologies, or designs. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from developing competing products, services technologies, or designs. Intellectual property protection and patent rights outside of the United States are even less predictable. As a result, the validity and enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, we cannot be certain whether:\n\n | we were the first to conceive, reduce to practice, invent, or file the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;  \n---|---  \n | others will independently develop similar or alternative products, technologies, services or designs or duplicate any of our products, technologies, services or designs;  \n---|---  \n | any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages, or will be challenged by third parties;  \n---|---  \n | we will develop additional proprietary products, services, technologies or designs that are patentable; or  \n---|---  \n | the patents of others will have an adverse effect on our business.  \n---|---  \n  \n26   \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY**\n\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws. To mitigate the threat to our business, we take a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity risk management. The Company’s Board of Directors as well as its Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and Chief Financial Officer are actively involved in the oversight of our risk management program, of which cybersecurity represents an important component. We have established policies, standards, processes, and practices for assessing, identifying, managing and mitigating material risks from cybersecurity threats.\n\n**Risk Assessment and Management**\n\nWe rely on a multidisciplinary team, including our information security function, management, and third-party service providers to identify, assess, remediate and manage cybersecurity threats and risks. We identify and assess risks from cybersecurity threats by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment and our risk profile using various methods including, for example, manual and automated tools, subscribing to reports and services that identify cybersecurity threats, analyzing reports of threats and threat actors, conducting scans of the threat environment, utilizing internal and external audits, and conducting threat and vulnerability assessments.\n\nAt least annually, we review our security controls and address information security vulnerabilities, conduct security testing, and assess our external sources for their security risk (e.g., security incidents, data security, security controls, third parties, etc.). The results of the assessment are used to drive alignment and prioritization of initiatives to enhance our security posture, improve security processes, and to manage a broader enterprise-level risk program that is presented to the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, and members of management.\n\nThe Company maintains various technical, physical, and organizational measures, processes, standards, and policies designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats against our information systems and data. These include:\n\n | incident detection and response  \n---|---  \n | vulnerability management  \n---|---  \n | disaster recovery plans  \n---|---  \n | internal controls within our accounting and financial reporting functions  \n---|---  \n | encryption of data  \n---|---  \n | network security controls  \n---|---  \n | access controls  \n---|---  \n | physical security  \n---|---  \n | asset management  \n---|---  \n | systems monitoring  \n---|---  \n | vendor risk management program  \n---|---  \n | employee training.  \n---|---  \n  \nNotwithstanding the approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Refer to Item 1A for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.\n\n27   \n---  \n  \n**Governance**\n\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise risk management activities, and each of our Board committees assists the Board in the role of risk oversight. The full Board receives an update on the Company’s risk management process and the risk trends related to cybersecurity at least annually. The Audit Committee specifically assists the Board of Directors in its oversight of risks related to cybersecurity.\n\n**ITEM 2. PROPERTIES**\n\nWe lease all properties where our business is operated. We believe that these properties are adequate for the purposes for which they are used. All leases are with unaffiliated third parties. We believe that the loss of any lease would not have a material adverse effect on our operations, as we believe that we could identify and lease comparable facilities upon approximately equivalent terms. The Company has the following operating leases for real estate locations where it operates:\n\n**Location** | **Monthly Rent** | **Expiration**  \n---|---|---  \nSouth Salt Lake, Utah | $ | 22,667 | December 2030  \nSan Juan, Puerto Rico | $ | 5,647 | June 2027  \nGrantsville, Utah | $ | 1,000 | December 2026  \n  \nThe South Salt Lake, Utah facility has approximately 22,000 square feet and is used for our manufacturing. The San Juan, Puerto Rico facility has approximately 3,600 square feet and is used for administrative purposes. The Grantsville, Utah property is approximately one acre and is used for drone flight operations and testing.\n\nThese lease agreements have remaining terms up to 6.67 years, including options to extend certain leases for up to six years.\n\nThe weighted average remaining lease term as of April 30, 2024 was 6.16 years. The Company used a discount rate of 12% to calculate its lease liability at April 30, 2024. Future lease payment obligations at April 30, 2024 were as follows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended:  \n---  \n2025 | $  | 366,853  \n2026 | 372,449  \n2027 | 372,880  \n2028 | 293,334  \n2029 | 280,080  \nThereafter | 443,460  \nTotal | $ | 2,129,056  \n  \n28   \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**\n\nOn September 29, 2022, we, and our wholly owned subsidiary Teal Drones, Inc., initiated a legal proceeding (the “Lawsuit”) against Autonodyne LLC (“Autonodyne”) and its principal equity owner Daniel Schwinn (“Schwinn”), in Delaware Chancery Court. The case is captioned as Red Cat Holdings, Inc., et al. v. Autonodyne LLC, et al., C.A. No. 2022-0878. The case arises from Autonodyne’s unilateral purported termination of a software licensing agreement entered between Teal Drones and Autonodyne in May 2022. Before the defendants answered, we filed a First Amended Complaint on December 5, 2022, which the defendants moved to dismiss. The court partially granted that motion, dismissing the claims asserted against Autonodyne, but not against Schwinn. For jurisdictional reasons, the case subsequently was transferred to Delaware Superior Court. The Lawsuit alleges a cause of action against Schwinn for Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations and Prospective Contractual Relations, concerning a Software Licensing Agreement between Teal Drones and Autonodyne. No discovery or other significant developments in the Lawsuit have occurred. \n\nOn May 9, 2024, Autonodyne LLC filed a complaint against wholly-owned Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones, Inc. in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware. The Complaint alleges a single cause of action, asserting that Teal breached a Software Licensing Agreement between it and Autonodyne (the “SLA”) by disclosing confidential information contained in the SLA. Autonodyne alleges that it rightfully terminated the SLA, and at that point it became entitled to $8.25 million of accelerated payments, pursuant to section 14.4(e) of the SLA. Teal Drones has answered the Complaint, but no discovery has been served yet. As any litigation is subject to many uncertainties, it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of this claim or to estimate the loss, if any, which may result. Accordingly, the outcome of the claim is not yet determinable, and the extent to which an outflow of funds may be required to settle this possible obligation cannot be reliably determined. The Company plans to vigorously assert defenses to the complaint.\n\n**ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES**\n\nNot applicable.\n\n**PART II**\n\n**ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES**\n\n**Market Information**\n\nOur common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) since April 30, 2021 under the symbol “RCAT”.\n\nThe last reported sales price of our common stock on August 5, 2024 was $1.98.\n\n**Holders**\n\nAs of August 5, 2024, there were 127 stockholders of record of our common stock.\n\n**Dividends**\n\nThe Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate that it will pay dividends in the foreseeable future. It intends to use any future earnings for the expansion of its business. Any future determination of applicable dividends will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant.\n\n**Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities**\n\nThere were no sales of equity securities during the period covered by this Annual Report that were not registered under the Securities Act and were not previously reported in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company.\n\n**Purchase of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers**\n\nWe did not repurchase any securities in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report.\n\n29   \n---  \n  \n**ITEM 6. RESERVED**\n\n**ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. For more information regarding forward-looking statements, please refer to the discussion above under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements.”\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nCorporate developments during the two years ended April 30, 2024 include:\n\n**_Capital Transactions_**\n\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company completed two firm commitment underwritten public offerings with ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management. The first offering, in May 2021, generated gross and net proceeds of $16 and $14.6 million, respectively. The second offering, in July 2021, generated gross and net proceeds of $60 and $55.5 million, respectively.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, the Company completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering with ThinkEquity of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated gross and net proceeds of $9.2 and $8.4 million, respectively.\n\n**Plan of Operations**\n\nSince April 2016, the Company's primary business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which it presently does through its four wholly owned subsidiaries. Beginning in January 2020, the Company expanded the scope of its drone products and services through four acquisitions, including:\n\nA. | In January 2020, the Company acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (FPV) drones and equipment, primarily to the consumer marketplace. The purchase price was $1,995,114.  \n---|---  \nB. | In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings, a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was $8,354,076.  \n---|---  \nC. | In May 2021, the Company acquired Skypersonic which provides hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.  \n---|---  \nD. |  In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal Drones, a leader in commercial and government UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) technology. The purchase price was $10,011,279.  \n---|---  \n  \nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment and the Consumer segment to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. The Enterprise segment’s initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, the segment narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\n\n30   \n---  \n  \nThe Enterprise segment’s current business strategy is focused on providing integrated robotic hardware and software for use across a variety of applications. Its solutions provide critical situational awareness and actionable intelligence to on-the-ground warfighters and battlefield commanders as well as firefighters and public safety officials. Our Enterprise segment’s efforts are centered on developing and scaling an American made family of systems. We have since completed construction of a manufacturing facility in Salt Lake City and believe that an increased focus by the United States government and American businesses on purchasing products that are “Made in America” provide our Enterprise segment with a competitive advantage.\n\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects our decision to focus our efforts and capital on defense where we believe there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nThe analysis of the Company's results of operations for the year ended April 30, 2024 (\"Fiscal 2024\") compared to the year ended April 30, 2023 (\"Fiscal 2023\") includes only the Company’s Enterprise segment as our Consumer segment was divested in February 2024. At the end of Fiscal 2023, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $2,826,918 related to Skypersonic goodwill which was written down to zero. In addition, its operations were consolidated into Teal. Skypersonic's operating results represented 0% and 2% of consolidated revenues and operating loss for Fiscal 2024. Based on its immateriality, Skypersonic is not included in the operating analysis set forth below.\n\n**Discussion and Analysis of Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023**\n\nRevenues\n\nConsolidated revenues totaled $17,836,382 during the year ended April 30, 2024 (or the \"2024 period\") compared to $4,620,834 during the year ended April 30, 2023 (or the \"2023 period\") representing an increase of $13,215,548, or 286%. The increase primarily related to higher product revenue related to the launch of the Teal 2 in April 2023. Product revenue totaled $13,588,372 during the year ended April 30, 2024 compared to $3,012,470 during the year ended April 30, 2023 representing an increase of $10,575,902, or 351%. The increase in revenue also partially related to increased contract revenues during the 2024 period. Contract revenues totaled $4,173,005 during the 2024 period compared to $1,312,427 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $2,860,578, or 218%. Contract revenues are primarily sourced through government agencies and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of award deliverables and amendments.\n\nGross Profit\n\nConsolidated gross profit totaled $3,680,546 during the 2024 period compared to negative $834,311 during the 2023 period representing an increase of $4,514,857, or 541%. On a percentage basis, gross profit was 21% during the 2024 period compared to negative 18% during the 2023 period. The percentage basis increase in gross profit in the 2024 period primarily related to obsolete inventory write-offs that occurred during the 2023 period. Additionally, lower manufacturing levels in the 2023 period resulted in higher relative overhead costs compared to the 2024 period. Our manufacturing facility is presently producing drones at a lower level than it is designed for, and these lower production levels, combined with higher overhead costs, continue to result in lower than targeted gross profits. As production levels increase, our fixed overhead costs, including labor, are expected to be allocated to a greater number of drones which is expected to drive our per-drone production costs lower and increase gross profits.\n\nOperating Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses totaled $5,896,037 during the 2024 period compared to $5,595,281 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $300,756, or 5%. Supplies and materials expense totaled $2,017,979 in the 2024 period compared to $1,444,051 in the 2023 period. This increase of $573,928, or 40%, primarily related to increased efforts in developing new products and represented substantially all of the total increase in research and development costs.\n\nSales and marketing costs totaled $4,568,617 during the 2024 period compared to $3,731,776 during the 2023 period, representing an increase of $836,841 or 22%. The increase was driven by higher payroll expenses to support increased sales efforts of the Teal 2.\n\n31   \n---  \n  \nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $10,679,105 during the 2024 period compared to $12,383,470 during the 2023 period, representing a decrease of $1,704,365 or 14%. The decrease primarily related to lower professional fees.\n\nDuring the 2024 period, we incurred stock-based compensation costs of $3,609,267 compared to $3,656,724 in the 2023 period, resulting in a decrease of $47,457 or 1%.\n\nOther Income\n\nOther expense totaled $3,650,484 during the 2024 period compared to $1,004,887 during the 2023 period, representing a decrease of $2,645,597 or 263%. During the 2024 period, the divestiture of the Consumer segment resulted in a gain of $9,642,427, impairment of $11,353,875, and an equity method loss of $503,625. Additionally, during the 2024 period, the Company was awarded a manufacturing modernization grant from the State of Utah for $750,000 of which $675,000 is attributable to the 2024 period.\n\nNet Loss from Continuing Operations\n\nNet loss from continuing operations totaled $21,526,696 for the 2024 period compared to $26,376,643 for the 2023 period, resulting in a decrease of $4,849,947 or 18%. Total operating expenses totaled $21,556,758 for the 2024 period compared to $24,537,445 for the 2023 period. The decrease in operating expenses was offset by the increase in other expense. Higher gross profit is attributable to the decrease in net loss from continuing operations.\n\nResults of Discontinued Operations\n\nNet loss from discontinued operations totaled $2,525,933 for the 2024 period compared to $1,730,386 for the 2023 period, representing an increase of $795,547, or 46%. Net loss for Fat Shark totaled $1,365,707 for the 2024 period, compared to $543,962 for the 2023 period, representing an increase of $821,745 or 151%, and represents 103% of the total increase in net loss from discontinued operations. Fat Shark’s results were adversely impacted by a charge of $1,244,920 during the 2024 period related to the write-off of excess quantities of Dominator inventory based on sales volumes. Net loss for Rotor Riot totaled $1,160,226 for the 2024 period compared to $1,186,424 for the 2023 period, representing a decrease of $26,198 or 2%.\n\n**Cash Flows**\n\n**_Operating Activities_**\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $17,687,063 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in operating activities of $24,313,674 during the 2023 period, representing a decrease of $6,626,611 or 27%. The decreased use of cash primarily related to timing of accounts receivable receipts for government customers. Net cash used in operations, net of non-cash expenses, totaled $8,512,449 during the 2024 period, compared to $7,784,364 during the 2023 period, resulting in an increase of $728,085, or 9%. Net cash used related to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $4,672,816 during the 2024 period, compared to $5,721,395 during the 2023 period, representing a decrease of $1,048,579 or 18%. Changes in operating assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending upon the timing and level of multiple factors, including inventory purchases, vendor payments, and customer collections.\n\n**_Investing Activities_**\n\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $13,567,078 during the 2024 period compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $29,590,235 during the 2023 period, resulting in a decrease of $16,023,157 or 54%. Proceeds of $12,826,217 and $32,290,448 from the sale of marketable securities were used to fund operations during the 2024 period and the 2023 period, respectively.\n\n**_Financing Activities_**\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $7,802,076 during the 2024 period compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,215,325 during the 2023 period. Financing activities can vary from period to period depending upon market conditions, both at a macro-level and specific to the Company. During the fiscal 2024 period, the company received net proceeds from issuance of common stock of $8,395,600.\n\n32   \n---  \n  \n**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**\n\nAt April 30, 2024, the Company reported current assets totaling $22,397,549, current liabilities totaling $3,651,130 and net working capital of $18,746,419. Cash totaled $6,067,169 at April 30, 2024. Inventory related balances, including pre-paid inventory, totaled $8,610,125.\n\n**_Going Concern_**\n\nThe Company has never been profitable and has incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue its long-term growth strategy. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $21,526,696 and used cash in operating activities of continuing operations of $17,687,063. As of April 30, 2024, working capital for continuing operations totaled $18,746,419. These financial results and our financial position at April 30, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. However, the Company has recently taken actions to strengthen its liquidity. On December 11, 2023, we completed a public offering of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000. Subsequent to year end, the Company sold its equity method investment for $4,400,000. In addition, the Company’s operating plan for the next twelve months has been updated to reflect recent operating improvements. Revenues have accelerated and are expected to continue growing. The Company’s manufacturing facility is scaling production and gross profits are projected to increase. If necessary, the Company will seek to obtain additional debt financing for which there can be no guarantee. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue its operations, and meet its financial obligations, for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n\n**_Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates_**\n\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. \n\nSignificant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets, including goodwill, for impairment, and (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity method investments.\n\n**Goodwill and Long-lived Assets** – Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of  _ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,_(“ASC 350”). Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. ASC 350 provides that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the amount that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\n33   \n---  \n  \nThe estimate of fair value of a reporting unit is computed using either an income approach, a market approach, or a combination of both. Under the income approach, we utilize the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. Significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future cash flows, growth assumptions for future revenues (including gross profit, operating expenses, and capital expenditures), and a rate used to discount estimated future cash flow projections to their present value based on estimated weighted average cost of capital (i.e., the selected discount rate). Our assumptions are based on historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management’s plans. Under the market approach, fair value is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate and consider risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. \n\n**Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures** – The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nThe guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\n_Level 1_ : Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n\n_Level 2_ : Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n\n_Level 3_ : Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.\n\n_Financial Instruments_\n\nThe Company's financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and current debt approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\n**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**\n\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements.\n\n**_Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements_**\n\nThe Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect.

(the “Company”) as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\n**Basis for Opinion**\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n**Critical Audit Matters**\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audits of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n_Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles_\n\nAs discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements, the Company acquired various businesses which resulted in the recording of significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The intangible assets management identified consisted of proprietary technology and tradenames. Management determined the fair value of the intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used the model to determine fair value were cash flow projections, the discount rate, long-term growth rates, effective tax rate and the estimated periods to be benefitted of the identifiable intangible assets with definite lives.\n\nWe identified the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets for the businesses acquired as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes in determining the estimates. Auditing management’s assumptions involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of valuation specialists, as management’s assumptions are subjective, and changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of the businesses acquired.\n\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s valuation of goodwill and intangible assets for the businesses acquired included the following, among others:\n\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s cash flow projections by comparing management’s prior forecasts to historical results for the Company, as well as inquiry of management of the reporting unit regarding the expected future operations, review of publicly available industry information, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the projections.\n\nAdditionally, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s use of various rates and other assumptions by comparing them to comparable companies and market data.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the estimated periods to be benefitted of the identifiable intangible assets with definite lives by comparing to comparable companies and market data, as well as recalculating the current and accumulated amortization.\n\n/s/ dbbmckennon\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2024.\n\nNewport Beach, California\n\nAugust 8, 2024 \n\nF-2   \n---  \n  \n**RED CAT HOLDINGS, INC.**\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**\n\nApril 30, | April 30,  \n---|---  \n2024 | 2023  \nASSETS | (As restated)   \nCurrent assets  \nCash | $ | 6,067,169 | $ | 3,173,649  \nMarketable securities |  — | 12,814,038  \nAccounts receivable, net | 4,361,090 | 719,862  \nInventory | 8,007,237 | 8,920,573  \nOther | 3,962,053 | 1,263,735  \nCurrent assets of discontinued operations |  — | 5,283,155  \nTotal current assets | 22,397,549 | 32,175,012  \nGoodwill | 9,088,550 | 17,012,832  \nIntangible assets, net | 3,794,389 | 6,893,115  \nEquity method investee | 5,142,500 |  —  \nNote receivable | 4,000,000 |  —  \nProperty and equipment, net | 2,340,684 | 2,650,358  \nOther | 293,126 | 303,180  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | 1,480,814 | 1,600,434  \nLong-term assets of discontinued operations |  — | 108,397  \nTotal long-term assets | 26,140,063 | 28,568,316  \nTOTAL ASSETS | $ | 48,537,612 | $ | 60,743,328  \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY  \nCurrent liabilities  \nAccounts payable | $ | 1,580,422 | $ | 1,392,550  \nAccrued expenses | 1,069,561 | 409,439  \nDebt obligations -

Since April 2016, the Company’s primary business has been to provide products, services, and solutions to the drone industry which it presently does through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries. Beginning in January 2020, the Company expanded the scope of its drone products and services through four acquisitions, including: \n\nA. | In January 2020, the Company acquired Rotor Riot, a provider of First Person View (“FPV”) drones and equipment, primarily to consumers. The purchase price was $1,995,114.  \n---|---  \nB. | In November 2020, the Company acquired Fat Shark Holdings (“Fat Shark”), a provider of FPV video goggles to the drone industry. The purchase price was $8,354,076.  \n---|---  \nC. | In May 2021, the Company acquired Skypersonic which provided hardware and software solutions that enable drones to complete inspection services in locations where GPS is either denied or not available, yet still record and transmit data even while being operated from thousands of miles away. The purchase price was $2,791,012.  \n---|---  \nD. | In August 2021, the Company acquired Teal Drones (“Teal”), a leader in commercial and government Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (“UAV”) technology. The purchase price was $10,011,279.  \n---|---  \n  \nFollowing the Teal acquisition in August 2021, we concentrated on integrating and organizing these businesses. Effective May 1, 2022, we established the Enterprise segment (“Enterprise”) and the Consumer segment (“Consumer”) to focus on the unique opportunities in each sector. Enterprise's initial strategy was to provide UAVs to commercial enterprises, and the military, to navigate dangerous military environments and confined industrial and commercial interior spaces. Subsequently, Enterprise narrowed its near-term attention on the military and other government agencies. Skypersonic's technology has been redirected to military applications and its operations consolidated into Teal.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, the Company completed a firm commitment underwritten public offering with ThinkEquity of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated gross proceeds of $9,200,000 and net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000.\n\nOn February 16, 2024, we closed the sale of our Consumer segment, consisting of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, to Unusual Machines. The sale reflects the Company's decision to focus its efforts and capital on defense where it believes that there are more opportunities to create long term shareholder value. See Note 3 and Note 9.\n\n**Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies**\n\n**Basis of Accounting **– The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Certain prior period amounts have been restated to conform to the current year presentation.\n\n**Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements **– The Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 30, 2023, Consolidated Statement of Operations, Stockholders’ Equity and Cash Flows for the year then ended, and its Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended April 30, 2023, which were originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 27, 2023 (the “Original Form 10-K”), have been restated. The Company revised its accounting estimate of the life of an operating lease that was previously reported in its Original Form 10-K. Upon further evaluation, the Company determined that prior year adjustments were necessary. These Consolidated Financial Statements were restated to reflect a change in accounting estimate of the life of the operating lease under FASB ASC Topic 842 from three to nine years. Additionally, the Company revised its financial statements to remove derivative liabilities due to erroneously reporting warrants from our convertible note financings, as described in Note 18, as having a derivative component.\n\nF-7   \n---  \n  \nThe impacts of these restatements are detailed in the tables below:\n\n**Consolidated Balance Sheet** **As of April 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Originally** **Reported** |  **As** **Restated** | Change  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets | $ | 620,307 | $ | 1,600,434 | $ | 980,127  \nTotal long-term assets | 28,018,078 | 28,568,316 | 550,238  \nOperating lease liabilities, current | 281,797 | 159,423 | (122,374 | )  \nWarrant derivative liability | 588,205 |  — | (588,205 | )  \nTotal current liabilities | 4,760,616 | 4,050,037 | (710,579 | )  \nOperating lease liabilities, long-term | 379,466 | 1,481,967 | 1,102,501  \nTotal long-term liabilities | 822,849 | 1,925,350 | 1,102,501  \nAdditional paid-in capital | 109,993,100 | 112,642,726 | 2,649,626  \nAccumulated deficit | (54,586,793 | ) | (57,078,103 | ) | (2,491,310 | )  \nTotal shareholders’ equity | 54,609,625 | 54,767,941 | 158,316  \nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity | $ | 60,193,090 | $ | 60,743,328 | $ | 550,238  \n**Consolidated Statement of Operations** **For the year ended April 30, 2023**  \n---  \n**Originally** **Reported** |  **As** **Restated** | Change  \nChange in fair value of derivative liability | $ | (1,019,292 | ) | $ |  — | $ | 1,019,292  \nNet loss | $ | (27,087,737 | ) | $ | (28,107,029 | ) | $ | (1,019,292 | )  \n  \nAmounts presented as originally reported as of April 30, 2023 are exclusive of Discontinued Operations with the exception of (i) change in fair value of derivative liability, (ii) net loss, and (iii) Consolidated Balance Sheet totals. The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows is not presented above as there was no change in net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations.\n\n**Principles of Consolidation** – Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries which include Teal and Skypersonic as well as Rotor Riot and Fat Shark which were sold on February 16, 2024. Non-majority owned investments, including the formerly wholly owned subsidiaries Rotor Riot and Fat Shark, are accounted for using the equity method when the Company is able to significantly influence the operating policies of the investee. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nThe Consumer segment businesses are characterized as discontinued operations in these financial statements. The operating results and cash flows of discontinued operations are separately stated in those respective financial statements. See Note 3. \n\n**Use of Estimates** – The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates reflected in these financial statements include those used to (i) complete purchase price accounting for acquisitions, (ii) the evaluation of long-term assets, including goodwill, for impairment, and (iii) the evaluation of other-than-temporary-impairment of equity method investments.\n\n**Cash and Cash Equivalents **– At April 30, 2024, we had cash of $6,067,169 in multiple commercial banks and financial services companies. We have not experienced any loss on these cash balances and believe they are not exposed to any significant credit risk.\n\nF-8   \n---  \n  \n**Marketable Securities **– Our marketable securities were classified and accounted for as available-for-sale securities. These securities were primarily invested in corporate bonds and were readily saleable, and therefore, we have classified them as short term. Our available-for-sale securities were carried at fair value with any unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of comprehensive income (loss). Once realized, any gains or losses were recognized in the statement of operations.\n\nWe have elected to present accrued interest income separately from marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Accrued interest income was $0 and $151,671 as of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively, and was included in other current assets. We did not write off any accrued interest income during the years ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023.\n\n**Accounts Receivable, net** – Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company's estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a multitude of factors, including historical bad debt levels for its customer base, experience with a specific customer, the economic environment, and other factors. Accounts receivable balances are written off against the allowance when it is probable that the receivable will not be collected.\n\n**Concentration of Credit Risk **– Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, include trade receivables. In the normal course of business, the Company provides credit terms to its customers. Accordingly, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, generally does not require collateral and considers the credit risk profile of the customer from which the receivable is due in further evaluating collection risk. Customers that accounted for 10% or greater of accounts receivable, net as of April 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n\nApril 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nCustomer A | 53 | % | 20 | %  \nCustomer B | 24 | % | *  \nCustomer C | *  | 24 | %  \nCustomer D | *  | 14 | %  \nCustomer E | *  | 10 | %  \n  \n* Accounts Receivable was less than 10%\n\nAs of April 30, 2024, three customers accounted for equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue, totaling 28%, 23% and 10%, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, two customers accounted for equal to or greater than 10% of total revenue, totaling 22% and 20%, respectively.\n\n**Inventories** – Inventories, which consist of raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor, indirect overhead, as well as in-bound freight. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the net realizable value of its inventory using various reference measures including current product selling prices and recent customer demand, as well as evaluating for excess quantities and obsolescence.\n\n**Goodwill and Long-lived Assets** – Goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recognized. We test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of  _ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,_(“ASC 350”). Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. ASC 350 provides that an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform an impairment test. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the amount that the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n\nF-9   \n---  \n  \nThe estimate of fair value of a reporting unit is computed using either an income approach, a market approach, or a combination of both. Under the income approach, we utilize the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. Significant assumptions inherent in estimating the fair values include the estimated future cash flows, growth assumptions for future revenues (including gross profit, operating expenses, and capital expenditures), and a rate used to discount estimated future cash flow projections to their present value based on estimated weighted average cost of capital (i.e., the selected discount rate). Our assumptions are based on historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated growth rates, and management’s plans. Under the market approach, fair value is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses is based on the markets in which the reporting units operate and consider risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. \n\nGoodwill for Teal is ascribed to its existing relationship with several U.S. government agencies including its classification as an approved vendor. The Company expects that the Goodwill recognized in each transaction will be deductible for tax purposes. The Company has reported net losses since its inception and is presently unable to determine when and if the tax benefit of this deduction will be realized.\n\n**Property and equipment – **Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation which is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally: (i) furniture and fixtures - seven years, (ii) equipment and related - two to five years, and (iii) leasehold improvements – nine to fifteen years.\n\n**Equity Method Investment – **The equity method of accounting is applied to investments in which the Company has an ownership interest of between 20% and 50%. The Company evaluates its equity method investments each reporting period for evidence of a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline. Evidence of a loss in value might include, but would not necessarily be limited to, absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. The Company performed this analysis and concluded that its investment in UMAC was other-than-temporarily impaired and recognized an impairment charge of $11,353,875 for the year ended April 30, 2024.\n\n**Leases – **Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 842 requires the recognition of assets and liabilities associated with lease agreements. The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease liabilities are measured, on each reporting date, based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate. Therefore, the Company uses an effective discount rate of 12% based on its last debt financing. Operating lease assets are measured by adjusting the lease liability for lease incentives, initial direct costs incurred and asset impairments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the operating lease asset reduced by the amount of the expense. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when they are reasonably certain to occur.\n\n**Fair Values, Inputs and Valuation Techniques for Financial Assets and Liabilities, and Related Disclosures** – The fair value measurements and disclosure guidance defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In accordance with this guidance, the Company has categorized its recurring basis financial assets and liabilities into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.\n\nThe guidance establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy as follows:\n\n_Level 1_ : Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;\n\n_Level 2_ : Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and\n\nF-10   \n---  \n  \n_Level 3_ : Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data. \n\n_Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis_\n\nThe Company's financial instruments mainly consist of cash, receivables, current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and debt. The carrying amounts of these instruments approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.\n\n**Revenue Recognition **– The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). This standard includes a comprehensive evaluation of factors to be considered regarding revenue recognition including (i) identifying the promised goods, (ii) evaluating performance obligations, (iii) measuring the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations if there are multiple components, and (v) recognizing revenue as each obligation is satisfied. The Company’s revenue transactions include the shipment of goods to customers as orders are fulfilled, completion of non-recurring engineering, completion of training, and customer support services. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of product or prototypes unless otherwise specified in the purchase order or contract. Customer deposits totaled $53,939 and $155,986 at April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively. From time to time, non-recurring engineering contracts may involve the capitalization of engineering prototypes, classified as contract assets. Contract assets totaled $1,477,859 and $0 at April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nThe following table presents the Company’s revenue disaggregated by revenue type:\n\nYear Ended April 30,  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nContract related | $ | 4,173,005 | $ | 1,312,427  \nProduct related | 13,663,377 | 3,308,407  \nTotal | $ | 17,836,382 | $ | 4,620,834  \n  \n**Research and Development **– Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, materials, and a proportionate share of overhead costs such as rent.\n\n**Product Warranty - **The Company accrues an estimate of its exposure to warranty claims based upon both current and historical product sales data and warranty costs incurred. Product warranty reserves are recorded in current liabilities under accrued expenses. Warranty liability was $372,000 and $90,000 as of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023 respectively.\n\n**Income Taxes** – Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. \n\n**Recent Accounting Pronouncements **– Management does not believe that recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n**Foreign Currency – **The functional currency of our former international subsidiary, Skyset, was the local Italian currency. For that subsidiary, we translated assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates, and average monthly exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We recorded translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.\n\n**Comprehensive Loss **– Comprehensive loss consists of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other comprehensive loss refers to gains and losses that are recorded as an element of stockholders' equity but are excluded from net loss. Our other comprehensive loss is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities. During the year ended April 30, 2024, comprehensive loss was $865,738 lower than net loss, related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities totaling $864,165 and foreign currency translation adjustments of $1,573. During the year ended April 30, 2023, comprehensive loss was $609,155 lower than net loss, related to unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities totaling $610,129, partially offset by foreign currency translation adjustments of $974. \n\nF-11   \n---  \n  \n**Stock-Based Compensation **– Stock options are valued using the estimated grant-date fair value method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. Fair value is determined based on the Black-Scholes Model using inputs reflecting our estimates of expected volatility, term and future dividends. We recognize forfeitures as they occur. The fair value of restricted stock is based on our stock price on the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period which is the vesting term.\n\n**Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share** – Basic and diluted net loss per share has been calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock because they were anti-dilutive. The conversion or exercise of these common stock equivalents would dilute earnings per share if we become profitable in the future. Outstanding securities not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive include:\n\nApril 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nSeries B Preferred Stock, as converted | 3,896 | 822,230  \nStock options | 6,779,934 | 4,784,809  \nWarrants | 2,275,999 | 1,539,999  \nRestricted stock | 175,130 | 781,060  \nTotal | 9,234,959 | 7,928,098  \n  \n**Related Parties** – Parties are considered to be related to us if they have control or significant influence, directly or indirectly, over us, including key management personnel and members of the Board of Directors or are direct relatives of key management personnel of members of the Board of Directors. Related Party transactions are disclosed in Note 20.\n\n**Liquidity and Going Concern **– The Company has never been profitable and has incurred net losses related to acquisitions, as well as costs incurred to pursue its long-term growth strategy. During the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $21,526,696 and used cash in operating activities of continuing operations of $17,687,063. As of April 30, 2024, working capital for continuing operations totaled $18,746,419. These financial results and our financial position at April 30, 2024 raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. However, the Company has recently taken actions to strengthen its liquidity. On December 11, 2023, we completed a public offering of 18,400,000 shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately $8,400,000 as further described in Note 1 and Note 16. In addition, the Company’s operating plan for the next twelve months has been updated to reflect recent operating improvements. Revenues have accelerated and are expected to continue growing. The Company’s manufacturing facility is scaling production and gross profits are projected to increase. If necessary, the Company will seek to obtain additional debt financing for which there can be no guarantee. Subsequent to year end, as further described in Note 22, the Company sold its equity method investment for $4,400,000. Management has concluded that these recent positive developments alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue its operations, and meet its financial obligations, for twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements are issued.\n\n**Note 3 – Divestiture of Consumer Segment**\n\nOn February 16, 2024,the Company closed the sale of Rotor Riot and Fat Shark to Unusual Machines. The sale was conducted pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement dated November 21, 2022, as amended on April 13, 2023, July 10, 2023, and December 11, 2023 (the “SPA”). The transaction closed concurrently with UMAC’s initial public offering and listing on the NYSE American exchange (“IPO”) under the symbol “UMAC.” \n\nThe total consideration received by the Company was valued at $20 million and consisted of i) $1 million in cash, ii) $2 million in a secured promissory note (“Promissory Note”), iii) $17 million in securities of Unusual Machines, and iv) a post-closing adjustment for excess working capital.\n\nF-13   \n---  \n  \n_Secured Promissory Note_\n\nThe Promissory Note from Unusual Machines bears interest at a rate of 8% per year, is due 18 months from the date of issue, and requires monthly payments of interest due in arrears on the 15th day of each month. In the event of a Qualified Financing (defined as one or more related debt or equity financings by UMAC resulting in net proceeds of at least $5 million, other than UMAC’s completed IPO), the Company may require payment of this Promissory Note in whole or in part upon written notice given within 10 days of the Qualified Financing. During the occurrence and continuance of any event of default under the Note, The Company may, at its option, convert the amounts due under the Note to common stock of UMAC in whole or in part from time to time. The conversion price will be a 10% discount to the average daily volume weighted average price for UMAC’s common stock over the 10 days preceding the conversion price. Conversions under the Note will be limited such that no conversion may be made to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion, the Company, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of UMAC’s common stock. This limit may be increased by the Company upon 61 days written notice.\n\n_Unusual Machines Securities_\n\nThe $17 million worth of UMAC common stock was valued at the IPO price for UMAC’s common stock of $4.00 per share, resulting in 4,250,000 shares of UMAC common stock being issued to the Company (representing approximately 49% of UMAC’s issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to the IPO and to the issuance of common stock to the Company upon closing of the IPO).\n\n_Working Capital_\n\nThe purchase price was adjusted for working capital as of the closing date. Actual working capital excess amounts increased the principal amount of the Promissory Note dollar for dollar. Working capital as of closing was finalized at $2 million, as further described in Note 22.\n\nThe Consumer segment has been classified as Discontinued Operations and reported in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. Set forth below are the results of operations for the Consumer segment for:\n\n**Year ended** **April 30,**  \n---  \n2024 | 2023  \nRevenues | $ | 4,213,653 | $ | 5,290,946  \nCost of goods sold | 4,577,980 | 4,793,430  \nGross (Loss) Profit | (364,327 | ) | 497,516  \nOperating Expenses  \nResearch and development | 118,093 | 346,002  \nSales and marketing | 1,157,448 | 862,384  \nGeneral and administrative | 863,361 | 1,044,435  \nTotal operating expenses | 2,138,902 | 2,252,821  \nOperating loss | (2,503,229 | ) | (1,755,305 | )  \nOther expense (income)  \nInterest expense | 22,856 |  —  \nOther, net | (152 | ) | (24,919 | )  \nOther expense (income) | 22,704 | (24,919 | )  \nNet loss from discontinued operations | $ | (2,525,933 | ) | $ | (1,730,386 | )  \n  \nF-14   \n---  \n  \nAssets and liabilities for the Consumer segment included:\n\nApril 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nCurrent assets  \nCash | $ |  — | $ | 86,656  \nAccounts receivable, net |  — | 61,107  \nInventory |  — | 3,065,954  \nOther |  — | 2,069,438  \nTotal current assets |  — | 5,283,155  \nIntangible assets, net |  — | 20,000  \nOther |  — | 3,853  \nOperating lease right-of-use assets |  — | 84,544  \nTotal long term assets |  — | 108,397  \nCurrent liabilities  \nAccounts payable | $ |  — | $ | 606,872  \nAccrued expenses |  — | 109,480  \nCustomer deposits |  — | 244,688  \nOperating lease liabilities |  — | 49,461  \nTotal current liabilities |  — | 1,010,501  \nLong term liabilities - Operating lease liabilities |  — | 41,814  \nWorking capital | $ |  — | $ | 4,272,654  \n  \n**Note 4 – Marketable Securities**\n\nThere were no marketable securities at April 30, 2024.\n\nAt April 30, 2023, marketable securities consisted solely of corporate bonds and were classified at Level 2 in the Fair Value Hierarchy. Fair value, cost basis, and unrealized losses totaled $12,814,038, $13,678,203, and $864,165 at April 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Note 5 – Inventories**\n\nInventories consisted of the following:\n\nApril 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nRaw materials | $ | 5,750,324 | $ | 8,132,196  \nWork-in-process | 1,289,997 | 509,381  \nFinished goods | 966,916 | 278,996  \nTotal | $ | 8,007,237 | $ | 8,920,573  \n  \nF-15   \n---  \n  \n**Note 6 – Other Current Assets**\n\nOther current assets included:\n\nApril 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nContract asset | $ | 1,477,859 | $ |  —  \nPrepaid expenses | 1,206,306 | 752,564  \nGrant receivable | 675,000 |  —  \nPrepaid inventory | 602,888 | 359,500  \nAccrued interest income |  — | 151,671  \nTotal | $ | 3,962,053 | $ | 1,263,735  \n  \n**Note 7 – Due From Related Party**\n\nIn January 2022, the Company determined that a senior executive had relocated in 2021 but their compensation had not been subject to the income tax withholding required by the new jurisdiction. The amount subject to taxation included $155,624 of cash compensation and $1,413,332 of income associated with the vesting of restricted stock (\"Stock Compensation\"). In March 2022, the Company entered into a note agreement (the \"Note\") with the employee in the amount of $510,323, representing the estimated taxes owed by the employee related to the Stock Compensation. Under the terms of the Note, 104,166 shares of common stock with a fair value of $280,832, which had vested during calendar 2021, were withheld by the Company and applied against the Note. The employee agreed not to sell or transfer 110,983 shares of common stock held at the Company's transfer agent until the Note was repaid. In addition, the employee has 20,833 shares of restricted stock vesting monthly in calendar 2022, of which 3,000 shares were withheld with the fair value of those shares applied against the Note. Shares issued to the employee in 2022 were held at the transfer agent until the Note was repaid. The Note matured on December 31, 2022. The Company filed amended payroll tax returns on March 16, 2022. In March and April 2022, the Company made payments to the relevant tax authorities totaling $712,646 representing $510,323 owed by the employee, $31,604 owed by the Company, and $170,719 of penalties and interest. The Note was repaid in full in August 2022.\n\n**Note 8 – Intangible Assets**\n\nIntangible assets relate to acquisitions completed by the Company, including those described in Note 1, and were as follows:\n\nApril 30, 2024 | April 30, 2023  \n---|---  \nGross Value | Accumulated Amortization | Net Value |  **Gross** **Value** | Accumulated Amortization | Net Value  \nProprietary technology | $ | 4,282,001 | $ | (1,917,612 | ) | $ | 2,364,389 | $ | 4,967,000 | $ | (1,271,112 | ) | $ | 3,695,888  \nNon-compete agreements | 65,000 | (65,000 | ) |  — | 81,000 | (56,667 | ) | 24,333  \nCustomer relationships |  — |  — |  — | 39,000 | (18,106 | ) | 20,894  \nTotal finite-lived assets | 4,347,001 | (1,982,612 | ) | 2,364,389 | 5,087,000 | (1,345,885 | ) | 3,741,115  \nBrand name | 1,430,000 |  — | 1,430,000 | 3,152,000 |  — | 3,152,000  \nTotal indefinite-lived assets | 1,430,000 |  — | 1,430,000 | 3,152,000 |  — | 3,152,000  \nTotal intangible assets, net | $ | 5,777,001 | $ | (1,982,612 | ) | $ | 3,794,389 | $ | 8,239,000 | $ | (1,345,885 | ) | $ | 6,893,115  \n  \nProprietary technology and non-compete agreements are being amortized over six years and three years, respectively. Customer relationships are being amortized over seven years. Goodwill and Brand name are not amortized but evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis.\n\nF-16   \n---  \n  \nAs of April 30, 2024, expected amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets for the next five years is as follows:\n\nFiscal Year Ended:  \n---  \n2025 | $ | 709,316  \n2026 | 709,316  \n2027 | 709,316  \n2028 | 236,441  \n2029 |  —  \nThereafter |  —  \nTotal | $ | 2,364,389  \n  \nGoodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from other assets acquired in an acquisition that are not individually identified and separately recognized.

Following the establishment of the Enterprise and Consumer segments, management evaluated the long-term business strategy of each segment. This resulted in the Enterprise segment narrowing its focus on the military and other government agencies. It was determined that Skypersonic's technology would be re-focused for the near term on military applications and consolidated into the operations of Teal.

We are not subject to taxation by the United States as Puerto Rico has its own taxing authority. Since inception, we have incurred net losses in each year of operations. Our current provision for the reporting periods presented in these financial statements consisted of a tax benefit against which we applied a full valuation allowance, resulting in no current provision for income taxes. In addition, there was no deferred provision for any of these reporting periods.\n\nAt April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, we had accumulated deficits of approximately $81,100,000  and $54,600,000, respectively. Deferred tax assets related to the future benefit of these net operating losses for tax purposes totaled approximately $15,004,000 and $10,101,000, respectively, calculated using the base Puerto Rico corporate tax rate of 18.5%. Currently, we focus on projected future taxable income in evaluating whether it is more likely than not that these deferred assets will be realized. Based on the fact that we have not generated an operating profit since inception, we have applied a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets at April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023.\n\nF-20   \n---  \n  \n**Note 16 – Common Stock**\n\nOur common stock has a par value of $0.001 per share.

Our accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by management, are under the general oversight of the Board’s audit committee.\n\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\n | pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;  \n---|---  \n | provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and  \n | provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \n  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nManagement assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are the measures in the Internal-Control Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (“COSO”) of the Treadway Commission.\n\n60   \n---  \n  \nBased on management’s assessment using the COSO criteria, our CEO and CFO concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, specifically pertaining to the year ended April 30, 2023 for which we restated items related to right of use assets and liabilities as well as the removal of the derivative liabilities. The Company is currently in the process of formalizing narratives and processes which are expected to mitigate these weaknesses, and has hired additional personnel to strengthen the internal control environment. \n\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.\n\nBecause the Company is a non-accelerated filer, this annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC where registrants that are non-accelerated filers are not required to provide the auditor attestation report.\n\nChanges In Controls Over Financial Reporting.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the year ended April 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n\n**ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION**\n\nDuring the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities that was intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.\"\n\n**ITEM 9C.
