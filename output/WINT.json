(“Windtree” or “the Company”) (NasdaqCM: WINT), a biotechnology company focused on advancing early and late-stage innovative therapies for critical conditions, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 and provided key business updates.\n\n“The third quarter of 2024 was marked with significant progress. We were very pleased with the SEISMiC B study results in early cardiogenic shock showing significant improvement in many measures of cardiac function and blood pressure along with a favorable safety profile in patients with heart failure and cardiogenic shock. There have been four positive Phase 2 studies with over 300 patients treated with istaroxime resulting in a consistent, unique and attractive drug profile across a wide range of severities,” said Craig Fraser, Chairman and CEO. “With trial execution and active operations comes the need for capital and we successfully completed transactions providing resources for our near-term needs as well as secured an equity line of credit to potentially support future requirements,” Mr. Fraser added. “Looking forward, we plan to accelerate enrollments in the istaroxime SCAI Stage C cardiogenic shock study with a planned interim data read out in early Q2 2025 as well as providing guidance on our strategy and planned activities with our oncology preclinical aPKCi inhibitor assets. Given what we believe to be strong data and market need, the Company is turning attention to business development activities to secure additional licenses and partnerships for our multi-asset cardiovascular platform with the objective to secure non-dilutive capital and partner resources to advance the assets to potential commercialization.”\n\n**Key Business Updates**\n\n  * Announced positive Phase 2b topline clinical results with istaroxime significantly improving cardiac function and blood pressure in heart failure patients with early cardiogenic shock. The study met its primary endpoint in significantly improving systolic blood pressure over six hours (SBP AUC) for the combined Part A and Part B SEISMiC istaroxime group compared to placebo as well as for SEISMiC Part B alone. The improvements in SBP AUC at 24 hours were also significantly increased by istaroxime and the improvements were sustained through 96 hours of measurement. Cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the heart over a minute) and filling pressures in the heart significantly improved as did measured kidney function. Heart failure severity as assessed by the NYHA classification decreased significantly up to 72 hours compared to placebo. A favorable safety and tolerability profile, including risk for cardiac arrythmias, was also observed. The clinical study data was presented in a late-breaker session at the Heart Failure Society of America conference and the Company reviewed the clinical results along with the program strategy and plans at a virtual Investor Meeting which has been posted to the Company website.\n  * Completed two private placements in July 2024 for aggregate proceeds of approximately $13.9 million, which consisted of approximately $4.4 million of new funding (with $2.3 million of net proceeds) and a $9.5 million payment through the full cancellation and extinguishment of certain holders outstanding senior notes, including secured notes, and shares of the Company’s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock.\n  * Entered into a Common Stock Purchase Agreement with an equity line investor, whereby the Company has the right, but not the obligation, to sell such investor, and, subject to limited exceptions, the investor is obligated to purchase for up to $35 million of newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock.\n  * Announced initiation of the SEISMiC C study of istaroxime in SCAI Stage C cardiogenic shock to complete Phase 2b and advance the transition to Phase 3. This is a global trial including sites in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. It is a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study with istaroxime being added to current standard of care with inotropes and/or vasopressors. The effect of istaroxime in addition to these therapies will be assessed for 6 hours and based on the patient’s condition, the ability to remove standard of care therapies while on istaroxime will also be assessed. The primary endpoint of the study is assessment of systolic blood pressure (SBP) profile over the first 6 hours of treatment.\n  * Expanded patent estate with new patents with istaroxime in cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure. Cardiogenic shock national phase filings were completed for patent applications around the world, including in the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan and China. A patent was issued for istaroxime for Japan entitled, “Istaroxime-containing intravenous formulation for the treatment of heart failure and it has been accorded Patent No. 7560134. A patent was issued for istaroxime for Hong Kong, and it is entitled, “Istaroxime-containing intravenous formulation for the treatment of heart failure (AHF).” The claims are directed formulations comprising istaroxime, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and methods of use, alone, or in combination with other agents useful for the treatment and management of acute heart failure.\n\n\n\n**Select****Third****Quarter****2024****Financial Results**\n\nFor the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported an operating loss of $4.7 million, which was comparable to an operating loss of $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. Included in our operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 is $2.2 million related to the change in fair value of our common stock warrant liability and $0.7 million in expenses related to the two private placements completed in July 2024 which were allocated to the warrants issued in those transactions and expensed immediately.\n\nResearch and development expenses were $2.0 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $2.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Research and development expenses for both periods primarily relate to the SEISMiC Extension trial of istaroxime for the treatment of early cardiogenic shock which completed enrollment during the third quarter of 2024.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $2.8 million, compared to $2.6 million for the third quarter of 2023. For the third quarter of 2024, general and administrative expenses include $0.7 million in expenses related to the two private placements completed in July 2024 which were allocated to the warrants issued in those transactions and expensed immediately.\n\nThe Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3.8 million ($4.23 per basic share) on 0.9 million weighted-average common shares outstanding for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $4.4 million ($15.47 per basic share) on 0.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding for the comparable period in 2023.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company reported cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 million and current liabilities of $14.4 million, which includes an $8.6 million warrant liability. Included in prepaid expenses and other assets as of September 30, 2024 is $0.7 million in receivables related to ELOC Purchase Agreement gross proceeds for sales made during the quarter for which we had not yet received the cash payment. The related net proceeds after the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock was $0.5 million. In addition, subsequent to September 30, 2024 and through November 22, 2024, we sold an additional 4.3 million shares of Common Stock under the ELOC Purchase Agreement for net proceeds of $2.4 million following mandatory redemption payments on our Series C Preferred Stock. Following these financings, we believe that we have sufficient resources available to fund our business operations through January 2025. \n\nReaders are referred to, and encouraged to read in its entirety, the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 26, 2024, and includes detailed discussions about the Company’s business plans and operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\n**Nasdaq Update**\n\nOn November 21, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (“Staff”) of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC stating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of it not having timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on the November 26, 2024 filing of the Company’s Form 10-Q and a subsequent letter received from Nasdaq on November 27, 2024 stating the Staff has determined that the Company complies with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), this matter is now closed.\n\n**About Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.**Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on advancing early and late-stage innovative therapies for critical conditions and diseases.

He served as a CEO of Black Elk Energy Offshore in 2014 as part of Nagel Avenue Capital which he joined after ten years on Wall Street with a variety of investment banking organizations and funds, including ING, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Securities.\n\n“I am excited to be joining Windtree full time as its CEO to create value and lead the company into the next stage of growth and progress,” said Mr. Latkin. “Istaroxime and the SERCA2a activator platform have delivered compelling clinical and preclinical results and represent a significant opportunity to create value and be important new therapies. Along with our early pipeline in the area of oncology and a very experienced team, the Company has the right ingredients to make 2025 and beyond very rewarding.”\n\n**About Istaroxime** Istaroxime is a first-in-class dual-mechanism therapy designed to improve both systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Istaroxime is a positive inotropic agent that increases myocardial contractility through inhibition of Na+/K+- ATPase with a complimentary mechanism that facilitates myocardial relaxation through activation of the SERCA2a calcium pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhancing calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm. Data from multiple Phase 2 studies in patients with early cardiogenic shock or acute decompensated heart failure demonstrate that istaroxime infused intravenously significantly improves cardiac function and blood pressure without increasing heart rate or the incidence of cardiac rhythm disturbances.\n\n**About Windtree Therapeutics, Inc.**Windtree Therapeutics, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on advancing early and late-stage innovative therapies for critical conditions and diseases. Windtree’s portfolio of product candidates includes istaroxime, a Phase II candidate with SERCA2a activating properties for acute heart failure and associated cardiogenic shock, preclinical SERCA2a activators for heart failure and preclinical precision aPKCi inhibitors that are being developed for potential in rare and broad oncology applications. Windtree also has a licensing business model with partnership out-licenses currently in place.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(“Windtree” or the “Company”) (NasdaqCM: WINT), a biotechnology company focused on advancing early and late-stage innovative therapies for critical conditions and diseases, today announced the issuance of an istaroxime patent for Hong Kong. The patent is entitled, “Istaroxime-containing intravenous formulation for the treatment of heart failure (AHF).” The claims are directed formulations comprising istaroxime, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and methods of use, alone, or in combination with other agents useful for the treatment and management of AHF. The application number is 62021023600.1. The Notice of Publication of the Registration and Grant has a date of October 9, 2024 and will expire in 2039. The patent for mainland China was granted earlier this year (patent number ZL201980003356.1).\n\nWindtree’s licensing partner, Lee’s Pharmaceutical (HK) Ltd. (“Lee’s”), is planning a Phase 3 program in acute heart failure for its Greater China territory. In alignment with the licensing agreement, Lee’s is funding all trials and development conducted in their region. Windtree is collaborating with Lee’s on the Phase 3 program and has final signing authority on the protocol. Acute heart failure is the #1 cause of hospitalization in patients >65 years of age in many regions of the world and as Windtree advances its cardiogenic shock program globally, Lee’s is progressing the acute heart failure intended indication.\n\nIstaroxime is a novel, first-in-class investigational therapy that is intended to improve systolic contraction and diastolic relaxation of the heart while also increasing blood pressure and maintaining renal function with a generally favorable safety profile. Istaroxime has been studied in four positive Phase 2 trials enrolling patients with acute heart failure and early cardiogenic shock due to heart failure.\n\n“Acute heart failure is responsible for millions of hospitalizations annually throughout the world and there is a high need for innovation in drug treatment,” said Craig Fraser, Chairman and CEO of Windtree. “Expansion of our patent estate helps support our Greater China regional licensing agreement with Lee’s, through which Windtree may receive up to $138 million in potential milestones and low double digit royalties. We will continue to support our partner with patent and other development work.”\n\n**About Istaroxime** Istaroxime is a first-in-class dual-mechanism therapy designed to improve both systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Istaroxime is designed as a positive inotropic agent that increases myocardial contractility through inhibition of Na+/K+- ATPase with a complimentary mechanism that facilitates myocardial relaxation through activation of the SERCA2a calcium pump on the sarcoplasmic reticulum enhancing calcium reuptake from the cytoplasm.

Windtree also has a licensing business model with partnership out-licenses currently in place.\n\n**Forward Looking Statements** This press release contains statements related to the potential clinical effects of istaroxime; the potential benefits and safety of istaroxime; the clinical development of istaroxime; and our research and development program for treating patients in early cardiogenic shock due to heart failure.
