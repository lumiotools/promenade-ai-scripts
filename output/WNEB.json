Reports Results for Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nOctober 23, 2024\n\nWESTFIELD, Mass., Oct. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Western New England Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company” or “WNEB”) (NasdaqGS: WNEB), the holding company for Westfield Bank (the “Bank”), announced today the unaudited results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $1.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. On a linked quarter basis, net income was $1.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $3.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income was $8.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to net income of $12.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company also announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend will be payable on or about November 21, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 7, 2024.\n\nJames C. Hagan, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We believe our Company continues to be well positioned with strong capital and access to various liquidity sources. Our financial performance has been largely impacted by the unprecedented interest rate cycle and higher funding costs in response to the sustained increase in interest rates over the last 18-24 months. While it remains unclear whether the recent decrease in interest rates represents an end to this trend, the balance sheet is positioned to benefit from this decrease and the challenge will begin to subside as our liabilities begin to reprice lower. As we continue to manage the balance sheet in this uncertain interest rate environment, we remain focused on expense management initiatives to mitigate top line pressures and improve efficiencies over the Company’s long-term. The Company also continues to focus on our core business to grow loans and deposits as well as retention of our customers. Total deposits increased $80.5 million, or 3.8%, and total loans increased $21.7 million, or 1.1%, from year-end. Our asset quality remains strong, with nonperforming loans to total loans of 0.24% at September 30, 2024.”\n\nHagan concluded, “The Company is considered to be well-capitalized as defined by the regulators and we remain disciplined in our capital management strategies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 714,282 shares of the Company’s common stock at an average price per share of $7.61. We continue to believe that buying back shares represents a prudent use of the Company’s capital and we are pleased to be able to continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchases. Although the banking environment has been challenged, our capital management strategies have been critical to sustaining growth in book value per share, which increased $0.44, or 4.0%, while tangible book value per share increased $0.43, or 4.2%, to $10.73. The management team remains focused and well positioned to serve our community and to enhance shareholder value over the long term.”\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n\n**Loans and Deposits**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total loans were $2.0 billion and increased $21.7 million, or 1.1%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in total loans was due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $3.0 million, or 0.3%, an increase in residential real estate loans, including home equity loans, of $26.4 million, or 3.7%, partially offset by a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of $7.0 million, or 3.2%.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total deposits were $2.2 billion and increased $80.5 million, or 3.8%, from December 31, 2023. Core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, decreased $8.3 million, or 0.5%, from $1.5 billion, or 71.5% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023, to $1.5 billion, or 68.5% of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Time deposits increased $88.8 million, or 14.5%, from $611.4 million at December 31, 2023 to $700.2 million at September 30, 2024. Brokered time deposits, which are included in time deposits, totaled $1.7 million at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. The loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 94.6% at December 31, 2023 to 92.1% at September 30, 2024.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company’s liquidity position remains strong with solid core deposit relationships, cash, unencumbered securities, a diversified deposit base and access to diversified borrowing sources. At September 30, 2024, the Company had $1.1 billion in immediately available liquidity, compared to $615.0 million in uninsured deposits, or 27.7% of total deposits, representing a coverage ratio of 183%. Uninsured deposits of the Bank’s customers are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance if the customer opens an IntraFi Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) account or a reciprocal time deposit through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry System (“CDARS”). IntraFi allows for up to $250.0 million per customer of pass-through FDIC insurance, which would more than cover each of the Bank’s deposit customers if such customer desired to have such pass-through insurance.\n\n**Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $20.0 million, or 0.97% of total loans and 409.5% of nonperforming loans, compared to $20.3 million, or 1.00% of total loans and 315.6% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans totaled $4.9 million, or 0.24% of total loans, compared to $6.4 million, or 0.32% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. Total delinquent loans decreased $1.7 million, or 28.3%, from $6.0 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at December 31, 2023 to $4.3 million, or 0.21% of total loans, at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any other real estate owned.\n\n**Net Interest Margin**\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.44% for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Stock Repurchase Program**\n\nOn June 10, 2024, the Company announced the completion of its previously authorized stock repurchase plan (the “2022 Plan”) pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1.1 million shares, or approximately 5% of its outstanding common stock, as of the date the 2022 Plan was adopted. On May 22, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan (the “2024 Plan”) under which the Company may repurchase up to 1.0 million shares, or approximately 4.6%, of the Company’s then-outstanding shares of common stock.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 244,441 shares of common stock under the 2024 Plan, with an average price per share of $8.18. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 714,282 shares of common stock with an average price per share of $7.61. As of September 30, 2024, there were 692,318 shares of common stock available for repurchase under the 2024 Plan.\n\nThe repurchase of shares under the stock repurchase program is administered through an independent broker. The shares of common stock repurchased under the 2024 Plan have been and will continue to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, depending upon market conditions. There is no guarantee as to the exact number, or value, of shares that will be repurchased by the Company, and the Company may discontinue repurchases at any time that the Company’s management (“Management”) determines additional repurchases are not warranted. The timing and amount of additional share repurchases under the 2024 Plan will depend on a number of factors, including the Company’s stock price performance, ongoing capital planning considerations, general market conditions, and applicable legal requirements.\n\n**Book Value and Tangible Book Value**\n\nThe Company’s book value per share was $11.40 at September 30, 2024 compared to $10.96 at December 31, 2023, while tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased $0.43, or 4.2%, from $10.30 at December 31, 2023 to $10.73 at September 30, 2024. See pages 19-21 for the related tangible book value calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Net Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024**\n\nThe Company reported net income of $1.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $3.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Net interest income increased $258,000, or 1.8%, the provision for credit losses increased $1.2 million, non-interest income decreased $693,000, or 18.1%, and non-interest expense increased $92,000, or 0.6%. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.29% and 3.19%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.55% and 6.03%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nOn a sequential quarter basis, net interest income, our primary driver of revenues, increased $258,000, or 1.8%, to $14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $14.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest income of $1.0 million, or 3.9%, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $780,000, or 6.3%.\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.44% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company had a fair value hedge which contributed to an increase in the net interest margin of seven basis points. Excluding the interest income attributed to the fair value hedge, the net interest margin was 2.33% and 2.35%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. The fair value hedge is scheduled to mature in October of 2024.\n\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.54% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.49% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The average loan yield, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.90% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.85% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets increased $40.6 million, or 1.7% to $2.4 billion, primarily due to an increase in average loans of $21.5 million, or 1.1%, an increase in average short-term investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, $17.7 million, or 123.6%, and an increase in average other investments of $1.6 million, or 11.0%.\n\nThe average cost of total funds, including non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased eight basis points from 2.16% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 to 2.24% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, increased six basis points to 0.93% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.87% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The average cost of time deposits increased five basis points from 4.39% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 to 4.44% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings, including subordinated debt, increased five basis points from 5.00% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 to 5.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, increased $10.4 million, or 1.9%, from $548.8 million, or 25.7% of total average deposits, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, to $559.2 million, or 25.7% of total average deposits, for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Provision for (Reversal of) Credit Losses**\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $941,000, compared to a reversal for credit losses of $294,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses includes a provision for credit losses on loans of $609,000 and a reserve on unfunded loan commitments of $332,000. The increase in the provision for credit losses on loans was due to changes in the economic environment and related adjustments to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology as well as growth in the loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management’s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s actions to control inflation. The increase in reserves on unfunded loan commitments was due to an increase in commercial real estate unfunded loan commitments of $33.5 million, or 20.7%, from $161.8 million at June 30, 2024 to $195.3 million at September 30, 2024. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment.\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $98,000, compared to net charge-offs of $10,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nOn a sequential quarter basis, non-interest income decreased $693,000, or 18.1%, to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Service charges and fees on deposits were $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024. Income from bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) decreased $32,000, or 6.4%, from the three months ended June 30, 2024 to $470,000, for the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported $74,000 in other income from loan-level swap fees on commercial loans and did not have comparable income during the three months ended June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold $20.1 million in fixed rate residential loans to the secondary market and reported income from mortgage banking activities of $246,000 and did not have comparable income during the three months ended June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized gains on marketable equity securities of $10,000 and $4,000, respectively. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported a gain on non-marketable equity investments of $987,000 and did not have comparable gains or losses from non-marketable equity investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Non-Interest Expense**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense increased $92,000, or 0.6%, to $14.4 million from $14.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Salaries and employee benefits increased $211,000, or 2.7%, to $8.1 million, software expenses increased $46,000, or 8.1%, data processing expense increased $23,000, or 2.7%, FDIC insurance expense increased $15,000, or 4.6%, and debit card and ATM processing fees increased $6,000, or 0.9%. During the same period, these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $41,000, or 7.1%, a decrease in advertising expense of $68,000, or 20.1%, a decrease in occupancy expense of $1,000, or 0.1%, and a decrease in other non-interest expense of $99,000, or 7.0%.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the efficiency ratio was 80.6%, compared to 78.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 80.7% compared to 82.7% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increases in the efficiency ratio and the adjusted efficiency ratio were driven by lower revenues, defined as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, during the three months ended September 30, 2024. See pages 19-21 for the related adjusted efficiency ratio calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Income Tax Provision**\n\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $618,000, or an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared to $771,000, or an effective tax rate of 18.0%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by the Company’s projections of pre-tax income for the year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n**Net Income for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023.**\n\nThe Company reported net income of $1.9 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest income decreased $1.7 million, or 10.1%, provision for credit losses increased $587,000, non-interest income decreased $471,000, or 13.0%, and non-interest expense increased $288,000, or 2.0%, during the same period. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.29% and 3.19%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.70% and 7.60%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nNet interest income decreased $1.7 million, or 10.1%, to $14.7 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $16.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense of $3.6 million, or 37.8%, partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income of $1.9 million, or 7.5%. Interest expense on deposits increased $3.5 million, or 44.9%, and interest expense on borrowings increased $133,000, or 7.3%. The increase in interest expense was a result of competitive pricing on deposits due to the continued higher interest rate environment and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits.\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.40% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.42% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.72% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits, which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a fair value hedge which contributed to an increase in the net interest margin of seven basis points. Excluding the interest income from the fair value hedge, the net interest margin was 2.33% and 2.64%, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value hedge is scheduled to mature in October of 2024.\n\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.54% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets increased $38.2 million, or 1.6% to $2.4 billion, primarily due to an increase in average loans of $31.3 million, or 1.6%, an increase in average short-term investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of $9.7 million, or 43.4%, an increase in average other investments of $3.7 million, or 30.8%, partially offset by a decrease in average securities of $6.5 million, or 1.8%.\n\nThe average cost of total funds, including non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased 60 basis points from 1.64% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.24% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, increased 23 basis points to 0.93% for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of time deposits increased 98 basis points from 3.46% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.44% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings, including subordinated debt, increased 24 basis points from 4.81% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 5.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, decreased $32.7 million, or 5.5%, from $591.9 million, or 27.5% of total average deposits, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to $559.2 million, or 25.7% of total average deposits, for the three months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $941,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of $354,000, during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio, specifically unfunded commercial real estate loan commitments, as well as changes in the economic environment and related adjustments to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology. The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management’s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment.\n\nThe Company recorded net charge-offs of $98,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net charge-offs of $78,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nNon-interest income decreased $471,000, or 13.0%, from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Service charges and fees on deposits increased $196,000, or 9.1%, and income from BOLI increased $16,000, or 3.5%, from the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Salaries and employee benefits increased $157,000, or 2.0%, to $8.1 million, debit card and ATM processing fees increased $87,000, or 15.5%, software expenses increased $83,000, or 15.7%, occupancy expense increased $58,000, or 5.0%, data processing expense increased $45,000, or 5.5%, other non-interest income increased $54,000, or 4.3%, and furniture and equipment related expenses increased $1,000, or 0.2%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional fees of $103,000, or 16.0%, a decrease in advertising expense of $91,000, or 25.1%, and a decrease in FDIC insurance expense of $3,000, or 0.9%.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the efficiency ratio was 80.6%, compared to 70.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 80.7% compared to 74.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the efficiency ratio and the non-GAAP adjusted efficiency ratio were driven by lower revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. See pages 19-21 for the related adjusted efficiency ratio calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Income Tax Provision**\n\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $618,000, or an effective tax rate of 24.5%, compared to $1.0 million, or an effective tax rate of 18.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included $778,000 in non-taxable BOLI death benefits.\n\n**Net Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $8.4 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $12.6 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.44% and 4.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.66% and 7.19% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased $7.2 million, or 13.9%, to $44.5 million, compared to $51.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to an increase in interest expense of $14.1 million, or 62.3%, partially offset by an increase in interest and dividend income of $6.9 million, or 9.3%. The $14.1 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $12.9 million, or 72.3%, in interest expense on deposits as a result of competitive pricing and an unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits.\n\nThe net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.46%, compared to 2.88% during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.48% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.90% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core to high cost time deposits, which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had a fair value hedge which contributed to an increase in the net interest margin of seven and three basis points, respectively. Excluding the interest income from the fair value hedge, the net interest margin was 2.39% and 2.85%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value hedge is scheduled to mature in October of 2024.\n\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.14% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average loan yield, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.86% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.49% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets increased $14.5 million, or 0.6%, to $2.4 billion, from the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average loans of $23.4 million, or 1.2%, an increase in average short-term investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of $5.7 million, or 44.2%, and an increase in other interest-earning assets of $1.7 million, or 13.7%, partially offset by a decrease in average securities of $16.3 million, or 4.4%.\n\nThe average cost of total funds, including non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased 80 basis points from 1.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 2.12% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, increased 24 basis points to 0.86% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 0.62% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of time deposits increased 160 basis points from 2.72% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.32% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The average cost of borrowings, including subordinated debt, increased 15 basis points from 4.84% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.99% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Average demand deposits, an interest-free source of funds, decreased $52.1 million, or 8.6%, from $607.3 million, or 28.0% of total average deposits, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to $555.3 million, or 25.8% of total average deposits, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses**\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $97,000, compared to a provision for credit losses of $386,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the loan mix as well as economic environment and related adjustments to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology. The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management’s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $41,000 compared to net charge-offs of $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were related to one commercial relationship acquired in October 2016 from Chicopee Bancorp, Inc. The Company recorded a $1.9 million charge-off on the relationship, which represented the non-accretable credit mark that was required to be grossed-up to the loan’s amortized cost basis with a corresponding increase to the allowance for credit losses under the CECL implementation.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income increased $1.5 million, or 17.9%, from $8.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to $9.6 million. Service charges and fees on deposits increased $328,000, or 5.0%, and income from BOLI increased $37,000, or 2.7%.\n\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a gain of $987,000 on non-marketable equity investments, compared to a gain of $590,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The Company did not have comparable income during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Non-Interest Expense**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest expense decreased $63,000, or 0.1%, to $43.5 million, compared to $43.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees of $513,000, or 23.3%, a decrease in salaries and employee benefits of $218,000, or 0.9%, a decrease in advertising expense of $159,000, or 14.2%, a decrease in other non-interest expense of $120,000, or 2.9%, and a decrease in furniture and equipment related expense of $10,000, or 0.7%. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in software related expenses of $309,000, or 19.7%, an increase in debit card and ATM processing fees of $264,000, or 16.7%, an increase in data processing of $208,000, or 8.8%, an increase in FDIC insurance expense of $88,000, or 9.0%, and an increase in occupancy expense of $88,000, or 2.4%.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the efficiency ratio was 80.3%, compared to 72.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 81.8% compared to 73.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in the efficiency ratio and the non-GAAP adjusted efficiency ratio were driven by lower revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. See pages 19-21 for the related adjusted efficiency ratio calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Income Tax Provision**\n\nIncome tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 20.9%, compared to $3.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 21.3%, for nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total assets were $2.6 billion, an increase of $75.9 million, or 3.0%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $44.0 million, or 152.4%, an increase in total loans of $21.7 million, or 1.1%, and an increase in investment securities of $8.7 million, or 2.4%.\n\n**Investments**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the investment securities portfolio totaled $369.4 million, or 14.0% of total assets, compared to $360.7 million, or 14.1%, of total assets, at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company’s available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities portfolio, recorded at fair market value, increased $18.8 million, or 13.7%, from $137.1 million at December 31, 2023 to $155.9 million. The held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities portfolio, recorded at amortized cost, decreased $10.1 million, or 4.5%, from $223.4 million at December 31, 2023 to $213.3 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nAt September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the AFS securities portfolio of $24.6 million, or 13.6% of the amortized cost basis of the AFS securities portfolio, compared to unrealized losses of $29.2 million, or 17.5% of the amortized cost basis of the AFS securities at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the HTM securities portfolio of $30.7 million, or 14.4%, of the amortized cost basis of the HTM securities portfolio, compared to $35.7 million, or 16.0% of the amortized cost basis of the HTM securities portfolio at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe securities in which the Company may invest are limited by regulation. Federally chartered savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, repurchase agreements, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments and marketable equity securities. The securities, with the exception of $4.6 million in corporate bonds, are issued by the United States government or government-sponsored enterprises and are therefore either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of contractual principal and interest. These positions are deemed to have no credit impairment, therefore, the disclosed unrealized losses with the securities portfolio relate primarily to changes in prevailing interest rates. In all cases, price improvement in future periods will be realized as the issuances approach maturity.\n\nManagement regularly reviews the portfolio for securities in an unrealized loss position. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record any credit impairment charges on its securities portfolio and attributed the unrealized losses primarily due to fluctuations in general interest rates or changes in expected prepayments and not due to credit quality. The primary objective of the Company’s investment portfolio is to provide liquidity and to secure municipal deposit accounts while preserving the safety of principal. The Company expects to strategically redeploy available cash flows from the securities portfolio to fund loan growth and deposit outflows.\n\n**Total Loans**\n\nTotal loans increased $21.7 million, or 1.1%, from December 31, 2023, to $2.0 billion at September 30, 2024. The increase in total loans was due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $3.0 million, or 0.3%, an increase in residential real estate loans, including home equity loans, of $26.4 million, or 3.7%, partially offset by a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of $7.0 million, or 3.2%. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold $20.1 million in fixed rate residential loans to the secondary market with servicing retained.\n\nThe following table presents the summary of the loan portfolio by the major classification of the loan at the periods indicated:\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nCommercial real estate loans:  \nNon-owner occupied| $| 878,265| $| 881,643  \nOwner-occupied| 204,524| 198,108  \nTotal commercial real estate loans| 1,082,789| 1,079,751  \nResidential real estate loans:  \nResidential| 631,649| 612,315  \nHome equity| 116,923| 109,839  \nTotal residential real estate loans| 748,572| 722,154  \nCommercial and industrial loans| 210,390| 217,447  \nConsumer loans| 4,631| 5,472  \n**Total gross loans**|  2,046,382| 2,024,824  \nUnamortized premiums and net deferred loans fees and costs| 2,620| 2,493  \n**Total loans**|  $| 2,049,002| $| 2,027,317  \n  \n**Credit Quality**\n\nManagement continues to closely monitor the loan portfolio for any signs of deterioration in borrowers’ financial condition and also in light of speculation that commercial real estate values may deteriorate as the market continues to adjust to higher vacancies and interest rates. We continue to proactively take steps to mitigate risk in our loan portfolio.\n\nTotal delinquency was $4.3 million, or 0.21% of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to $6.0 million, or 0.30% of total loans at December 31, 2023.

The Company continues to focus on the maintenance, development, and expansion of its core deposit base to meet funding requirements and liquidity needs, with an emphasis on retaining a long-term customer relationship base by competing for and retaining deposits in our local market. At September 30, 2024, the Bank’s uninsured deposits represented 27.7% of total deposits, compared to 26.8% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**FHLB and Subordinated Debt**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, total borrowings decreased $4.1 million, or 2.6%, from $156.5 million at December 31, 2023 to $152.4 million. Short-term borrowings decreased $11.7 million, or 72.7%, to $4.4 million, compared to $16.1 million at December 31, 2023. Long-term borrowings increased $7.6 million, or 6.3%, from $120.6 million at December 31, 2023 to $128.3 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowings also consisted of $19.7 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes.\n\nThe Company utilized the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”), which was created in March 2023 to enhance banking system liquidity by allowing institutions to pledge certain securities at par value and borrow at a rate of ten basis points over the one-year overnight index swap rate. The BTFP was available to federally insured depository institutions in the U.S., with advances having a term of up to one year with no prepayment penalties. The BTFP ceased extending new advances in March 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s outstanding balance under the BTFP was $90.0 million.

The change was primarily attributable to a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $3.4 million, cash dividends paid of $4.5 million, repurchase of shares at a cost of $5.6 million, partially offset by net income of $8.4 million. At September 30, 2024, total shares outstanding were 21,113,408.\n\nThe Company’s regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong and in excess of regulatory minimum requirements to be considered well-capitalized as defined by regulators and internal Company targets.

Reports Results for Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nJuly 23, 2024\n\nWESTFIELD, Mass., July 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Western New England Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company” or “WNEB”) (NasdaqGS: WNEB), the holding company for Westfield Bank (the “Bank”), announced today the unaudited results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $3.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2023. On a linked quarter basis, net income was $3.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $3.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, net income was $6.5 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net income of $8.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company also announced that the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend will be payable on or about August 21, 2024 to shareholders of record on August 7, 2024.\n\nJames C. Hagan, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “It has been widely publicized that the economy and the banking industry is in the midst of the longest inverted yield curve in U.S. history, which continues to create net interest margin compression and funding challenges for banks across the country, including Western New England Bancorp. We believe our Company continues to be well positioned with strong capital and access to liquidity to sustain us through this unprecedented interest rate cycle. Our quarterly financial performance has been largely impacted by higher funding costs in response to the sustained increase in interest rates over the last 18-24 months. As we continue to manage the balance sheet in this uncertain environment, we are also focused on expense management initiatives to mitigate top line pressures and improve efficiencies over the long-term. The Company also continues to focus on our loan and deposit growth initiatives and retention of our customers. Total deposits increased $28.1 million, or 1.3%, from year-end and our asset quality remains strong, with nonperforming loans to total loans of 0.29% at June 30, 2024.”\n\nHagan concluded, “The Company is considered to be well-capitalized as defined by the regulators and we remain disciplined in our capital management strategies. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 470,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at an average price per share of $7.32. We continue to believe that buying back shares represents a prudent use of the Company’s capital and we are pleased to be able to continue to return value to shareholders through share repurchases. On May 22, 2024, as previously announced, the Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase plan under which the Company may purchase up to 1.0 million shares, or approximately 4.6%, of the Company’s outstanding shares. We remain focused and well positioned to serve our community today and in the future and to enhance shareholder value.”\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n\n**Loans and Deposits**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, total loans were $2.0 billion and decreased $1.1 million, or 0.1%, from December 31, 2023. The decrease in total loans was due to a decrease in commercial real estate loans of $23.2 million, or 2.1%, a decrease in commercial and industrial loans of $1.1 million, or 0.5%, partially offset by an increase in residential real estate loans, including home equity loans, of $23.8 million, or 3.3%.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, total deposits were $2.2 billion and increased $28.1 million, or 1.3%, from December 31, 2023. Core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, decreased $32.3 million, or 2.1%, from $1.5 billion, or 71.5% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023, to $1.5 billion, or 69.1% of total deposits at June 30, 2024. The loan-to-deposit ratio decreased from 94.6% at December 31, 2023 to 93.3% at June 30, 2024.\n\n**Liquidity**\n\nThe Company’s liquidity position remains strong with solid core deposit relationships, cash, unencumbered securities, a diversified deposit base and access to diversified borrowing sources. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $1.1 billion in immediately available liquidity, compared to $574.4 million in uninsured deposits, or 26.4% of total deposits, representing a coverage ratio of 186%. Uninsured deposits of the Bank’s customers are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance if the customer opens an IntraFi Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) account or a reciprocal time deposit through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry System (“CDARS”). IntraFi allows for up to $250.0 million per customer of pass-through FDIC insurance, which would more than cover each of the Bank’s deposit customers if such customer desired to have such pass-through insurance.\n\n**Allowance for Loan Losses and Credit Quality**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was $19.4 million, or 0.96% of total loans and 332.7% of nonperforming loans, compared to $20.3 million, or 1.00% of total loans and 315.6% of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, nonperforming loans totaled $5.8 million, or 0.29% of total loans, compared to $6.4 million, or 0.32% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. Total delinquent loans decreased $449,000, or 7.4%, from $6.0 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at December 31, 2023 to $5.6 million, or 0.27% of total loans, at June 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any other real estate owned.\n\n**Net Interest Margin**\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.42% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to 2.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.44% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Stock Repurchase Program**\n\nOn June 10, 2024, the Company announced the completion of its previously authorized stock repurchase plan (the “2022 Plan”) pursuant to which the Company was authorized to repurchase up to 1.1 million shares, or approximately 5% of its outstanding common stock, as of the date the 2022 Plan was adopted. On May 22, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase plan (the “2024 Plan”) under which the Company may repurchase up to 1.0 million shares, or approximately 4.6%, of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 206,600 shares of common stock under the 2022 Plan, with an average price per share of $6.64 and 63,241 shares of common stock under the 2024 Plan, with an average price per share of $6.57. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 469,841 shares of common stock with an average price per share of $7.32. As of June 30, 2024, there were 936,759 shares of common stock available for repurchase under the 2024 Plan.\n\nThe table below breaks out the shares repurchased under the 2022 Plan and 2024 Plan for the period noted:\n\n**Shares Repurchased**| **Price per Share**| **Shares Available Under Plan(s)**  \n---|---|---  \n**Three months ended March 31, 2024:**  \n2022 Plan| 200,000| $| 8.26| 206,600  \n**Three months ended June 30, 2024:**  \n2022 Plan| 206,600| $| 6.64| -  \n2024 Plan| 63,241| 6.57| 936,759  \n**Total**|  269,841| $| 6.62| 936,759  \n**Total for the six months ended June 30, 2024:**|  469,841| $| 7.32| 936,759  \n  \nThe repurchase of shares under the stock repurchase program is administered through an independent broker. The shares of common stock repurchased under the 2024 Plan have been and will continue to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market or privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, depending upon market conditions. There is no guarantee as to the exact number, or value, of shares that will be repurchased by the Company, and the Company may discontinue repurchases at any time that the Company’s management (“Management”) determines additional repurchases are not warranted. The timing and amount of additional share repurchases under the 2024 Plan will depend on a number of factors, including the Company’s stock price performance, ongoing capital planning considerations, general market conditions, and applicable legal requirements.\n\n**Book Value and Tangible Book Value**\n\nThe Company’s book value per share was $11.07 at June 30, 2024 compared to $10.96 at December 31, 2023, while tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, increased $0.11, or 1.1%, from $10.30 at December 31, 2023 to $10.41 at June 30, 2024. See pages 18-20 for the related tangible book value calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Net Income for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2024**\n\nThe Company reported net income of $3.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $3.0 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Net interest income decreased $876,000, or 5.7%, the reversal of credit losses decreased $256,000, or 46.5%, non-interest income increased $1.2 million, or 43.4%, and non-interest expense decreased $468,000, or 3.2%. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.55% and 6.03%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 0.47% and 5.04%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin**\n\nOn a sequential quarter basis, net interest income, our primary driver of revenues, decreased $876,000, or 5.7%, to $14.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from $15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $1.1 million, or 9.5%, partially offset by an increase in interest income of $198,000, or 0.7%. The increase in interest expense was a result of competitive pricing on deposits due to the continued high interest rate environment and the unfavorable shift in the deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits.\n\nThe net interest margin was 2.42%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.57% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The net interest margin, on a tax-equivalent basis, was 2.44% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.59% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, which was partially offset by an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets.\n\nThe average yield on interest-earning assets, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.49% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 4.45% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

During the three months ended June 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets decreased $2.5 million, or 0.1% to $2.4 billion, primarily due to an decrease in average loans of $4.6 million, or 0.2% and a decrease in average securities of $4.6 million, or 1.3%, partially offset by an increase in short-term investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of $4.9 million, or 52.7%, and an increase in average other investments of $1.8 million, or 14.7%.\n\nThe average cost of total funds, including non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased 19 basis points from 1.97% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 to 2.16% for the three months ended June 30, 2024. The average cost of core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, increased 11 basis points to 0.87% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 0.76% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

The provision for credit losses includes a $430,000 reversal of credit losses on loans and a $136,000 provision for unfunded commitments, primarily due to the impact of increased unfunded loan commitments. Total unfunded loan commitments increased $11.9 million, or 7.9%, to $161.8 million at June 30, 2024 from $149.9 million at March 31, 2024. The increase was primarily due to changes in the economic environment and related adjustments to the quantitative components of the CECL methodology. The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management’s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment.\n\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $10,000, compared to net recoveries of $67,000, for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nOn a sequential quarter basis, non-interest income increased $1.2 million, or 43.4%, to $3.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from $2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

The decrease in the efficiency ratio was driven by the gain on non-marketable equity investments of $987,000 recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the adjusted efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, was 82.7% compared to 82.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase in the non-GAAP efficiency ratio was driven by lower revenues, defined as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, during the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024. See pages 18-20 for the related ratio calculation and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n**Income Tax Provision**\n\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was $771,000, or an effective tax rate of 18.0%, compared to $827,000, or an effective tax rate of 21.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\n**Net Income for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2023.**\n\nThe Company reported net income of $3.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.

The average loan yield, without the impact of tax-equivalent adjustments, was 4.85% for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 4.49% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, average interest-earning assets decreased $4.4 million, or 0.2% to $2.4 billion, primarily due to a decrease in average securities of $19.7 million, or 5.3%, partially offset by an increase in average loans of $10.2 million, or 0.5%, an increase in short-term investments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of $4.0 million, or 38.8%, and an increase in average other investments of $1.0 million, or 7.5%.\n\nThe average cost of total funds, including non-interest bearing accounts and borrowings, increased 77 basis points from 1.39% for the three months ended June 30, 2023 to 2.16% for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

The provision for credit losses was determined by a number of factors: the continued strong credit performance of the Company’s loan portfolio, changes in the loan portfolio mix and Management’s consideration of existing economic conditions and the economic outlook from the Federal Reserve’s actions to control inflation. Management continues to monitor macroeconomic variables related to increasing interest rates, inflation and the concerns of an economic downturn, and believes it is appropriately reserved for the current economic environment.\n\nThe Company recorded net recoveries of $57,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net charge-offs of $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.\n\n**Non-Interest Income**\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, 2024, non-interest income increased $1.9 million, or 42.4%, from $4.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2023 to $6.5 million.

The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of $24.6 million, or 85.4%, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of $7.7 million, or 2.1%, and a decrease in total loans of $1.1 million, or 0.1%.\n\n**Investments**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, the investment securities portfolio totaled $353.0 million, or 13.6% of total assets, compared to $360.7 million, or 14.1%, of total assets, at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, the Company’s available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities portfolio, recorded at fair market value, decreased $2.0 million, or 1.5%, from $137.1 million at December 31, 2023 to $135.1 million. The held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities portfolio, recorded at amortized cost, decreased $5.8 million, or 2.6%, from $223.4 million at December 31, 2023 to $217.6 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the AFS securities portfolio of $31.7 million, or 19.0% of the amortized cost basis of the AFS securities portfolio, compared to unrealized losses of $29.2 million, or 17.5% of the amortized cost basis of the AFS securities at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, the Company reported unrealized losses on the HTM securities portfolio of $40.2 million, or 18.5%, of the amortized cost basis of the HTM securities portfolio, compared to $35.7 million, or 16.0% of the amortized cost basis of the HTM securities portfolio at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe securities in which the Company may invest are limited by regulation. Federally chartered savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, repurchase agreements, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments and marketable equity securities. The securities, with the exception of $4.3 million in corporate bonds, are issued by the United States government or government-sponsored enterprises and are therefore either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed as to the timely payment of contractual principal and interest. These positions are deemed to have no credit impairment, therefore, the disclosed unrealized losses with the securities portfolio relate primarily to changes in prevailing interest rates. In all cases, price improvement in future periods will be realized as the issuances approach maturity.\n\nManagement regularly reviews the portfolio for securities in an unrealized loss position. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not record any credit impairment charges on its securities portfolio and attributed the unrealized losses primarily due to fluctuations in general interest rates or changes in expected prepayments and not due to credit quality. The primary objective of the Company’s investment portfolio is to provide liquidity and to secure municipal deposit accounts while preserving the safety of principal. The Company expects to strategically redeploy available cash flows from the securities portfolio to fund loan growth and deposit outflows.\n\n**Total Loans**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, total loans decreased $1.1 million, or 0.1%, from December 31, 2023, to $2.0 billion. Commercial real estate loans decreased $23.2 million, or 2.1%, commercial and industrial loans decreased $1.1 million, or 0.5%, while residential real estate loans, including home equity loans, increased $23.8 million, or 3.3%.\n\nThe following table presents the summary of the loan portfolio by the major classification of the loan at the periods indicated:\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \nCommercial real estate loans:  \nNon-owner occupied| $| 864,603| $| 881,643  \nOwner-occupied| 191,936| 198,108  \nTotal commercial real estate loans| 1,056,539| 1,079,751  \nResidential real estate loans:  \nResidential| 631,997| 612,315  \nHome equity| 113,970| 109,839  \nTotal residential real estate loans| 745,967| 722,154  \nCommercial and industrial loans| 216,300| 217,447  \nConsumer loans| 4,715| 5,472  \n**Total gross loans**|  2,023,521| 2,024,824  \nUnamortized premiums and net deferred loans fees and costs| 2,705| 2,493  \n**Total loans**|  $| 2,026,226| $| 2,027,317  \n  \n**Credit Quality**\n\nManagement continues to closely monitor the loan portfolio for any signs of deterioration in borrowers’ financial condition and also in light of speculation that commercial real estate values may deteriorate as the market continues to adjust to higher vacancies and interest rates. We continue to proactively take steps to mitigate risk in our loan portfolio.\n\nTotal delinquency was $5.6 million, or 0.27% of total loans, at June 30, 2024, compared to $6.0 million, or 0.30% of total loans at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, nonperforming loans totaled $5.8 million, or 0.29% of total loans, compared to $6.4 million, or 0.32% of total loans, at December 31, 2023. Total nonperforming assets totaled $5.8 million, or 0.23% of total assets, at June 30, 2024, compared to $6.4 million, or 0.25% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any other real estate owned.\n\nAt June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.96%, compared to 1.00% at December 31, 2023. At June 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 332.7%, compared to 315.6% at December 31, 2023.\n\nTotal classified loans, defined as special mention and substandard loans, decreased $2.8 million, or 7.1%, from $39.5 million, or 1.9% of total loans, at December 31, 2023 to $36.7 million, or 1.8%, of total loans at June 30, 2024. We continue to maintain diversity among property types and within our geographic footprint. More details on the diversification of the loan portfolio are available in the supplementary earnings presentation.\n\n**Deposits**\n\nTotal deposits increased $28.1 million, or 1.3%, from $2.1 billion at December 31, 2023 to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2024. Core deposits, which the Company defines as all deposits except time deposits, decreased $32.3 million, or 2.1%, from $1.5 billion, or 71.5% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023, to $1.5 billion, or 69.1% of total deposits, at June 30, 2024. Non-interest-bearing deposits decreased $26.3 million, or 4.5%, to $553.3 million, money market accounts decreased $22.9 million, or 3.6%, to $611.5 million, savings accounts decreased $1.2 million, or 0.7%, to $186.2 million and interest-bearing checking accounts increased $18.1 million, or 13.8%, to $149.1 million. Time deposits increased $60.3 million, or 9.9%, from $611.4 million at December 31, 2023 to $671.7 million at June 30, 2024. Brokered time deposits, which are included in time deposits, totaled $1.7 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n\nThe table below is a summary of our deposit balances for the periods noted:\n\n**June 30, 2024**| **March 31, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n(Dollars in thousands)  \n**Core Deposits:**  \nDemand accounts| $| 553,329| $| 559,928| $| 579,595  \nInterest-bearing accounts| 149,100| 125,377| 131,031  \nSavings accounts| 186,171| 190,732| 187,405  \nMoney market accounts| 611,501| 624,474| 634,361  \n**Total Core Deposits**|  $| 1,500,101| $| 1,500,511| $| 1,532,392  \nTime Deposits:| 671,708| 643,236| 611,352  \n**Total Deposits:**|  $| 2,171,809| $| 2,143,747| $| 2,143,744  \n  \nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company continued to experience an unfavorable shift in deposit mix from low cost core deposits to high cost time deposits as customers continue to migrate to higher deposit rates. The Company continues to focus on the maintenance, development, and expansion of its core deposit base to meet funding requirements and liquidity needs, with an emphasis on retaining a long-term customer relationship base by competing for and retaining deposits in our local market. At June 30, 2024, the Bank’s uninsured deposits represented 26.4% of total deposits, compared to 26.8% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**FHLB and Subordinated Debt**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, total borrowings decreased $1.9 million, or 1.2%, from $156.5 million at December 31, 2023 to $154.6 million. Short-term borrowings decreased $9.5 million, or 59.2%, to $6.6 million, compared to $16.1 million at December 31, 2023. Long-term borrowings increased $7.7 million, or 6.3%, from $120.6 million at December 31, 2023 to $128.3 million at June 30, 2024.\n\nThe Company utilized the Bank Term Funding Program (“BTFP”), which was created in March 2023 to enhance banking system liquidity by allowing institutions to pledge certain securities at par value and borrow at a rate of ten basis points over the one-year overnight index swap rate. The BTFP was available to federally insured depository institutions in the U.S., with advances having a term of up to one year with no prepayment penalties. The BTFP ceased extending new advances in March 2024. At December 31, 2023, the Company’s outstanding balance under the BTFP was $90.0 million. There were no outstanding balance under the BTFP at June 30, 2024.\n\nAt June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, borrowings also consisted of $19.7 million in fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $437.4 million of additional borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank, $403.8 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Federal Reserve Bank Discount Window and $25.0 million of other unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks.\n\n**Capital**\n\nAt June 30, 2024, shareholders’ equity was $236.5 million, or 9.1% of total assets, compared to $237.4 million, or 9.3% of total assets, at December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1.9 million, cash dividends paid of $3.0 million, repurchase of shares at a cost of $3.6 million, partially offset by net income of $6.5 million. At June 30, 2024, total shares outstanding were 21,357,849.\n\nThe Company’s regulatory capital ratios continue to be strong and in excess of regulatory minimum requirements to be considered well-capitalized as defined by regulators and internal Company targets. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio was 14.7% at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio to adjusted average assets was 9.78% at June 30, 2024 and 9.62% at December 31, 2023.\n\n**Dividends**\n\nAlthough the Company has historically paid quarterly dividends on its common stock and currently intends to continue to pay such dividends, the Company’s ability to pay such dividends depends on a number of factors, including restrictions under federal laws and regulations on the Company’s ability to pay dividends, and as a result, there can be no assurance that dividends will continue to be paid in the future.\n\n**About Western New England Bancorp, Inc.**\n\nWestern New England Bancorp, Inc. is a Massachusetts-chartered stock holding company and the parent company of Westfield Bank, CSB Colts, Inc., Elm Street Securities Corporation, WFD Securities, Inc. and WB Real Estate Holdings, LLC.
