Gulf Wind Technology dramatically reduced the design and fabrication cycle for wind tunnel models. What previously took 30 to 40 days to iterate and finalize a design can now be completed in just 3 to 4 days. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nBy adopting Stratasys Neo® stereolithography (SLA) technology, Gulf Wind Technology has dramatically reduced the design and fabrication cycle for wind tunnel models. What previously took 30 to 40 days to iterate and finalize a design can now be completed in just 3 to 4 days. The technology also allows for specialized features such as pressure taps for real-time airflow data, which are difficult or impossible to execute with conventional manufacturing methods. \n\n“By leveraging the Stratasys Neo® SLA system we can generate far more data in a shorter time. This has enabled us to run our design process with more rigor, become more efficient, and take on business that we previously had to turn away,” said James Martin, CEO of Gulf Wind Technology. “Additive manufacturing allows our engineers to design internal structures, and pressure taps directly into our test models, which we couldn’t achieve with traditional methods.” \n\nRich Garrity, Chief Business Unit Officer at Stratasys, added, “Our work with Gulf Wind Technology demonstrates how manufacturers are adopting additive manufacturing where it makes the most sense for their business. By leveraging its unique advantages, Gulf Wind Technology can rapidly prototype and test complex designs, greatly improving their efficiency and ability to innovate. This is a perfect example of how 3D printing is expanding its place on the manufacturing floor alongside traditional methods.” \n\nThe technical capabilities of 3D printing have been essential to Gulf Wind Technology’s rotor design process. Using Stratasys Neo® SLA technology, Gulf Wind Technology can produce models with Somos® PerFORM Reflect™ material, which offers high strength, stiffness, and temperature resistance – critical attributes for wind tunnel testing. Due to the superior attributes of the resin, the printed parts post process and handling is simple and straight forward – from removal of support materials, to cleaning resin from internal channels to placement in a wind tunnel. \n\nInspired by the use of 3D printing in Formula 1 racing, Gulf Wind Technology’s engineers recognized the potential for rapid iteration and optimization in wind turbine design. With Stratasys' solutions, Gulf Wind Technology can test airfoil shapes and rotor designs faster than ever, allowing them to maximize wind energy efficiency for applications in the Gulf of Mexico. \n\n**About Stratasys**\n\nStratasys is leading the global shift to additive manufacturing with innovative 3D printing solutions for industries such as aerospace, automotive, consumer products, and healthcare.

(Nasdaq: SSYS) (“Stratasys” or the “Company”), a leader in polymer 3D printing solutions, today announced financial results for the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results Compared to Third Quarter 2023:**\n\n  * Revenue of $140.0 million, compared to $162.1 million, reflects ongoing impacts from current macroeconomic environment on customer capital equipment spending. \n  * GAAP gross margin of 44.8%, compared to 40.5% and non-GAAP gross margin of 49.6%, compared to 48.3%. \n  * GAAP operating loss of $25.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $42.8 million. \n  * Non-GAAP operating loss of $0.1 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $4.1 million. \n  * GAAP net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $47.3 million, or $0.68 per diluted share. \n  * Non-GAAP net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $2.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million, compared to $9.8 million. \n  * Cash used in operating activities of $4.5 million, compared to $12.7 million. \n\n\n\nDr. Yoav Zeif, Stratasys’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our decisive actions to realign our business with current market realities are starting to yield results. We have successfully begun to transform the company through cost optimization and by focusing on higher-growth opportunities. Our flagship F3300 platform is gaining significant traction in the marketplace, while our expansion into our key target industries of Aerospace, Automotive and Healthcare continues to expand. Most importantly, we returned to non-GAAP profitability in the third quarter, overcoming ongoing revenue pressures, further demonstrating the effective execution of our business plan by our entire team.” \n\nDr. Zeif continued, “The fundamental strength of our business is evident in our improved margins and continued robust balance sheet. Our recurring revenue from Consumables continues to grow, particularly in FDM technology utilization for manufacturing purposes, partially offsetting hardware sales that remain impacted by macro conditions. This validates both our recurring revenue model and our customers' accelerating shift from prototyping to manufacturing applications. With our restructuring plan ahead of schedule and on track to deliver $40 million in annual cost savings starting in the first quarter of next year, we are well-positioned to deliver increased revenue growth, profitability and cash flow in 2025, to address the pent-up demand once market conditions improve.\" \n\n**2024 Financial Outlook:**\n\nBased on current market conditions and assuming that the impacts of global inflationary pressures, relatively high interest rates and supply chain costs do not impede economic activity further, the Company is maintaining its revenue outlook and raising its margins and profitability outlook for 2024 as follows: \n\n  * Revenue of $570 million to $580 million. \n  * Non-GAAP gross margins between 49.0% to 49.2%. \n  * Operating expenses in the range of $276 million to $278 million. \n  * Non-GAAP operating margins to range between 0.6% to 1.3%. \n  * GAAP net loss of $105 million to $90 million, or ($1.48) to ($1.27) per diluted share. \n    * Includes one-time extraordinary costs associated with Stratasys’ strategic alternatives process. \n  * Non-GAAP net income of $2.1 to $5.0 million, or $0.03 to $0.07. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $25 million to $28 million. \n  * Capital expenditures of $15 million to $20 million. \n\n\n\nNon-GAAP earnings guidance excludes $30 million to $32 million of share-based compensation expense, $25 million to $27 million of projected amortization of intangible assets, and reorganization and other expenses of $39 million to $45 million. Non-GAAP guidance includes tax adjustments of $2 million to $3 million on the above non-GAAP items. \n\nAppropriate reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are provided in a table at the end of our press release and slide presentation, with itemized detail concerning the non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Stratasys Ltd.

These forward-looking statements are based on current information that is, by its nature, subject to rapid and even abrupt change. Due to risks and uncertainties associated with Stratasys' business, actual results could differ materially from those projected or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the degree of our success at introducing new or improved products and solutions that gain market share; the degree of growth of the 3D printing market generally; the impact of potential shifts in the prices or margins of the products that we sell or services that we provide, including due to a shift towards lower margin products or services; the impact of competition and new technologies; potential further charges against earnings that we could be required to take due to impairment of additional goodwill or other intangible assets; the extent of our success at successfully consummating and integrating into our existing business acquisitions or investments in new businesses, technologies, products or services; the global macro-economic environment, including headwinds caused by inflation, relatively high interest rates, unfavorable currency exchange rates and other growth-inhibiting conditions; potential changes in our management and board of directors; global market, political and economic conditions, and in the countries in which we operate in particular; costs and potential liability relating to litigation and regulatory proceedings; risks related to infringement of our intellectual property rights by others or infringement of others' intellectual property rights by us; the extent of our success at maintaining our liquidity and financing our operations and capital needs; the impact of tax regulations on our results of operations and financial condition; and those additional factors referred to in Item 3.D “Key Information - Risk Factors”, Item 4, “Information on the Company”, Item 5, “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,” and all other parts of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023, which we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 11, 2024 (the “2023 Annual Report”). Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made throughout our 2023 Annual Report and the Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 6-K that attaches Stratasys’ unaudited, condensed consolidated financial statements and its review of its results of operations and financial condition, for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024, which will be furnished to the SEC on or about November 13, 2024, and our other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, which are designed to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Any guidance provided, and other forward-looking statements made, in this press release are provided or made (as applicable) as of the date hereof, and Stratasys undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. \n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe non-GAAP data included herein, which excludes certain items as described below, are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful information for investors and shareholders of our company in gauging our results of operations (i) on an ongoing basis after excluding mergers, acquisitions, divestments and strategic process-related expense or gains and reorganization-related charges or gains, and legal provisions and (ii) excluding non-cash items such as share-based compensation expenses, acquired intangible assets amortization, including intangible assets amortization related to equity-method investments, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, revaluation of our investments and the corresponding tax effect of those items. These non-GAAP adjustments either do not reflect actual cash outlays that impact our liquidity and our financial condition or have a non-recurring impact on the statement of operations, as assessed by management. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our performance for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The limitations of using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of our results of operations without including all items indicated above during a period, which may not provide a view of our performance that is comparable to those of other companies in our industry. Investors and other readers should consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in a table below. \n\n**Stratasys Ltd.**  \n---  \n**Consolidated Balance Sheets**  \n(in thousands, except share data)  \n**September 30, 2024** | **December 31, 2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \n**Current assets**  \nCash and cash equivalents |  $  |  63,956  |  $  |  82,585   \nShort-term bank deposits |  80,000  |  80,000   \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $2,599 and $1,449 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively |  153,653  |  172,009   \nInventories |  195,188  |  192,976   \nPrepaid expenses |  8,522  |  7,929   \nOther current assets |  18,025  |  24,596   \n**Total current assets** |  519,344  |  560,095   \n**Non-current assets**  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net |  183,969  |  197,552   \nGoodwill |  100,086  |  100,051   \nOther intangible assets, net |  111,883  |  127,781   \nOperating lease right-of-use assets |  32,591  |  18,895   \nLong-term investments |  120,070  |  115,083   \nOther non-current assets |  14,734  |  14,448   \n**Total non-current assets** |  563,333  |  573,810   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  1,082,677  |  $  |  1,133,905   \n**LIABILITIES AND EQUITY**  \n**Current liabilities**  \nAccounts payable |  $  |  48,157  |  $  |  46,785   \nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities |  35,328  |  36,656   \nAccrued compensation and related benefits |  29,428  |  33,877   \nDeferred revenues - short-term |  49,788  |  52,610   \nOperating lease liabilities - short-term |  6,714  |  6,498   \n**Total current liabilities** |  169,415  |  176,426   \n**Non-current liabilities**  \nDeferred revenues - long-term |  19,109  |  23,655   \nDeferred income taxes - long-term |  574  |  723   \nOperating lease liabilities - long-term |  25,420  |  12,162   \nContingent consideration - long-term |  12,410  |  11,900   \nOther non-current liabilities |  23,971  |  24,200   \n**Total non-current liabilities** |  81,484  |  72,640   \n**Total liabilities** |  $  |  250,899  |  $  |  249,066   \nContingencies (see note 12)  \n**Equity**  \nOrdinary shares, NIS 0.01 nominal value, authorized 180,000 shares;

(Nasdaq: SSYS)\n(“Stratasys” or the “Company”), a leader in polymer 3D printing solutions, today announced\nfinancial results for the third quarter of 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Financial Results Compared to Third Quarter 2023:\nRevenue of $140.0 million, compared to $162.1 million, reflects ongoing impacts from\ncurrent macroeconomic environment on customer capital equipment spending.\nGAAP gross margin of 44.8%, compared to 40.5% and non-GAAP gross margin of\n49.6%, compared to 48.3%.\nGAAP operating loss of $25.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $42.8 million.\nNon-GAAP operating loss of $0.1 million, compared to non-GAAP operating income of\n$4.1 million.\nGAAP net loss of $26.6 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of\n$47.3 million, or $0.68 per diluted share.\nNon-GAAP net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to non-\nGAAP net income of $2.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $5.1 million, compared to $9.8 million.\nCash used in operating activities of $4.5 million, compared to $12.7 million.\nDr. Yoav Zeif, Stratasys’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Our decisive actions to realign our\nbusiness with current market realities are starting to yield results. We have successfully\nbegun to transform the company through cost optimization and by focusing on higher-growth\nopportunities. Our flagship F3300 platform is gaining significant traction in the marketplace,\nwhile our expansion into our key target industries of Aerospace, Automotive and Healthcare\ncontinues to expand. Most importantly, we returned to non-GAAP profitability in the third\nquarter, overcoming ongoing revenue pressures, further demonstrating the effective\nexecution of our business plan by our entire team.”\nDr. Zeif continued, “The fundamental strength of our business is evident in our improved\nmargins and continued robust balance sheet. Our recurring revenue from Consumables\ncontinues to grow, particularly in FDM technology utilization for manufacturing purposes,\npartially offsetting hardware sales that remain impacted by macro conditions. This validates\nboth our recurring revenue model and our customers' accelerating shift from prototyping to\nmanufacturing applications. With our restructuring plan ahead of schedule and on track to\ndeliver $40 million in annual cost savings starting in the first quarter of next year, we are\nwell-positioned to deliver increased revenue growth, profitability and cash flow in 2025, to\naddress the pent-up demand once market conditions improve.\"\n2024 Financial Outlook:\nBased on current market conditions and assuming that the impacts of global inflationary\npressures, relatively high interest rates and supply chain costs do not impede economic\nactivity further, the Company is maintaining its revenue outlook and raising its margins and\nprofitability outlook for 2024 as follows:\nRevenue of $570 million to $580 million.\nNon-GAAP gross margins between 49.0% to 49.2%.\nOperating expenses in the range of $276 million to $278 million.\nNon-GAAP operating margins to range between 0.6% to 1.3%.\nGAAP net loss of $105 million to $90 million, or ($1.48) to ($1.27) per diluted share.\nIncludes one-time extraordinary costs associated with Stratasys’ strategic\nalternatives process.\nNon-GAAP net income of $2.1 to $5.0 million, or $0.03 to $0.07.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $25 million to $28 million.\nCapital expenditures of $15 million to $20 million.\nNon-GAAP earnings guidance excludes $30 million to $32 million of share-based\ncompensation expense, $25 million to $27 million of projected amortization of intangible\nassets, and reorganization and other expenses of $39 million to $45 million. Non-GAAP\nguidance includes tax adjustments of $2 million to $3 million on the above non-GAAP items.\nAppropriate reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are provided\nin a table at the end of our press release and slide presentation, with itemized detail\nconcerning the non-GAAP financial measures.\nStratasys Ltd.

Forward-\nlooking statements are often characterized by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “continue,”\n“believe,” “should,” “intend,” “project” or other similar words, but are not the only way these statements are identified.\nThese forward-looking statements may include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives, plans and strategies, statements that contain\nprojections of results of operations or of financial condition and all statements (other than statements of historical facts) that address activities, events or\ndevelopments that we intend, expect, project, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We have based these forward-looking\nstatements on assumptions and assessments made by our management in light of their experience and their perception of historical trends, current conditions,\nexpected future developments and other factors they believe to be appropriate.\nImportant factors that could cause actual results, developments and business decisions to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking\nstatements include, among other things:\n• the extent of our success at introducing new or improved products and solutions that gain market share;\n• the extent of growth of the 3D printing market generally;\n• the global macro-economic environment, including headwinds caused by inflation, relatively high interest rates, potentially unfavorable currency exchange\nrates and uncertain economic conditions;\n• changes in our overall strategy, including as related to any restructuring activities and our capital expenditures;\n• the impact of shifts in prices or margins of the products that we sell or services we provide, including due to a shift towards lower margin products or\nservices;\n• the impact of competition and new technologies;\n• the outcome of our board of directors’ comprehensive process to explore strategic alternatives for our company;\n• impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in respect of companies that we acquire;\n• the extent of our success at efficiently and successfully integrating the operations of various companies that we have acquired or may acquire;\n• the degree of our success at locating and acquiring additional value-enhancing, inorganic technology that furthers our business plan to lead in the realm of\npolymers;\n• the potential adverse impact that recent global interruptions and delays involving freight carriers and other third parties may have on our supply chain and\ndistribution network and consequently, our ability to successfully sell both our existing and newly-launched 3D printing products;\n• global market, political and economic conditions, and in the countries in which we operate in particular;\n• the degree to which our company’s operations remain resistant to potential adverse effects of Israel’s war against the terrorist organization Hamas;\n• government regulations and approvals;\n• litigation and regulatory proceedings;\n• infringement of our intellectual property rights by others (including for replication and sale of consumables for use in our systems), or infringement of\nothers’ intellectual property rights by us;\n• potential cyber attacks against, or other breaches to, our information technologies systems;\n• the extent of our success at maintaining our liquidity and financing our operations and capital needs;\n• impact of tax regulations on our results of operations and financial condition; and\n• any additional factors referred to in Item 3.D “Key Information - Risk Factors”, Item 4 “Information on the Company”, and Item 5 “Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects”, as well as in other parts of this Annual report.\nReaders are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made throughout this annual report, which are designed to advise interested parties of\nthe risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAny forward-looking statements in this annual report are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-\nlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nUSE OF TRADE NAMES\nUnless the context otherwise indicates or requires, \"Stratasys\", \"PolyJet\", \"J8 Series\", \"J850\", \"J55\", \"J35\", \"Vero\", \"TrueDent\", \"FDM\", \"Fortus\", \"F900\", \"F370\",\n\"Fortus 450mc\", \"F123 Series\", \"F770\", \"Origin\", \"Origin One\", \"P3\", \"Stratasys Direct Manufacturing\", \"GrabCAD\", \"GrabCAD Print\", \"GrabCAD Shop\",\n\"GrabCAD Streamline Pro\", \"OpenAM\", \"DentaJet\", \"MediJet\", \"Digital Anatomy\", \"TissueMatrix\", \"GelMatrix\", \"BoneMatrix\", \"Neo\", \"Neo800\", \"Neo450\",\n\"H350\", \"H Series\", \"SAF\", \"Somos\", \"WaterShed\", \"PerFORM\", \"Addigy\" and all product names and trade names used by us in this annual report are our\ntrademarks and service marks, which may be registered in certain jurisdictions.

If any of these risks actually materializes, our business, financial condition and results of operations\ncould suffer and the price of our shares could decline.\nSummary of Risk Factors:\nThe following constitutes a summary of the material risks relevant to an investment in our company:\nRisks related to our business and financial condition\n• We may not succeed at introducing new or improved products and solutions that gain market share.\n• Our annual and quarterly operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\n• Demand for our products and services may not grow as we expect.\n• The 3D printing market generally may not grow as we expect.\n• Global macro-economic trends such as inflation, rising interest rates and potential recessionary conditions, may have material adverse consequences for\nour operations, financial position, cash flows, and those of our customers and suppliers.\n• Declines in the prices of our products and services, or in our volume of sales, together with our relatively inflexible cost structure, may adversely affect our\nfinancial results.\n• To the extent that other companies are successful in developing or marketing consumables for use in our systems, our revenues and profits would likely be\nadversely affected.\n• If our product mix shifts too far into lower margin products or our revenues mix shifts significantly towards our additive manufacturing (“AM”) services\nbusiness, our profitability could be reduced.\n• Competition and new technologies may cut into our market share.\n• Impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in respect of companies that we acquire would adversely impact our results of operations for the periods\nin which they occur.\n• Our failure to successfully consummate acquisitions of, or investments in, new business, technologies, products or services, to integrate them into our\nexisting company, or to realize from them expected performance, may adversely affect our financial results.\n• Our operations could suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key management, directors or other key employees.\n• Global interruptions and delays involving freight carriers and other third parties may interfere with our supply chain and distribution network and frustrate\nour ability to sell our existing and new products.\n• If we do not maximize our recurring stream of revenues from the sale of consumables and service contracts, our operating results may be adversely\naffected.\n• Global market, political and economic conditions, and in the countries in which we operate in particular, could adversely impact our operating results.\n• Potential hostile actions by a shareholder or other third party, such as Nano Dimension Ltd. or 3D Systems Corporation, including a legal challenge to our\nshareholder rights plan, a potential additional unsolicited tender offer, or a potential additional attempt to remove and replace our directors with its own\nnominees, could materially adversely impact our shareholders’ investment in our company and could also strain our cash resources.\n• Significant disruptions of our information technology systems, including management information systems for inventory management and distribution, or\nbreaches of our data security could adversely affect our business.\n• We own a number of our manufacturing and office facilities, which may limit our ability to move those operations.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\n• Infringement of our intellectual property rights by others (including for replication and sale of consumables for use in our systems), or infringement of\nothers’ intellectual property rights by us, could lead to litigation, could necessitate a redesign of our products to avoid use of certain technology, and may\nhave an adverse impact on our financial results.\n• If we are unable to obtain patent protection for our products or otherwise protect our intellectual property rights, our business could suffer.\n• As our patents expire, additional competitors using our technology could enter the market, which could offer competitive printers and consumables, require\nus to reduce our prices for our products and result in lost sales.\nRisks related to operations in Israel\n• Israel’s war against the terrorist organization Hamas and its hostilities with additional regional terrorist groups may adversely affect our operations.\n• Exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the New Israeli Shekel (in particular), the Euro, the Yen and other non-U.S. currencies may\nnegatively affect the earnings of our operations.\n• We are currently eligible for Israeli government tax benefits in respect of our Israeli operations. If we do not meet several conditions for receipt of those\nbenefits, or if the Israeli government otherwise decides to eliminate those benefits, they may be terminated or reduced.\nRisks related to an investment in our ordinary shares\n• The market price of our ordinary shares may be subject to fluctuation, regardless of our operating results and financial condition. As a result, our\nshareholders could incur substantial losses.\n• We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nRisks related to our business and financial condition\nWe may not be able to introduce new 3D printers, high-performance systems and consumables acceptable to customers or to improve the technology,\nsoftware or consumables used in our current systems in response to changing technology and end-user needs.\nWe derive most of our revenues from the sale of additive manufacturing systems and related consumables. The markets in which we operate are subject to rapid\nand substantial innovation and technological change, mainly driven by technological advances and end-user requirements and preferences, as well as the\nemergence of new standards and practices. Our ability to compete in these markets depends, in large part, on our success in enhancing our existing products and\ndeveloping new additive manufacturing systems and new consumables that will address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of prospective end-users,\nand respond to technological advances and industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis or otherwise gain market acceptance. In keeping\nwith our strategic goal of strengthening our position in polymers and in the fast-growing mass production parts market, we acquired Origin Laboratories, Inc., or\nOrigin, and its P3™ Programmable PhotoPolymerization technology in December 2020, which we believe will help to further strengthen our position in that area.\nIn order to further expand our polymer suite of solutions across the product life cycle, in 2021, we acquired UK-based RP Support Ltd., or RPS, a provider of\nindustrial stereolithography 3D printers and solutions, and Xaar 3D Ltd., or Xaar, and its powder-based SAF™ technology, thereby accelerating our growth in\nproduction-scale 3D printing.\nEven if we successfully utilize new acquired technologies or organically developed technologies to create new systems or enhance our existing systems, it is\nlikely that new systems and technologies that we develop will eventually supplant our existing systems or that our competitors will create systems that will replace\nour systems. As a result, any of our products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by our or others’ technological advances.\n2\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nThe operating results and financial condition of our company may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year and are likely to continue to vary due to a\nnumber of factors, many of which will not be within our control. We do not always have visibility as to the expected movements of the global economy and,\nconsequently, as to the expected changes in our operating results over time. This began during the COVID pandemic, during which we began analyzing our\nquarterly results on a linear basis, comparing consecutive quarters with one another, in addition to comparing each quarter with the corresponding quarter of the\nprevious year, thereby enabling us to track the most updated economic trends and their impact on our operating results.After having suspended providing quarterly\nor annual guidance in the second quarter of 2020, we returned to providing guidance (initially, on a more limited basis) in subsequent years. However, if our\noperating results do not meet that guidance or the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our ordinary shares will likely decline.\nFluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors, including the latest global economic developments concerning\ninflation, interest rates and unemployment, as well as those additional factors listed below and those identified throughout this “Risk Factors” section:\n• the degree of market acceptance of our products and services, particularly in the fast-growing sector of mass production parts;\n• the mix of products and services that we sell during any period;\n• the geographic distribution of our sales;\n• our responses to price competition;\n• long sales cycles;\n• unforeseen liabilities or difficulties in integrating our acquisitions or newly acquired businesses;\n• changes in the amount that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, consumables, technologies or businesses;\n• changes in the amounts that we spend to promote our products and services;\n• changes in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of systems;\n• delays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced systems and consumables and the generation of sales from those products;\n• delays in orders of our products from period to period due to outside factors, such as U.S. government shutdowns, which may delay orders by U.S.\ngovernment agencies or other end-users whose business activities are heavily dependent on U.S. government agency contracts;\n• global interruptions and delays involving freight carriers and other third parties, which may interfere with our supply chain and distribution network and\nfrustrate our ability to sell our existing and new products;\n• development of new competitive products and services by others;\n• difficulty in predicting sales patterns and reorder rates that may result from multi-tier distribution strategy associated with new product categories such as\nentry level desktop 3D printers;\n• impairment charges that we may be required to record in respect of our goodwill and/or other long-lived assets;\n• potential cyber attacks against, or other breaches to, our information technologies systems;\n• litigation or threats of litigation, including intellectual property claims by third parties;\n• changes in accounting rules and tax laws;\n• tax benefit that we may record due to partial or full release of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets;\n3\n• general economic and industry conditions that affect end-user demand and end-user levels of product design and manufacturing; and\n• changes in dollar-shekel and dollar-Euro exchange rates that affect the value of our net assets, revenues and expenditures from and/or relating to our\nactivities carried out in those currencies;\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this annual report, you should not rely on quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year\ncomparisons of our operating results as an indicator of our future performance.\nIf demand for our products and services, or in the 3D printing market generally, does not grow as expected, our revenues may stagnate or decline and our\nprofitability may be adversely affected.\nThe commercial marketplace for prototyping and manufacturing, which was once dominated by conventional production technologies, is gradually adopting\nadditive manufacturing as a new production technology. This is true with respect to prototype development, and to a growing extent, with respect to direct digital\nmanufacturing, or DDM, as an alternative to traditional manufacturing. If the commercial marketplace does not continue to transform towards the broader\nacceptance of 3D printing and DDM as alternatives for prototype development and traditional manufacturing, or if it adopts 3D printing based on technologies\nother than the technologies that we use, we may not be able to increase or sustain current or future levels of sales of our products and related materials and\nservices, and our results of operations may be adversely affected as a result.\nAdverse macro-economic trends such as inflation and higher interest rates have been adversely affecting, and may continue to adversely affect, potentially in a\nmore material manner our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain recent global macro-economic trends have been adversely impacting the global economic environment. The infusion of money into circulation as part\nof a “loose” monetary policy to encourage consumer spending, along with historically low interest rates for an extended period of time, which were designed to\nease economic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, triggered upwards pressure on prices of goods, and services. The high rates of inflation globally caused\ngovernments and central banks to act to curb inflation, including by raising interest rates, which may potentially stifle economic activity to a large enough extent to\ncause a recession, whether in individual countries or regions, or globally. In certain cases, shifts in interest rates have impacted investor preferences as to\ninvestments in different countries, which has triggered shifts in exchange rates between various currencies, which has, in turn, exerted an unsteady impact on our\nresults of operations.\nSince 2022, these macro-economic trends have been adversely impacting our target markets and our results of operations. For example, higher interest rates,\nwhich were imposed by central banks to slow down inflation, have been worsening credit/financing conditions for our customers and adversely impacting their\nability to purchase our products.\nIn light of these uncertainties, we continue to monitor the cost-control measures that we first implemented in February 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic\nbegan, some of which we have maintained in place since that time.\nWhile we believe that we remain well-positioned to withstand the current adverse macro-economic trends, given our balance sheet (primarily due to our cash\nreserves and lack of debt) and our emphasis on operational efficiencies and execution, we continue to monitor the situation, assessing further implications for our\noperations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and customer orders, in an effort to mitigate potential new adverse consequences should they arise. However, there is\nno assurance that we will continue to succeed at doing so.\nA potential downturn could also have a material adverse impact on our business partners’ stability and financial strength. Given the uncertainties associated with\nthese macroeconomic trends, it is difficult to fully predict the magnitude of their effects on our, and our business partners’, business, financial condition and results\nof operations.\n4\nThe guidance that we provide for 2024 and for future periods (including medium term guidance) may lack the degree of certainty that we once had in providing\nguidance, due to the number of variables surrounding the current macro-economic environment.\nThe trends associated with the current economic environment may also have the effect of amplifying many of the other risks described herein.\nDeclines in the prices of our products and services, or in our volume of sales, together with our relatively inflexible cost structure and increased costs of\nproducing and selling our products, may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur business is subject to price competition. Such price competition may adversely affect our ability to maintain the same degree of profitability, especially\nduring periods of decreased demand. Decreased demand also adversely impacts the volume of our systems sales. If our business is not able to offset price\nreductions resulting from these pressures, or decreased volume of sales due to contractions in the market, by improved operating efficiencies and reduced\nexpenditures, then our operating results will be adversely affected.\nCertain of our operating costs are fixed and cannot readily be reduced, which diminishes the positive impact of our reorganization programs on our operating\nresults. To the extent the market for our products slows, or the 3D printing market contracts, we may be faced with excess manufacturing capacity and excess\nrelated costs that cannot readily be reduced, which will adversely impact our results of operations. The impact of rising inflation on the cost of producing and\nselling our products has also made it more difficult for us to maintain our profit margins and thereby also adversely impacting our results of operations.\nTo the extent that other companies are successful in developing or marketing consumables for use in our systems, our revenues and profits would likely be\nadversely affected.\nWe sell a substantial portion of the consumables used in our systems. We attempt to protect against replication of our proprietary consumables through\ndifferentiation patents and trade secrets and provide that warranties on those systems may be invalid if customers use non-genuine consumables. We have also\nacquired companies that sell our materials, as a means to broaden our official materials offerings. Other companies have nevertheless developed and sold, and may\ncontinue to develop and sell, consumables that are used with our systems, which may reduce our consumables sales and impair our overall revenues and\nprofitability.\nIf our product mix shifts too far into lower margin products or our revenues mix shifts significantly towards our AM services business, our profitability could\nbe reduced.\nSales of certain of our existing products have higher margins than others. For instance, some of our high-end systems and related consumables yield a greater\ngross margin than our entry-level systems. Sales of our entry-level systems may displace sales of our other systems. If sales of our entry-level systems have the\neffect of reducing sales of our higher margin products, or if for any other reason, our product mix shifts too far into lower margin products, and we are not able to\nsufficiently reduce the engineering, production and other costs associated with those products or substantially increase the sales of those products, our profitability\ncould be reduced. A similar negative impact on our gross margins could result due to a significant shift towards revenues generated by our AM parts service\nbusiness, Stratasys Direct, which are characterized by lower margins relative to our products.\n5\nThe markets in which we participate are competitive. Our failure to compete successfully could cause our revenues and the demand for our products to\ndecline.\nWe compete with a wide variety of producers of systems that create 3D printed models, prototypes, manufacturing aids, medical guides and end-use parts as\nwell as producers of materials, services and software for these systems, including both additive and subtractive manufacturing methodologies, such as metal\nextrusion, computer-controlled machining and manual modeling techniques. Our principal competition currently consists of other manufacturers of systems for\nprototype development and manufacturing processes, including 3D Systems Corporation, HP, Carbon, EOS GmbH, Formlabs, Markforged and Desktop Metal\n(following their acquisition of EnvisionTEC). For our broadened AM parts and services business, our chief competitors consist of 3D Systems, Materialise,\nProtolabs and many other smaller service providers. We may face additional competition in the future from other new entrants into the marketplace, including\ncompanies that may have significantly greater resources than we have that may become new market entrants or may enter through acquisition or strategic or\nmarketing partnerships with current competitors.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and more extensive name recognition than we have and may also have greater\nfinancial, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than we have. Current and future competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or\nemerging technologies and changes in end-user demands and to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Our\ncurrent and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive\n(whether from a price perspective or otherwise). We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain or enhance our current competitive position or continue to\ncompete successfully against current and future sources of competition.\nIf additional goodwill or other intangible assets that we have recorded become impaired, we could have to take future charges against earnings\nAs of December 31, 2023, the carrying value of all of our goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately $227.8 million compared to a carrying value\nof $186.3 million as of December 31, 2022.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, we are required to review goodwill for impairment annually and\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. Intangible assets are generally amortized into\nearning based on their useful life, but are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be\nrecoverable.\nAny impairment to our goodwill and intangible assets in the future could result in further significant charges against our earnings and could have a material\nadverse effect on our results of operations. For further information, please see Notes 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this\nannual report.\n6\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have sought, and will continue to seek, to acquire or to make investments in other businesses, patents, technologies, products\nor services. Our failure to do so successfully (including, if applicable, to finance such acquisitions or investments on favorable terms, to avoid adverse\nfinancial consequences, and to realize expected results from such acquisitions, investments or divestments) may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur growth strategy, which we sometimes refer to as our “North Star” strategy, is focused on providing a complete portfolio offering of products and services\nwithin additive manufacturing, initially in polymers, and after which we expect to add other areas, including metal printing, in the near future. In order to\nimplement this strategy, we expect to continue to regularly evaluate acquisitions or investments to expand our suite of products and services. Even if we are able to\nidentify a suitable acquisition or investment, we may not be able to consummate any such transaction if we cannot reach an agreement on favorable terms or if we\nlack sufficient resources to finance the transaction on our own and cannot obtain financing at a reasonable cost or if regulatory authorities prevent such transaction\nfrom being consummated. If we proceed with a particular acquisition or investment, we may have to use cash, issue new equity securities with dilutive effects on\nexisting shareholders, incur indebtedness, assume contingent liabilities or amortize assets or expenses in a manner that might have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Acquisitions will also require us to record certain acquisition-related costs and other items as current period\nexpenses, which would have the effect of reducing our reported earnings in the period in which an acquisition is consummated. In addition, we could also face\nunknown liabilities or write-offs due to our acquisitions and investments, which could result in a significant charge to our earnings in the period in which they\noccur. We will also be required to record goodwill or other long-lived asset impairment charges (if any) in the periods in which they occur, which could result in a\nsignificant charge to our earnings in any such period. If an acquired entity or investment does not perform as projected and in accordance with our expectations,\nand is not accretive to our earnings, it may adversely impact our overall results of operations and hurt, rather than help, our business. We may decide to divest the\nacquired assets in such a situation, in order to generate cash or even merely to stop potential future losses.\nOur operations could suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key management or other key employees in the Israeli market or other markets in which we\noperate where competition for highly skilled technical and other personnel is intense.\nOur success depends upon the continued service and performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our executive team is critical to the\nmanagement of our business and operations, as well as to the development of our strategy. The loss of the services of any members of our senior executive team\ncould delay or prevent the successful implementation of our strategy, or our commercialization of new applications for our systems or other products, or could\notherwise adversely affect our ability to manage our company effectively and carry out our business plan. During 2023 we experienced minimal changes within our\nmanagement team, which provided a year for the team to mature. There can be no assurance that we will be able to keep up our retention rate in the future, and if\nwe need to fill additional management positions in the future, that we will be able to rapidly do so, without any adverse impact on our operations.\n7\nOur dependence on key employees extends beyond our senior executive team, to our highly skilled scientific, technical (including software) and sales personnel.\nOur principal research and development as well as significant elements of our general and administrative activities are conducted at one of our two headquarters, in\nIsrael, and we face significant competition for suitably skilled employees in Israel. While there has been intense competition for qualified human resources in the\nIsraeli high-tech industry historically (including the additive manufacturing, or AM, industry in which we operate), the industry experienced record growth and\nactivity in the last couple of years, both at the earlier stages of venture capital and growth equity financings, and at the exit stage of initial public offerings and\nmergers and acquisitions. This flurry of growth and activity has caused an increase in job openings in both Israeli high-tech companies and Israeli research and\ndevelopment centers of foreign companies, and intensification of competition between these employers to attract qualified employees in Israel. As a result, the\nhigh-tech industry in Israel has experienced significant levels of employee attrition and is currently facing a severe shortage of skilled human capital, including\nengineering, research and development, software, sales and customer support personnel. This trend has moderated in the 2nd half of 2023. Similar shortages of key\npersonnel also exist in the regions surrounding our Minnesota facilities. Companies with which we compete for qualified personnel may have greater resources\nthan we do, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional experienced or professional personnel, retaining personnel or effectively replacing current personnel\nwho may depart with qualified or effective successors. If we cannot attract and retain sufficiently qualified technical employees for our research and development\nand/or product development activities (including for the software in our products), we may be unable to achieve the synergies expected from mergers and\nacquisitions that we may effect from time to time, or to develop and commercialize new products or new applications for existing products.\nIn addition, as a result of the competition for qualified human resources, the Israeli high-tech and other high-tech markets have also experienced and may\ncontinue to experience significant wage inflation. Accordingly, our efforts to attract, retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional\nexpenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, in making employment decisions, particularly in the high-technology industry, job\ncandidates often consider the value of the equity they are to receive in connection with their employment. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares\nthey own or the shares underlying their equity incentive awards have significantly appreciated or significantly decreased in value. Many of our employees may\nreceive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us and could heighten the\nrisk of employee attrition.\nWhile we utilize non-competition agreements with our employees in jurisdictions where non-compete undertakings are lawful, as a means of improving our\nemployee retention, those agreements may not be effective towards that goal. These agreements prohibit our employees, if they cease working for us, from\ncompeting directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. We may be unable to enforce these agreements under Israeli law or the law of other\njurisdictions, and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from benefiting from the expertise our former employees developed while working for us.\nIn light of the foregoing, there can be no assurance that qualified employees will remain in our employ or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified\npersonnel in the future. Failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nDefects in new products or in enhancements to our existing products could give rise to product returns or product liability, warranty or other claims that could\nresult in material expenses, diversion of management time and attention, and damage to our reputation.\nOur products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication,\npackaging, materials, and/or use within a system. These defects or errors could result in significant warranty, support and repair or replacement costs, cause us to\nlose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.\n8\nThis risk of product liability claims may also be greater due to the use of certain hazardous chemicals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. Those\nhazardous chemicals fall within three different categories (with several of the chemicals falling within multiple categories): irritants, harmful chemicals and\nchemicals dangerous for the environment. In addition, we may be subject to claims that our 3D printers have been, or may be, used to create parts that are not in\ncompliance with legal requirements or that intellectual property posted by third parties on our GrabCAD website infringes the intellectual property rights of others.\nAny claim brought against us, regardless of its merit, could result in material expense, diversion of management time and attention, and damage to our\nreputation, and could cause us to fail to retain existing end-users or to attract new end-users. Although we maintain product liability insurance, such insurance is\nsubject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims, or we may elect to\nself-insure with respect to certain matters. Costs or payments made in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls or other claims\ncould materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales of end-use parts to customers in the aerospace, medical, dental and automotive industries, and of 3D printing systems to customers in the aerospace\nindustry, carry with them a greater potential for liability claims against us.\nOur manufacturing services business, Stratasys Direct Manufacturing, produces parts used as prototypes, benchmarks, and end-use parts. In the case of end-use\nparts, our sales to customers in the aerospace, medical, dental and automotive industries, in particular, makes us more susceptible to product and other liability\nclaims, which characterize operations in those industries. Sales of our 3D printing systems to customers in the aerospace industry similarly carry with them\npotential liability claims if the parts produced by those systems do not function properly. Any such claims that are not adequately covered by insurance or for\nwhich insurance is not available may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our relationships with suppliers for our products and services, especially with single source suppliers of components of our products, were to terminate or\nour manufacturing arrangements were to be disrupted, our business could be interrupted.\nWe purchase components and sub-assemblies for our systems, raw materials that are used in our consumables, and AM systems, component parts and raw\nmaterials for our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing services business, from third-party suppliers, some of whom may compete with us. While there are several\npotential suppliers of most of these component parts, sub-assemblies and raw materials that we use, we currently choose to use only one or a limited number of\nsuppliers for several of these components and materials. Furthermore, the suppliers of AM systems and materials used in our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing parts\nservice may refuse to sell us additional AM systems or component parts and materials for AM systems that our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing service uses. Our\nreliance on a single or limited number of vendors involves a number of risks, including:\n• potential shortages of some key components;\n• product performance shortfalls, if traceable to particular product components, since the supplier of the faulty component cannot readily be replaced;\n• discontinuation of a product or certain materials on which we rely;\n• potential insolvency of these vendors; and\n• reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capabilities, quality and costs.\n9\nIn addition, we require any new supplier to become “qualified” pursuant to our internal procedures. The qualification process involves evaluations of varying\ndurations, which may cause production delays if we were required to qualify a new supplier unexpectedly. We generally assemble our systems and parts based on\nour internal forecasts and the availability of raw materials, assemblies, components and finished goods that are supplied to us by third parties, which are subject to\nvarious lead times. If certain suppliers were to decide to discontinue production of an assembly, component or raw material that we use, the unanticipated change\nin the availability of supplies, or unanticipated supply limitations, could cause delays in, or loss of, sales, increased production or related costs and consequently\nreduced margins, and damage to our reputation. If we were unable to find a suitable supplier for a particular component, material or compound, we could be\nrequired to modify our existing products or the end- parts that we offer to accommodate substitute components, material or compounds. While we have introduced\nperiodic risk analysis internally concerning our sourcing (particularly concerning raw materials), which has increased the levels of our inventories, there is no\nguarantee that will sufficiently protect us if we suddenly lose access to supplies unexpectedly.\nIn particular, we rely on a sole supplier, Ricoh Printing Systems America, Inc., or Ricoh, for the printer heads for our PolyJet 3D printers. Under the terms of\nour agreement with Ricoh, we purchase printer heads and associated electronic components, and receive a non-transferable, non-exclusive right to assemble, use\nand sell these purchased products under Ricoh’s patent rights and trade secrets. Due to the risk of a discontinuation of the supply of Ricoh printer heads and other\nkey components of our products, we maintain excess inventory of those printer heads and other components. However, if our forecasts exceed actual orders, we\nmay hold large inventories of slow- moving or unusable parts or raw materials, which could result in inventory write offs or write downs and have an adverse\neffect on our cash flow, profitability and results of operations. See “Item 4. Information on the Company-Business Overview-Manufacturing and Suppliers-\nInventory and Suppliers-Ricoh Agreement” for further discussion of this agreement.\nDiscontinuation of operations at our manufacturing sites could prevent us from timely filling customer orders and could lead to unforeseen costs for us.\nWe assemble and test the systems that we sell, and, in many cases, produce consumables for our systems, at single facilities in various locations that are\nspecifically dedicated to separate categories of systems and consumables. We similarly rely on a single facility for assembly of the component parts and materials\nfor AM systems that our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing service uses. Because of our reliance on all of these production facilities, a disruption at any of those\nfacilities could materially damage our ability to supply 3D printers, other systems or consumable materials to the marketplace in a timely manner. Depending on\nthe cause of the disruption, we could also incur significant costs to remedy the disruption and resume product shipments. Such disruptions may be caused by,\namong other factors, earthquakes, fire, flood and other natural disasters. There are no assurances that we will be adequately protected from any significant\ndisruptions at our manufacturing sites. Accordingly, any such disruption could result in a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and earnings,\nand could also potentially damage our reputation.\n10\nA loss of, or reduction in revenues from, a significant number of our resellers and our independent sales agents would impair our ability to sell our products\nand services and could reduce our revenues and adversely impact our operating results.\nWe rely heavily on our network of resellers and independent sales agents to sell and (in the case of resellers) to service our products for end-users in their\nrespective geographic regions. These resellers and sales agents may not be as effective in selling our products or servicing our end-users as we are. Further, if our\nrelationships with a significant number of these resellers and sales agents were to be terminated or if a significant number of these resellers and sales agents would\notherwise fail or refuse to sell our products, we may not be able to find replacements that are as qualified or as successful in a timely manner, if at all. If these\nresellers and independent sales agents do not perform as anticipated or if we are unable to find qualified and successful replacements, our sales will suffer, which\nwould have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results. Additionally, a default by one or more resellers that have a significant receivables balance\ncould have an adverse financial impact on our financial results.\nGlobal interruptions and delays involving freight carriers and other third parties have adversely impacted, and may once again adversely impact our supply\nchain and distribution network, and, consequently, frustrate our ability to sell our 3D printing systems, especially those systems that are based on newly\nacquired technologies that we have recently launched.\nOur business relies on an efficient and effective supply chain, including delivery of raw materials and parts for our 3D printing systems, and the manufacture\nand transport of those systems to resellers or end-users (as applicable). International supply chains were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which\nnegatively affected the flow and availability of our products. While global supply chains have generally returned to normal function since that time, future delays\nand interruptions, similar to those caused by the recent Houthis attacks in the area of the Red Sea-Suez Canal trade route, could once again adversely the\ndistribution of our products. That may also result in higher out-of-stock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining raw materials and parts from our\nsuppliers, as well as transportation of our products after manufacture to our distribution destinations. Further, as a result of such delays, we may need to source raw\nmaterials and parts from different geographic locations or manufacturers, which could result in, among other things, higher product costs, increased transportation\ncosts, delays in sales of our products or lower quality of our products. The adverse impact of these irregularities in our supply chain on our ability to distribute our\n3D printing systems may be most acute for systems that are based on our three recently-acquired technologies, where we have just recently implemented our\ndistribution channels.\nAdditionally, the operation of our manufacturing facilities, where our 3D printing systems are assembled, is crucial to our business operations. If our\nmanufacturing facilities experience closures or worker shortages (similar to what occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic), whether temporary or sustained, we\ncould sustain significant adverse impacts related to the distribution of our products to their destinations, whether to resellers or end-users (as applicable).\nAny of these circumstances could adversely affect our ability to deliver our 3D printing systems in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet\ncustomer demand for products and result in lost sales and services revenues, increased supply chain costs, and, potentially, damage to our reputation.\n11\nOur business model is predicated in part on building an end-user base that will generate a recurring stream of revenues through our sale of consumables and\nservice contracts. If that recurring stream of revenues does not continue, or if our business model changes as the industry evolves, our operating results may\nbe adversely affected.\nOur business model is dependent in part on our ability to maintain a differentiated portfolio of proprietary consumables, and to increase our sales of our proprietary\nand third-party consumables and service contracts as that generates recurring revenues. Existing and future end-users of our systems may not purchase our\nconsumables or related service contracts at the same rate at which end-users currently purchase those consumables and services. In addition, the use of our systems\nfor prototyping applications, which is often carried out with entry-level systems generally requires a lower volume of consumables relative to the use of our\nsystems for manufacturing, which is usually carried out with our higher end systems. If our current and future end-users do not transition towards manufacturing\napplications for our systems that are handled through our high end systems and do not, therefore, purchase a higher volume of our consumables, or if our end users\ndo not enter into an increasing number of service contracts with us, our recurring revenue stream relative to our total revenues would be reduced, and our operating\nresults would be adversely affected.\nGlobal economic, political and social conditions may adversely impact our sales.\nUncertainty with respect to the global economy, difficulties in the financial services sector and credit markets, geopolitical uncertainties and other\nmacroeconomic factors all affect spending behavior of potential end-users of our products and services. The uncertain prospects for economic growth in some of\nthe regions in which we sell our products may cause end-users to delay or reduce technology purchases. We also face risks that may arise from financial difficulties\nexperienced by our end-users, suppliers and distributors, which may be exacerbated by continued uncertainty in the global economy or by other geopolitical\nfactors, including:\n• increased interest rates in many countries and regions throughout the world, including the regions where our customers are located;\n• supply chain disruptions, which have slowed the delivery of raw materials, and which have increased the price of certain materials due to the significant\nincrease in costs of raw materials and shipping costs;\n• the ongoing U.S.- China trade war may impact the cost of raw materials, finished products or components used in our products, and our ability to sell our\nproducts in China;\n• threats of massive cyber attacks that could cause severe economic damage;\n• extended U.S. federal government shutdowns (resulting from the failure to pass budget appropriations or adopt continuing funding resolutions) may delay\norders of our products by U.S. government agencies or other end-users whose business activities are heavily dependent on U.S. government agency\ncontracts;\n• end-user demand for products and manufacturing activity levels may be reduced;\n• distributors and end-users may be unable to obtain credit financing to finance purchases of our products;\n• suppliers may be unable to obtain credit financing to finance purchases of sub-assemblies used to build components of products or purchases of raw\nmaterials to produce consumables;\n• end-users or distributors may face financial difficulties or may become insolvent, which could lead to our inability to obtain payment for our products; and\n• key suppliers of raw materials, finished products or components used in our products and consumables may face financial difficulties or may become\ninsolvent, which could lead to disruption in the supply of systems, consumables or spare parts to our end-users.\n12\nOur existing and planned international operations currently expose us and will continue to expose us to additional market and operational risks, and failure to\nmanage these risks may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe expect to derive a substantial percentage of our sales from international markets. We derived 37.9% of our revenues in 2023 from countries outside the\nAmericas. Accordingly, we face significant operational risks from doing business internationally, including:\n• fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n• potentially longer sales and payment cycles;\n• potentially greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n• potentially adverse tax consequences;\n• reduced protection of intellectual property rights in certain countries, particularly in Asia and South America;\n• difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n• laws and business practices favoring local competition;\n• costs and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries;\n• compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations;\n• tariffs, trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets; and\n• being subject to the laws, regulations and the court systems of many jurisdictions.\nOur failure to manage the market and operational risks associated with our international operations effectively could limit the future growth of our business and\nadversely affect our operating results.\nSignificant cybersecurity disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of our data security could adversely affect our business.\nA significant invasion, interruption, destruction or breakdown of our information technology, or IT, systems and/or infrastructure by persons with authorized or\nunauthorized access could negatively impact our business and operations. We could also experience business interruption, information theft and/or reputational\ndamage from cyber attacks, which may compromise our systems and lead to data leakage either internally or at our third party providers. Both data that has been\ninputted into our main IT platform, which covers records of transactions, financial data and other data reflected in our results of operations, as well as data related\nto our proprietary rights (such as research and development, and other intellectual property- related data), are subject to material cyber security risks. Our IT\nsystems have been, and are expected to continue to be, the target of malware and other cyber attacks. To date, we are not aware that we have experienced any loss\nof, or disruption to, material information as a result of any such malware or cyber attack.\nWe have invested in advanced protective systems to reduce these risks, some of which have been installed and others that are still in the process of installation.\nBased on information provided to us by the suppliers of our protective systems, we believe that our level of protection is in keeping with the customary practices of\npeer technology companies, market standards and best practice. We also maintain back-up files for much of our information, as a means of assuring that a breach\nor cyber attack does not necessarily cause the loss of that information. We furthermore review our protections and remedial measures periodically in order to\nensure that they are adequate.\n13\nDespite these protective systems and remedial measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing, are becoming increasingly\nmore sophisticated and often are not recognized until after an exploitation of information has occurred. We may be unable to anticipate these techniques or\nimplement sufficient preventative measures, and we therefore cannot assure you that our preventative measures will be successful in preventing compromise and/or\ndisruption of our information technology systems and related data. We furthermore cannot be certain that our remedial measures will fully mitigate the adverse\nfinancial consequences of any cyber attack or incident.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and export control laws due to the import and export of our products, as well as environmental, health, safety and\nmedical device laws and regulations related to our operations and the use of our systems and materials, including requirements imposed due to use of our\nproducts by our customers, which could subject us to compliance costs and/or potential liability in the event of non-compliance.\nThe export of our products internationally subjects us to environmental laws and regulations concerning the import and export of chemicals and hazardous\nsubstances such as the United States Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, and the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical\nSubstances, or REACH. These laws and regulations require the testing and registration of some chemicals that we ship along with, or that form a part of, our\nsystems and other products. If we fail to comply with these or similar laws and regulations, we may be required to make significant expenditures to reformulate the\nchemicals that we use in our products and materials or incur costs to register such chemicals to gain and/or regain compliance. Additionally, we could be subject to\nsignificant fines or other civil and criminal penalties should we not achieve such compliance.\nThe export of our products is also subject to several export regulations, including but not limited to the United States. Export Administration Regulations, the\nUnited States International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the United States Arms Export Control Act and regulations and orders administered by the United States\nTreasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (which we refer to collectively as Export/Import Laws). Our products are governed by civil controls, but\nfailure to comply with these Export/Import Laws may potentially lead to the imposition of greater restrictions on our ability to export those products and penalties\nif we fail to comply with our restrictions.\nWe are furthermore subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements in multiple jurisdictions due to our use of\nchemicals and production of waste materials as part of our operations and in connection with the operation of our systems by our customers. In certain cases, the\nrequired compliance with health or safety regulations is imposed by our customers themselves. These laws, regulations and requirements (which include the\nDirective on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment of the European Union (EU) and the EU Directive on Restriction of Use of Certain Hazardous Substances)\ngovern, among other things, the generation, use, storage, registration, handling and disposal of chemicals and waste materials, the presence of specified substances\nin electrical products, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any\ncontamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals and other waste materials and the health and safety of our employees.\nUnder these laws, regulations and requirements, we could also be subject to liability for improper disposal of chemicals and waste materials, including those\nresulting from the use of our systems and accompanying materials by end-users. These or future laws and regulations could potentially require the expenditure of\nsignificant amounts for compliance and/or remediation. If our operations fail to comply with such laws or regulations, we may be subject to fines and other civil,\nadministrative or criminal sanctions, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In addition, we may be required\nto pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third-party claims, including those relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous substances that we\ngenerate, use, store, handle, transport, manufacture or dispose of), property damage or contribution claims. Some environmental laws allow for strict, joint and\nseveral liabilities for remediation costs, regardless of fault. We may be identified as a potentially responsible party under such laws. Effective as of February 2023,\nwe are also subject to medical device regulations, such as the U.S. FDA Code of Federal Regulations, as a result of our launch of our first certified medical device\nwith TrueDent resin in the United States. We also have plans to expand the countries and products that we certify as medical devices in the coming years.\nIf we fail to comply with any such regulations or are subject to related liability, such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\n14\nAs a public company with significant operations in several countries, we are subject to regulation and must comply with reporting, privacy and other\nrequirements in a number of jurisdictions and, to the extent that regulatory authorities assert that we are not in compliance, we could be subject to sanctions\nwhich, if material, could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAs a public company with significant operations in Israel, the United States, Europe and many other countries, we are subject to regulation and must comply\nwith reporting and other requirements in a number of jurisdictions. In particular, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and FINRA, which may\nelect from time to time to review or investigate our operations, various aspects of our financial statements, our disclosure practices and other matters. As such\nreviews progress, the regulating agencies may determine that we are and have been in compliance with applicable rules, or they may determine to pursue\nenforcement actions or other sanctions against us for alleged noncompliance.\nNew privacy laws are also beginning to impose on our company increased compliance costs. Our California operations are now subject to the California\nConsumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, a statute that went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA imposes enhanced disclosure requirements for us vis-à-vis our\ninteractions with customers that are residents of California, such as comprehensive privacy notices for consumers when we or our agents collect their personal\ninformation. We may be further required to ensure third party compliance, as under the CCPA we could be liable if third parties that collect, process or retain\npersonal information on our behalf violate the CCPA’s privacy requirements. The sanctions for non-compliance could include fines and/or civil lawsuits.\nIn addition to the imposition of U.S.-based regulations on our operations, our European activities are subject to the European Union General Data Protection\nRegulation, or GDPR, which has created additional compliance requirements for us. GDPR broadens the scope of personal privacy laws to protect the rights of\nEuropean Union citizens and requires organizations to report on data breaches within 72 hours and be bound by stringent rules for obtaining the consent of\nindividuals on how their data can be used. GDPR became enforceable on May 25, 2018, and non-compliance exposes entities such as our company to significant\nfines or other regulatory claims. While we have invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary resources to comply with these new privacy\nstandards (both in Europe and in California), to the extent that we fail to adequately comply, that failure could have an adverse effect on our business, financial\nconditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation could result in fines, criminal penalties and an\nadverse effect on our business.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business\nin accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws. We are subject, however, to the risk that our affiliated entities or our and our affiliates’ respective officers,\ndirectors, employees and agents (including distributors of our products) may take action determined to be in violation of such anti-corruption laws, including the\nU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and\nthe U.S. Department of Commerce. Any violation by any of these persons could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, or curtailment\nof operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and\nability to do business.\n15\nWe own a number of our manufacturing and office facilities, which may limit our ability to move those operations. If we were to move some or all of those\noperations, we could incur unforeseen charges.\nWe own buildings in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, which we use to conduct our FDM manufacturing and assembly operations, as well as our office facility in\nRehovot, Israel and manufacturing facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel. Ownership of these buildings and facilities may adversely affect our ability to move some or all of\nthose operations to other locations that may be more favorable. If we were to move any of those operations to other locations, we may have difficulty selling or\nleasing the property that we vacate.\nThis risk also applies to the facilities that we lease under non-cancellable lease agreements, where we cannot freely vacate the facilities. In order to combat\nthese risks, we have limited our commitment under our leases by providing ourselves with a “break” option after three years or less. In most of our leases we have\nalso obtained for ourselves the right to sublease a portion or all of the facilities under the lease.\nThese limitations on our ability to move could result in an impairment charge, as occurred in the prior periods in respect of some of our leased facilities, which\nnegatively impacted our results of operations, and could, in future periods, once again have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDefault in payment by one or more resellers or customers from which we have large account receivable balances could adversely impact our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, our accounts receivable balances have been concentrated with certain resellers or customers. Default by one or more of these resellers or\ncustomers could result in a significant charge against our current reported earnings. We have reviewed our policies that govern credit and collections, and will\ncontinue to monitor them in light of current payment status and economic conditions. In addition, we try to reduce the credit exposures of our accounts receivable\nby credit limits and credit insurance for many of our customers. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to identify potential credit risks will be\nsuccessful. Our inability to timely identify resellers and customers that are credit risks could result in defaults at a time when such resellers or customers have high\naccounts receivable balances with us. Any such default would result in a significant charge against our earnings and adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nWe are, and have been in the recent past, subject to litigation. Any current or future lawsuits to which we are subject may have a significant adverse effect on\nour financial condition or profitability.\nWe are currently, and have been in the recent past, subject to litigation, and could be subject to further litigation in the future.\nWe can provide no assurance as to the outcome of any future lawsuits, and any such actions may result in judgments against us for significant damages.\nResolution of any such matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and\nother proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of\nevidentiary requirements. Regardless of the outcome, litigation has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in significant legal expenses and require\nsignificant attention and resources of management. As a result, any present or future litigation could result in losses, damages and expenses that have a significant\nadverse effect on our financial condition or profitability.\nPotential hostile actions by a shareholder or other third party, such as Nano Dimension Ltd. or 3D Systems Corporation, including a legal challenge to our\nshareholder rights plan, a potential additional unsolicited tender offer, or a potential additional attempt to remove and replace our directors with its own\nnominees, could materially adversely impact our shareholders’ investment in our company and could also strain our cash resources.\n16\nWe are currently subject to litigation in Israel initiated by Nano in which Nano is challenging the validity, under Israeli law, of our shareholder rights plan,\nwhich we adopted once again, on December 21, 2023, for limited duration (one year) with enhanced shareholder protections. Our new shareholder rights plan is\ndesigned to give all shareholders (other than an offeror) a way to voice their position directly to our board of directors on certain types of offers and whether the\nplan should apply to those offers, and in other circumstances, to exempt an offer from the applicability of the rights altogether. The Israeli courts have not\npreviously ruled on the legality of a shareholder rights plan or so-called “poison pill” under the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999, or the Companies Law. On July\n18, 2023, in the context of an interim procedural decision, the court expressed its preliminary view that: it is inclined to rule that rights plans are permissible under\nIsraeli law; the adoption of a rights plan by a board should be viewed “with suspicion”; and a board bears the burden of proving that it was informed, that it acted\nin good faith, that experts were consulted, and that it considered the interests of the company and its shareholders, rather than acting for the sake of entrenching\nitself, when adopting a shareholder rights plan. While this interim ruling opens the way for a potential final court ruling that our shareholder rights plan was valid\nand validly adopted, there can be no assurance that the Israeli court will determine that our board of directors actually met the requisite burden of proof for\nupholding such validity.\nIn addition to its legal challenge to Stratasys’ shareholder rights plan, Nano may also launch, in the future, a hostile tender offer that may be similar to the Nano\ntender offer that it launched on May 25, 2023 and that expired on July 31, 2023, pursuant to which it may seek to acquire our ordinary shares which, together with\nany ordinary shares that it already owns, may represent a majority or, even if less than a majority, a significant percentage of the outstanding ordinary shares. Nano\nhas recently re-initiated its pursuit of an acquisition of our company, announcing on December 23, 2023 a preliminary proposal to purchase all outstanding shares\nof our company that it does not currently own for $16.50 per share in cash. We have acknowledged receipt of Nano’s, offer and have indicated that our board of\ndirectors would consider it as part of the process to explore strategic alternatives for our company, which process was initiated by our board, together with our\nindependent financial and legal advisors, on September 28, 2023. There can be no assurances that if our board determines that pursuit of an alternative strategic\noption, rather than an acquisition by Nano, would better maximize value for our shareholders, that Nano would not once again attempt a hostile tender offer or\nother action to attempt to take over our company in a manner that would not maximize shareholder value.\nNano may also utilize its rights pursuant to the provisions of the Companies Law to demand, as a greater-than 5% shareholder, to call an extraordinary general\nmeeting of shareholders at which the removal of some or all of our then-incumbent directors and the election of Nano’s nominees in their stead would be on the\nagenda. The relevant majority for approval of any such proposal would be an ordinary majority of shares represented in person or by proxy and voting at a general\nmeeting, without excluding the shares of interested shareholders. If Nano were to hold a substantial portion of our ordinary shares when doing so, Nano’s votes in\nfavor of such a proposal would give it an advantage in having the proposal approved.\nTo the extent that the Israeli court invalidates our shareholder rights plan, declares or provides any further remedies to Nano that facilitate, and thereby allow,\nNano to launch a new tender offer that is similar to the expired Nano tender offer, that may result in Nano having another opportunity to attempt to become a\nmajority or significant shareholder of our company. Nano would then have significant ability to impact the operations of Stratasys. Similarly, if Nano succeeds in\nthe future in replacing any of our directors, that would also give it significant influence over the management and policies of Stratasys. Either or both of those\noutcomes would enable Nano to influence the operations of Stratasys for its own interests, which may be to the detriment of our public/minority shareholders.\nNano could use its voting power, whether as a substantial (or even controlling) shareholder or on the Stratasys board, to significantly influence the policies of our\ncompany in a manner that benefits Nano and adversely impacts the company and its results of operations in a material way. Nano’s possession of a substantial or\ncontrolling interest in Stratasys could also adversely impact trading in Stratasys’ ordinary shares and liquidity for Stratasys’ public/minority shareholders,\npotentially causing a decline in the value of public shareholders’ investment in Stratasys.\n17\nUnder applicable employment laws, we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from\nbenefiting from the expertise of some of our former employees.\nWe generally enter into non-competition agreements with our employees in jurisdictions where non-compete undertakings are lawful and enforceable. These\nagreements prohibit our employees from competing directly with us or working for our competitors or clients for a limited period after they cease working for us.\nWe may be unable to enforce these agreements under the laws of the jurisdictions in which our employees work and it may be difficult for us to restrict our\ncompetitors from benefiting from the expertise that our former employees or consultants developed while working for us. For example, Israeli courts have required\nemployers seeking to enforce non-compete undertakings of a former employee to demonstrate that the competitive activities of the former employee will harm one\nof a limited number of material interests of the employer that have been recognized by the courts, such as the secrecy of a company’s confidential commercial\ninformation or the protection of its intellectual property. If we cannot demonstrate that such interests will be harmed, we may be unable to prevent our competitors\nfrom benefiting from the expertise of our former employees or consultants and our ability to remain competitive may be diminished. As to our U.S. operations, in\nCalifornia, where many employees of our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing parts service as well as Origin's employees, are located, non-competition agreements\nwith employees are generally illegal, void and unenforceable after termination of employment, regardless of when the agreement was signed or whether it was\nsigned in California. Other states as well have been expanding laws restricting the use of non-compete clauses. On the U.S. federal level, there was movement in\n2023 by federal agencies to make noncompete agreements unenforceable in general. The Federal Trade Commission proposed a new rule to ban employers\nnationwide from using non-compete agreements with their employees and independent contractors, and the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board\nissued a memo in March 2023 opining that many types of non-compete and non-solicitation restrictions unlawfully interfere with employees’ protected rights under\nSection 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. If any of these proposed new U.S. federal restrictions becomes effective, or if more states in which we have\noperations continue to expand restrictions or bans on use of non-compete restrictions, that could adversely impact our ability to protect our investment in our key\nemployees in our U.S. locations, and harm our competitive position.\nWe rely on our management information systems for inventory management, distribution, and other key functions. If our information systems fail to\nadequately perform these functions, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems. We rely on our management information systems: to, among\nother things, effectively manage our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; to manage our manufacturing and supply\nchain processes; and to maintain our research and development data. The failure of our management information systems to perform properly could disrupt our\nbusiness and product development, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing our\nbusiness and operating results to suffer.\nAlthough we take steps to secure our management information systems, including our computer systems, intranet and internet sites, email and other\ntelecommunications and data networks, the security measures we have implemented may not be effective and our systems may be vulnerable to theft, loss, damage\nand interruption from a number of potential sources and events, including unauthorized access or security breaches, natural or man-made disasters (such as floods\nor earthquakes), cyber-attacks, computer viruses, power loss, or other disruptive events. Our reputation, brand, and financial condition could be adversely affected\nif, as a result of a significant cyber event or otherwise, our operations are disrupted or shut down; our confidential, proprietary information is stolen or disclosed;\nwe incur costs or are required to pay fines in connection with stolen customer, employee, or other confidential information; we must dedicate significant resources\nto system repairs or increase cyber security protection; or we otherwise incur significant litigation or other costs.\n18\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we are unable to obtain patent protection for our products or otherwise protect our intellectual property rights, our business could suffer.\nWe rely on a combination of patent and trademark laws in the United States and other countries, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other\ncontractual arrangements with our employees, end-users and others to maintain our competitive position. In particular, our success depends, in part, on our ability,\nand the ability of our licensors, to obtain patent protection for our and their products, technologies and inventions, maintain the confidentiality of our and their\ntrade secrets and know-how, operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and prevent others from infringing upon our and their proprietary\nrights. As we acquire additional companies and their technologies, such as Origin and its P3 technology, acquired in December 2020, RPS and its stereolithography\ntechnology, acquired in February 2021, Xaar and its powder-based SAF technology, acquired fully in November 2021, and our latest acquisition of the Covestro\nAdditive Manufacturing business unit in April 2023,the risks related to potential infringement of our proprietary rights in technology become more pronounced.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our\ntechnologies, inventions, processes or improvements. We cannot assure you that any of our existing or future patents or other intellectual property rights will not be\nchallenged, invalidated or circumvented, or will otherwise provide us with meaningful protection. Our pending patent applications may not be granted, and we may\nnot be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents. The laws of certain countries, such as China, may not provide the\nsame level of patent protection and intellectual property right enforcement as in the United States, so even if we enforce our intellectual property rights or obtain\nadditional patents in China or elsewhere outside of the United States, enforcement of such rights may not be effective. If our patents and other intellectual property\ndo not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer additive manufacturing systems, consumables or other products similar to ours. Our\ncompetitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents, and we may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of\nour proprietary technology or take appropriate steps to prevent such use.\nIf we attempt enforcement of our intellectual property rights, we may be (as we have been in the past) subject or party to claims, negotiations or complex,\nprotracted litigation. Intellectual property disputes and litigation, regardless of merit, can be costly and disruptive to our business operations by diverting attention\nand energies of management and key technical personnel, and by increasing our costs of doing business. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating\nresults.\n19\nWe may be subject to claims that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others, especially in light of the\nheightened pace of adoption of new technologies in our industry and the multiple additional technologies that we have been acquiring.\nOur products and technology, including technology that we acquire as a result of our ongoing acquisitions of other businesses and technology that we license\nfrom others, about which we may be less knowledgeable that our organically developed technology, may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the\nintellectual property rights of third parties. This risk is especially relevant to our industry, where the pace of innovation and adoption of new technologies by\nindustry players has been accelerated in recent years. Patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time until\nthey are published, and the publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months or more. As a result, the\nnature of claims contained in unpublished patent filings around the world is unknown to us, and we cannot be certain that we or our acquired companies were the\nfirst to conceive inventions covered by our self-developed or our acquired patents or patent applications or that we or our acquired companies were the first to file\npatent applications covering such inventions. Furthermore, it is not possible to know in which countries patent holders may choose to extend their filings under the\nPatent Cooperation Treaty or other mechanisms. In addition, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from individuals, vendors and other\ncompanies, including those that have acquired patents in the fields of 3D printing or consumable production for the sole purpose of asserting claims against us.\nUnder the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, we may also be subject to royalty claims for “service inventions” conceived by employees in the\ncourse and as a result of or arising from their employment with us. Section 134 of the Patent Law provides that if there is no agreement between an employer and\nan employee as to whether the employee is entitled to consideration for service inventions, the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, or the Committee, a\nbody constituted under the Patent Law, shall determine these issues. We believe that virtually all of our employees have executed invention assignment agreements\nin which they have assigned to us their rights to potential inventions and acknowledged that they will not be entitled to additional compensation or royalties from\ncommercialization of inventions. We may, nevertheless, face claims demanding remuneration in consideration for assigned inventions.\nIn addition to patent infringement and patent-related claims, we may be subject to other intellectual property claims, such as claims that we are infringing\ntrademarks or misappropriating trade secrets. We may also be subject to claims relating to the content on our websites, including third-party content posted on our\nGrabCAD.com website. Any intellectual property claims, regardless of the merit or resolution of such claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in\nresponding to, defending and resolving such claims, and may prohibit or otherwise impair our ability to commercialize new or existing products, including\nproducts developed by our acquired companies. Resolution of such claims may, among other things, require us to redesign infringing technology, enter into costly\nsettlement or license agreements on terms that are unfavorable to us, pay royalties to employees or former employees, or indemnify our distributors and end-users.\nAny infringement by us, including our acquired companies, or our licensors of the intellectual property rights of third parties may have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets or know-how, such proprietary information may be used by others to compete against us, for\ninstance, in developing consumables that could be used with our printing systems in place of our proprietary consumables.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our technology, trade secrets, know-how and other unregistered proprietary rights. While we enter\ninto confidentiality and invention assignment agreements intended to protect such rights, such agreements can be difficult and costly to enforce or may not provide\nadequate remedies if violated, and we may not have entered into such agreements with all relevant parties. Such agreements may be breached and confidential\ninformation may be willfully or unintentionally disclosed, including by employees who may leave our company and join our competitors, or our competitors or\nother parties may learn of the information in some other way. The disclosure to, or independent development by, a competitor of any of our trade secrets, know-\nhow or other technology not protected by a patent or other intellectual property system could materially reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage that we\nmay have over such competitor.\n20\nThis concern could manifest itself in particular with respect to our proprietary consumables that are used with our systems. Portions of our proprietary\nconsumables may not be afforded patent protection. Chemical companies or other producers of raw materials used in our consumables may be able to develop\nconsumables that are compatible to a large extent with our systems, whether independently or in contravention of our trade secret rights and related proprietary and\ncontractual rights. If such consumables are made available to owners of our systems, and are purchased in place of our proprietary consumables, our revenues and\nprofitability would be reduced and we could be forced to reduce prices for our proprietary consumables.\nAs our patents expire, additional competitors using our technology could enter the market, which could offer competitive printers and consumables, require us\nto reduce our prices for our products and result in lost sales.\nSome of our patents have expired and others will expire in coming years. Upon expiration of those patents, our competitors have introduced, and are likely to\ncontinue to introduce, products using the technology previously protected by the expired patents, which products may have lower prices than those of our products.\nTo compete, we may need to reduce our prices for those products, which would adversely affect our revenues, margins and profitability. Additionally, the\nexpiration of our patents could reduce barriers to entry into AM systems, which could result in the reduction of our sales and earnings potential.\nRisks related to operations in Israel\nThe recent attack by Hamas and other terrorist organizations from the Gaza Strip and Israel’s war against them and its hostilities with additional regional\nterrorist groups may adversely affect our operations.\nIn October 2023, Israel was attacked by Hamas and other terrorist organizations operating out of the Gaza Strip and declared war in response. As part of the\nwar, Israel has also had hostilities with Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist group. Our senior executives, some of our board members and some of our employees live\nin Israel. A small group of our employees have been called for military service, and such persons may be unavailable for extended periods of time. Our operations\nmay be disrupted by such absence, which, if involving several senior executives or board members (although not currently the case) may materially affect our\noperations in an adverse manner. In the event that our facilities are damaged as a result of hostile actions, or hostilities otherwise disrupt our ongoing operations,\nour ability to deliver or provide products and services in a timely manner to meet our contractual obligations towards customers and vendors could be affected.\nCurrently, our activities in Israel remain largely unaffected, and we maintain business continuity plans backed by our inventory levels located outside of Israel.\nAs of the date herein, the impact of the war on our results of operations and financial condition is not material, but such impact may increase, and could become\nmaterial, as a result of the continuation, escalation or expansion of the war.\n21\nOur Israeli headquarters and manufacturing and other significant operations may be adversely affected by military economic and political, instability in\nIsrael.\nOne of our dual corporate headquarters, as well as our PolyJet system manufacturing facility, all of our PolyJet research and development facilities, one of our\ntwo PolyJet consumables manufacturing facilities, one of our FDM manufacturing facilities, and some of our suppliers, are located in central and southern Israel.\nIn addition, many of our key employees, officers and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, military, economic and political conditions in Israel may\ndirectly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring\ncountries, and between Israel and nearby terrorist groups. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its trading\npartners could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Currently, and several additional times over the past two decades, Israel has been engaged in\narmed conflicts with Hamas, a terrorist group and political party that has controlled the Gaza Strip, and currently (to a more limited extent) and during the summer\nof 2006, Israel has been engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite terrorist group and political party. These conflicts have involved\nmissile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, including areas where some of our manufacturing facilities are located, and negatively affected\nbusiness conditions in Israel. Armed conflicts, terrorist activities and political instability in the region, including Iranian involvement in Syria, have, to a certain\nextent, adversely affected business conditions and could harm our results of operations and our ability to raise capital. Parties with whom we have agreements\ninvolving performance in Israel may claim that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions\nin such agreements due to the political or security situation in Israel.\nFurthermore, many of our male employees in Israel, including members of our senior management, are obligated to perform one month, and in some cases\nlonger periods, of annual military reserve duty until they reach certain ages, and, in the event of a military conflict such as the current war, have been, and may\nagain be, called to active duty. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of Israeli employees or of one or more of our key Israeli\nemployees who may be called to active duty due to the current (or any future) military conflict. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business and\noperations.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of the current war or any other event associated with the security situation in the\nMiddle East. Although the Israeli government is currently committed to covering the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or\nacts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained, or if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate us fully for damages\nincurred. Any losses or damages incurred by our Israeli operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The current (and any future) armed\nconflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect business conditions generally and harm our results of operations.\n22\nYour rights and responsibilities as a shareholder will be governed by Israeli law, which may differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of\nshareholders of U.S. companies.\nWe are organized under Israeli law. The rights and responsibilities of the holders of our ordinary shares are governed by our amended and restated articles of\nassociation and Israeli law. These rights and responsibilities differ in some respects from the rights and responsibilities of shareholders in typical U.S.-based\ncorporations. In particular, a shareholder of an Israeli company has a duty to act in good faith toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from\nabusing its power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders on matters such as amendments to a company’s\narticles of association, increases in a company’s authorized share capital, mergers and acquisitions and interested party transactions requiring shareholder approval.\nIn addition, a shareholder who knows that it possesses the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or to appoint or prevent the appointment of a\ndirector or executive officer in the company has a duty of fairness toward the company. There is limited case law available to assist us in understanding the\nimplications of these provisions that govern shareholders’ actions. These provisions may be interpreted to impose additional obligations and liabilities on holders\nof our ordinary shares that are not typically imposed on shareholders of U.S. corporations.\nProvisions of Israeli law may delay, prevent or otherwise impede a merger with, or an acquisition of, our company, which could prevent a change of control,\neven when the terms of such a transaction are favorable to us and our shareholders.\nIsraeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions\ninvolving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to such types of transactions. For example, a merger may\nnot be consummated unless at least 50 days have passed from the date on which a merger proposal is filed by each merging company with the Israel Registrar of\nCompanies and at least 30 days have passed from the date on which the shareholders of both merging companies have approved the merger. In addition, a majority\nof each class of securities of the target company must approve a merger. Moreover, a tender offer for all of a company’s issued and outstanding shares can only be\ncompleted if the acquirer receives positive responses from the holders of at least 95% of the issued share capital. Completion of the tender offer also requires\napproval of a majority of the offerees that do not have a personal interest in the tender offer, unless, following consummation of the tender offer, the acquirer would\nhold at least 98% of the company’s outstanding shares.\nFurthermore, the shareholders, including those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer, may, at any time within six months following the completion\nof the tender offer, petition an Israeli court to alter the consideration for the acquisition, unless the acquirer stipulated in its tender offer that a shareholder that\naccepts the offer may not seek such appraisal rights.\nFurthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to us or to our shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax\ntreaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax. For example, Israeli tax law does not recognize tax-free share exchanges to the same extent as U.S.\ntax law. With respect to mergers, Israeli tax law allows for tax deferral in certain circumstances but makes the deferral contingent on the fulfillment of a number of\nconditions, including a holding period of two years from the date of the transaction during which sales and dispositions of shares of the participating companies are\nsubject to certain restrictions.\nMoreover, with respect to certain share swap transactions, the tax deferral is limited in time, and when such time expires, the tax becomes payable even if no\ndisposition of the shares has occurred.\nThese and other similar provisions could delay, prevent or impede an acquisition of our company or our merger with another company, even if such an\nacquisition or merger would be beneficial to us or to our shareholders.\n23\nExchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the New Israeli Shekel, the Euro and other non-U.S. currencies may negatively affect the earnings of\nour operations.\nWe report our financial results and most of our revenues are recorded in U.S. dollars. However, substantially all of the manufacturing, research and development\nexpenses of our Israeli operations, as well as a portion of the cost of revenues, selling and marketing, and general and administrative expenses of our Israeli\noperations, are incurred in New Israeli Shekels. As a result, we are exposed to exchange rate risks that may adversely affect our financial results. If the New Israeli\nShekel appreciates against the U.S. dollar or if the value of the New Israeli Shekel declines against the U.S. dollar at a time when the rate of inflation in the cost of\nIsraeli goods and services exceeds the rate of decline in the relative value of the New Israeli Shekel, then the U.S. dollar cost of our operations in Israel would\nincrease and our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nDuring 2023, the value of the New Israeli Shekel decreased significantly relative to the U.S. dollar during most of the year and settled at a level that was near the\nall-time low, before rising somewhat in late 2023, after market conditions stabilized in Israel in the midst of Israel’s war against the terrorist organization Hamas.\nThe weakening of the New Israeli Shekel relative to the U.S. dollar had a positive impact upon our dollar-denominated financial results, due to the relative\ndecrease in cost of the New Israeli Shekel denominated expenses of our Israeli operations. That positive impact, however, may have been short-lived, and the New\nIsraeli Shekel could strengthen significantly once again relative to the U.S. dollar if Israel successfully completes its war against Hamas and experiences renewed\neconomic growth, which may increase the U.S. dollar cost of our New Israeli Shekel denominated Israeli expenses once again. Our results of operations could be\nadversely affected if we are unable to effectively hedge against currency fluctuations in the future. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation or\ndeflation in Israel or the rate of appreciation or devaluation of the New Israeli Shekel against the U.S. dollar. The Israeli annual rate of inflation amounted to 3.0%,\n5.3%, and 2.8% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The annual appreciation (devaluation) of the New Israeli Shekel in relation\nto the U.S. dollar amounted to (2.4%), (13.2%) and 3.3% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe also have substantial revenues and expenses that are denominated in non-US currencies other than the New Israeli Shekel, particularly the Euro. Therefore,\nour operating results and cash flows are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and those foreign currencies. These\nfluctuations could negatively affect our operating results and could cause our revenues and net income or loss to vary from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, to the\nextent that our revenues increase in regions such as Asia Pacific, where our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, a strengthening of the dollar against other\ncurrencies could make our products less competitive in those foreign markets and collection of receivables more difficult.\nFrom time to time we engage in currency hedging activities. These measures, however, may not adequately protect us from material adverse effects due to the\nimpact of inflation in Israel or from fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies in which we transact business, and may result\nin a financial loss. For further information, please see “Item 11. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this annual report.\nCalculating our income tax rate is complex and subject to uncertainty. We are currently eligible for Israeli government tax benefits in respect of our Israeli\noperations. If we do not meet several conditions for receipt of those benefits, or if the Israeli government otherwise decides to eliminate those benefits, they\nmay be terminated or reduced, which would impact our income tax rate and increase our costs.\nThe computation of income taxes is complex because it is based on the laws of numerous taxing jurisdictions and requires significant judgment on the\napplication of complicated rules governing accounting for tax provisions under GAAP. Income taxes for interim quarters are based on a forecast of our effective\ntax rate for the year, which includes forward-looking financial projections. Such financial projections are based on numerous assumptions, including the\nexpectations of profit and loss by jurisdiction. It is difficult to accurately forecast various items that make up the projections, and such items may be treated as\ndiscrete accounting. Examples of items that could cause variability in our income tax rate include our mix of income by jurisdiction, changes in our uncertain tax\npositions, the application of transfer pricing rules, and tax audits.\n24\nFuture events, such as changes in our business and the tax law in the jurisdictions where we do business, could also affect our rate.\nOne important assumption that goes into calculation of our tax rate is the tax benefit that we are eligible for in respect of some of our operations in Israel,\nreferred to as “Approved Enterprise”, “Beneficiary Enterprise”, “Preferred Enterprise” and/or “Preferred Technology Enterprise” (as applicable), under the Law for\nthe Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959, or the Investment Law. Based on an evaluation of the relevant factors under the Investment Law, including\nthe level of foreign (that is, non-Israeli) investment in our company, we have estimated that our average effective tax rate to be paid with respect to all profit from\nthe Israeli operations under these benefit programs is 7.5% to 15%, based on the current balance of activity between our Rehovot, Israel and Kiryat Gat, Israel\nfacilities and the available level of benefits under the law. If we do not meet the requirements for maintaining these benefits, they may be reduced or cancelled and\nthe relevant operations would be subject to Israeli corporate tax at the standard rate, which for 2018 and onwards is set at 23%. In addition to being subject to the\nstandard corporate tax rate, we would be required to refund any tax benefits that we have already received as adjusted by the Israeli consumer price index, plus\ninterest or other monetary penalties. Even if we continue to meet the relevant requirements, the tax benefits that we are eligible for may not be continued in the\nfuture at their current levels or at all. If these tax benefits were reduced or eliminated, the amount of taxes that we pay would likely increase, as all of our\noperations would consequently be subject to corporate tax at the standard rate, which may cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than our estimates\nand could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if we increase our activities outside of Israel, for example, via acquisitions, our increased\nactivities may not be eligible for inclusion in Israeli tax benefit programs, and that could also adversely affect our effective tax rate and our results of operations.\nThe Israeli government may furthermore independently determine to reduce, phase out or eliminate entirely the benefit programs under the Investment Law,\nregardless of whether we then qualify for benefits under those programs at the time, which would also adversely affect our effective tax rate and our results of\noperations.\nWe received Israeli governmental grants for certain of our research and development activities. The terms of those grants may require us, in addition to\npayment of royalties, to satisfy specified conditions in order to manufacture products and transfer technologies outside of Israel, including increase of the\namount of our liabilities in connection with such grants. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the Innovation Law (as defined below), we may be\nrequired to pay penalties in addition to repayment of the grants, and may impair our ability to sell our technology outside of Israel.\nSome of our research and development efforts were and are financed in part, through grants that we received from the Israeli Innovation Authority, to which we\nrefer as the IIA or the Authority (formerly operating as Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Economy of the State of Israel, or the OCS). Since 2007 and\nthrough December 31, 2023, we have received funding from the Authority of approximately $9 million, in the aggregate, under several R&D programs to support\ncertain research and development projects in Israel. In addition, we have received funding from the Europe authorities of approximately $1.8 million, to support\ncertain projects in Europe.\nWe must comply with the requirements of the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law, 5744-1984 and\nrelated regulations rules, procedures and benefit tracks collectively or the “Innovation Law”.\nWhen a company develops know-how, technology or products using grants provided by the Authority, the terms of these grants and the Innovation Law restrict\nthe transfer of such know-how, and the transfer of manufacturing or manufacturing rights of such products, technologies or know-how outside of Israel.\n25\nUnder the Innovation Law and the regulations thereunder, a recipient of royalty-bearing grants from the IIA is required to return the grants by the payment of\nroyalties of 3% to 5% on the revenues generated from the sale of products (and related services) developed (in whole or in part) under the IIA program up to the\ntotal amount of the grants received from the IIA; Those obligations are linked to the U.S. dollar. Pursuant to the latest IIA regulations, grants received from the IIA\nbefore June 30, 2017, bear an annual interest rate that applied at the time of the approval of the applicable IIA file, and that interest rate will apply to all of the\nfunding received under that IIA approval. Grants received from the IIA after June 30, 2017, bear an annual interest rate based on the 12-month London Interbank\nOffered Rate, or LIBOR, until December 31, 2023, and as of January 1, 2024, bear an annual interest rate based on the 12-month Secured Overnight Financing\nRate, or the SOFR, or at an alternative rate published by the Bank of Israel, with the addition of 0.71513%. Grants approved after January 1, 2024, will bear the\nhigher of (i) the 12 months SOFR interest rate, plus 1%, or (ii) a fixed annual interest rate of 4%.\n• Transfer of IIA funded know-how outside of Israel. Any transfer of the know-how that was developed with the funding of the Authority and related\nintellectual property rights, outside of Israel, including by way of license for research and development purpose requires prior approval of the Authority\nand imposes certain conditions, including, requirement of payment of a redemption fee calculated according to the formula provided in the Innovation Law\nwhich takes into account, among others, the consideration for such know-how paid to us in the transaction in which the technology is transferred, research\nand development expenses, the amount of IIA grants, the time of completion of IIA supported research project and other factors, while the redemption fee\nwill not exceed 600% of the grants amount plus interest. No assurance can be given that approval to any such transfer, if requested, will be granted and\nwhat will be the amount of the redemption fee payable.\n• Transfer of IIA funded know-how and related intellectual property rights to an Israeli company requires a pre-approval by IIA and may be granted if the\nrecipient undertakes to fulfil all the liabilities to IIA and undertakes to abide by the provisions of Innovation Law, including the restrictions on the transfer\nof know-how and the manufacturing rights outside of Israel and the obligation to pay royalties (note that there will be an obligation to pay royalties to IIA\nfrom the income received by us in connection with such transfer transaction as part of the royalty payment obligation). No assurance can be given that\napproval to any such transfer, if requested, will be granted.\n• Local manufacturing obligation. The terms of the grants under the Innovation Law require that the manufacturing of products resulting from Authority-\nfunded programs be carried out in Israel, unless a prior written approval of the Authority is obtained (except for a transfer of up to 10% of the production\nrights, for which a notification to the Authority is sufficient). As a condition for obtaining approval to manufacture outside Israel, we would be required to\npay increased royalties, which usually amount to 1% in addition to the standard royalties rate, and also the total amount of our liability to IIA may be\nincreased to between 120% and 300% of the grants we received from IIA, depending on the manufacturing volume that is performed outside Israel (less\nroyalties already paid to IIA). This restriction may impair our ability to outsource manufacturing rights abroad, however, it does not restrict export of our\nproducts that incorporate IIA funded know-how.\n• A company also has the option of declaring in its IIA grant application for funding its intention to exercise a portion of the manufacturing capacity abroad,\nthus avoiding the need to obtain additional approval for such declared funding. Such declaration may affect the increase in the total liability to the IIA\nfollowing such manufacturing abroad.\n• The restrictions under the Innovation Law (such as with respect to transfer of manufacturing rights abroad or the transfer of IIA funded know-how and\nrelated intellectual property rights abroad) will continue to apply even our liabilities are repaid to IIA in full and will cease to exist only upon payment of\nthe redemption fee described above.\n26\nFurthermore, in the event that we undertake a transaction involving the transfer to a non-Israeli entity of technology developed with IIA funding pursuant to a\nmerger or similar transaction, the consideration available to our shareholders may be reduced by the amounts we may be required to pay to IIA. Any approval, if\ngiven, will generally be subject to additional financial obligations to the IIA. Failure to comply with the requirements under the Innovation Law may subject us to\nmandatory repayment of grants received by us (together with interest and penalties), as well as expose us to criminal proceedings.\nIn May 2017, IIA issued new rules for licensing know how developed with IIA funding outside of Israel, or the Licensing Rules, allowing us to enter into\nlicensing arrangements or grant other rights in know-how developed under IIA programs outside of Israel, subject to the prior consent of IIA and payment of\nlicense fees to IIA, calculated in accordance with the Licensing Rules. The payment of the license fees will not discharge us from the obligations to pay royalties or\nother payments to IIA.\n• Certain reporting obligations. We, as any recipient of a grant or a benefit under the Innovation Law, are required to file reports on the progress of activities\nfor which the grant was provided as well as on our revenues from know-how and products funded by the Authority. In addition, we are required to notify\nthe Authority of certain events detailed in the Innovation Law.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a U.S. judgment against us and our officers and directors in Israel or the United States, or to serve process on our officers and\ndirectors.\nWe are organized in Israel. Most of our officers and most of our directors (as of December 31, 2023) reside outside of the United States, and a majority of our\nassets are located outside of the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us or any of our executive officers and directors in the United States,\nincluding one based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not be enforced by an\nIsraeli court. It also may be difficult for you to effect service of process on these persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original\nactions instituted in Israel.\nRisks related to an investment in our ordinary shares\nThe market price of our ordinary shares may be subject to fluctuation, regardless of our operating results and financial condition. As a result, our\nshareholders could incur substantial losses.\nThe market price of our ordinary shares since the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger has been subject to substantial fluctuation. From the start of 2020 through the\nearly part of 2024 (through February 24, 2024), our ordinary shares have traded with closing prices that have ranged from $10.02 to $54.37, which low and high\nprices were each recorded since the start of 2021, evidencing a trend towards greater share price fluctuations. During 2023, in particular, our share price was\nsubject to frequent movements based on developments regarding potential merger and acquisition, and hostile takeover, activities involving our company. The\nprice of our ordinary shares may continue to be subject to substantial fluctuation regardless of our operating results or financial condition due to a number of\nfactors, including:\n• the extent of growth of the 3D printing market generally;\n• changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n• developments regarding potential friendly or hostile merger, acquisition or takeover activities involving our company and other companies in the 3D\nprinting industry, including Nano and 3D Systems;\n• development of new competitive systems and services by others;\n• success or failure of research and development projects of our company or our competitors;\n• developments concerning our or our competitors’ intellectual property rights;\n• successes or failures of the acquisitions or dispositions that we consummate, as perceived by financial or industry analysts;\n• the general tendency towards volatility in the market prices of shares of technology companies; and\n27\n• general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares and result in substantial\nlosses being incurred by our shareholders.\nMarket prices for securities of technology companies historically have been very volatile. The market for these securities has from time to time experienced\nsignificant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of any one company. In the past, following periods of market\nvolatility, public company shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation, as was the case in February and March, 2015, when class actions of\nour shareholders, alleging violations of the Exchange Act, were initiated against the Company and certain of our officers as defendants. Any such additional\nsecurities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.\nRaising additional capital by issuing securities or issuing securities pursuant to acquisitions of other companies or technologies may cause dilution to our\nshareholders, and may furthermore be difficult under certain market conditions.\nWe may need or desire to raise substantial capital in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, among others:\n• the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies(as we did in acquiring Origin in December 2020, RPS in February\n2021,Xaar in November 2021, Riven in 2022, and Covestro AG in April 2023) and other strategic relationships;\n• our degree of success in capturing a larger portion of additive manufacturing demand;\n• the costs of establishing or acquiring sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our products;\n• the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our issued patents and defending intellectual property-related\nclaims; and\n• the costs of financing unanticipated working capital requirements and responding to competitive pressures.\nIf we raise funds or pay for acquisitions of other entities by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, it will reduce the percentage ownership of our then-\nexisting shareholders, and the holders of such new securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those possessed by our then-existing shareholders.\nThe market price for our ordinary shares, which had declined significantly from its all-time high in periods following the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger and\nhad vacillated in recent years, including in 2023 due to potential merger and acquisition activity, fell in the fourth quarter of 2023 to near all-time lows before\nslowly recovering towards the end of 2023. Should our share price remain at relatively low levels, that would adversely impact our ability to raise funds in the\ncapital markets or to utilize our securities as payment in an acquisition transaction.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, if our share price does not appreciate, our shareholders may not\nrecognize a return, and could potentially suffer a loss, on their investment in our ordinary shares.\nWe intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of\nour ordinary shares will be investors’ sole source of a return on their investment for the foreseeable future.\n28\nEven if we decide to pay dividends on our ordinary shares, we may be restricted from doing so or payment of such dividends may have adverse consequences\nfor our company.\nUnder the Companies Law, dividends may only be paid out of our profits and other surplus funds (as defined in the Companies Law) as of the end of the most\nrecent year or as accrued over a period of the most recent two years, whichever amount is greater, provided that there is no reasonable concern that payment of a\ndividend will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. In the event that we do not meet the profit and surplus funds\ncriteria, we can seek the approval of an Israeli court in order to distribute a dividend. The court may approve our request if it is convinced that there is no\nreasonable concern that the payment of a dividend will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable obligations as they become due. Due to the\nacquisition method of accounting utilized, under GAAP, for the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger and the Origin transaction, pursuant to which we were deemed to\nhave acquired Objet’s assets and Origin's assets, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant annual amounts of amortization expense in respect of those\nassets. We are also subject to the risk of impairment charges from time to time to our acquired assets. These significant annual expenses under GAAP have\nreduced, and may continue to reduce or eliminate, our profits and surplus funds as determined under the Companies Law, and, hence, may restrict our ability to pay\ndividends (absent court approval).\nIn general, the payment of dividends may also be subject to Israeli withholding taxes. In addition, because we receive certain benefits under the Israeli law\nrelating to “Approved Enterprise” and “Beneficiary Enterprise”, our payment of dividends (out of tax-exempt income) may subject us to certain Israeli taxes to\nwhich we would not otherwise be subject. See “Risks related to our operations in Israel—The government tax benefits that we currently receive require us to meet\nseveral conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which would increase our costs.”\nWe are a foreign private issuer under the rules and regulations of the SEC and are therefore exempt from a number of rules under the Exchange Act and are\npermitted to file less information with the SEC than a domestic U.S. reporting company, which will reduce the level and amount of disclosure that you receive.\nAs a foreign private issuer under the Exchange Act, we are exempt from certain rules under the Exchange Act, including the proxy rules, which impose certain\ndisclosure and procedural requirements for proxy solicitations. Moreover, we are not required to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as\nfrequently or as promptly as domestic U.S. companies with securities registered under the Exchange Act; and are not required to comply with Regulation FD,\nwhich imposes certain restrictions on the selective disclosure of material information. In addition, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt\nfrom the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules under the Exchange Act with respect to their\npurchases and sales of our ordinary shares. Accordingly, you receive less information about our company and trading in our shares by our affiliates than you would\nreceive about a domestic U.S. company, and are afforded less protection under the U.S. federal securities laws than you would be afforded in holding securities of a\ndomestic U.S. company.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are also permitted, and have begun, to follow certain home country corporate governance practices instead of those otherwise\nrequired under the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market for domestic U.S. issuers. We have informed Nasdaq that we follow home country practice in Israel\nwith regard to, among other things, director nomination procedure and approval of compensation of officers. In addition, we have opted to follow home country\nlaw instead of the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market that require that a listed company obtain shareholder approval for certain dilutive events, such as the\nestablishment or amendment of certain equity- based compensation plans, an issuance that will result in a change of control of the company, certain transactions\nother than a public offering involving issuances of a 20% or greater interest in the company, and certain acquisitions of the stock or assets of another company.\nFollowing our home country governance practices as opposed to the requirements that would otherwise apply to a United States company listed on The Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market may provide our shareholders with less protection than they would have as shareholders of a domestic U.S. company.\n29\nOur status as a foreign private issuer is subject to an annual review and test, and will be tested again as of June 30, 2024 (the last business day of our second\nfiscal quarter of 2023). If we lose our status as a foreign private issuer, we will no longer be exempt from such rules. Among other things, beginning on December\n31, 2024, we would be required to file periodic reports and financial statements on a periodic basis (including both an annual report in respect of 2024 and\nquarterly reports in respect of each of the quarters of 2025) as if we were a company incorporated in the U.S., which, among other things, would result in increased\ncompliance and reporting costs to us.\nIf we are classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences.\nGenerally, if for any taxable year, after applying certain look-through rules, 75% or more of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of\nour assets are held for the production of, or produce, passive income, we may be characterized as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Passive income for\nthis purpose generally includes, among other things, certain dividends, interest, royalties, rents and gains from commodities and securities transactions and from\nthe sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income. If we are a PFIC, gain realized by a U.S. shareholder on the sale of our ordinary shares may be\ntaxed as ordinary income (rather than as capital gain income), and an interest charge added to the tax. Rules similar to those applicable to the taxation of gains\nrealized on the disposition of our stock would apply to distributions exceeding certain thresholds.\nAlthough we do not believe that we were a PFIC in 2023, we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with that conclusion or that we will not become a PFIC\nin 2024 or in a subsequent year. The tests for determining PFIC status are applied annually, and it is difficult to make accurate predictions of our future income and\nthe future value of our assets. U.S. shareholders should consult with their own U.S. tax advisors with respect to the U.S. tax consequences of investing in our\nordinary shares. For a discussion of how we might be characterized as a PFIC and related tax consequences, please see Item 10.E, “Additional Information-\nTaxation-U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations- Tax Consequences if We Are a Passive Foreign Investment Company”.\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. History and Development of the Company\nOur legal and commercial name is Stratasys Ltd., and we are the product of the 2012 merger of two leading additive manufacturing companies, Stratasys, Inc.\nand Objet Ltd. Stratasys, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1989, and Objet Ltd. was incorporated in Israel in 1998. As part of that merger transaction, the\nordinary shares of Stratasys Ltd. were listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “SSYS”. We have acquired (and, in certain cases,\ndisposed of) a number of companies since that time. In July 2014 and August 2014, we acquired Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies, respectively two\nleading providers of additive manufacturing services. Following those two acquisitions, in 2015, we introduced our branded Stratasys Direct Manufacturing, or\nSDM, service, which significantly broadened and increased our production and offering of AM parts, which are used by our customers as prototypes, benchmarks\nand end-use parts. In December, 2020, we acquired 3D printing start-up, Origin Inc., or Origin, and its proprietary P3 Programmable PhotoPolymerization\ntechnology, which has become an important growth engine for our company. The acquisition was aimed at fortifying our leadership in polymers and production\napplications of 3D printing in industries such as dental, medical, tooling, and select industrial, defense, and consumer goods markets. In February 2021, we\nacquired UK-based RP Support Ltd., or RPS, a provider of industrial stereolithography 3D printers and solutions. RPS’ complementary technology further expands\nour polymer suite of solutions across the product life cycle, from concept modeling to manufacturing. In April 2021, we introduced the Stratasys H350 3D printer,\nthe first system powered by the powder-based SAF™ technology of Xaar 3D Ltd., or Xaar, and in November 2021, we acquired\n30\nall remaining shares of Xaar from Xaar plc (we previously owned a 45% share in Xaar), thereby accelerating our growth in production-scale 3D printing. In\nSeptember 2022, we disposed of our subsidiary MakerBot, a leader in desktop 3D printing, merging it with UltiMarker, after which transaction we hold a 46.5%\nequity interest in the combined company, which aims to provide easy-to-use and accessible 3D printing hardware, software, and materials for any application. In\nOctober 2022, we acquired the assets of the quality- assurance software company Riven and integrated its cloud-based software solution into our GrabCAD®\nadditive manufacturing platform, which enables manufacturing customers to adopt our solutions for end-use parts production. (and which itself had been acquired\nby us in September 2014). We completed, in April 2023, the acquisition of the additive manufacturing materials business of Covestro AG, which has expanded our\ndifferentiated materials offerings in stereolithography, digital light processing (DLP), and powders. We furthermore expect to effect smaller acquisitions and\ninvestments in other companies from time to time to support execution of our strategy.\nWe have dual headquarters. Our registered office and one of our two principal places of business is located at 1 Holtzman Street, Science Park, P.O. Box 2496,\nRehovot 76124, Israel, and our telephone number at that office is (+972)-74-745-4314. Our other principal place of business is located at 7665 Commerce Way,\nEden Prairie, Minnesota, and our telephone number there is (952) 937-3000. Our agent in the United States is Richard Garrity, Chief Industrial Business Unit\nOfficer of our Delaware subsidiary, Stratasys, Inc., whose address is c/o Stratasys, Inc. at the address of our Eden Prairie, Minnesota headquarters. Our web\naddress is www.stratasys.com. The information contained on that website (or on our other websites, including stratasysdirect.com and makerbot.com) is not a part\nof this annual report. As an Israeli company, we operate under the provisions of the Companies Law.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, our capital expenditures amounted to $15.0 million, $19.8 million and $26.8 million, respectively, of which $13.6 million,$13.6\nmillion and $25.0 million, respectively, was principally related to the purchase and construction of property, plant and equipment.\nIn 2022 and 2021, we had capital expenditures related to our facility in Rehovot, Israel, which we own, and where our Israeli headquarters have been situated\nsince January 2017. This relatively new facility, towards which we paid $0.2 million and $11.1 million during 2022 and 2021 respectively, also houses research and\ndevelopment facilities. In 2023 we didn't have any capital expenditure related to the new facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had invested an aggregate of\n$119.5 million in our new facility in Israel and its related equipment.\nDuring 2023, we made other purchases of property and equipment, mainly for the enhancement of our manufacturing capabilities to support new solution\nofferings, primarily for our facilities in Israel and the United States.\nDuring 2023, one of our shareholders, Nano Dimension Ltd., or Nano, launched a hostile, unsolicited tender offer pursuant to which it offered to acquire (based\non the last amendment to the offer) up to 25,266,458 of our outstanding ordinary shares which, together with ordinary shares that it already owned, would have\nprovided it with a 51% interest in our outstanding ordinary shares. The offer (as last amended) was subject to Nano’s holding at least 46% of our outstanding\nordinary shares upon consummation of the offer, and to at least 5% of our outstanding ordinary shares being tendered by our other shareholders in the offer. The\noffer was launched on May 25, 2023 at a price of $18.00 per share (at which point the offer was for Nano to achieve between 53% and 55% ownership of our\ncompany upon consummation). The offer was amended to prices of $20.05, $24.00, and $25.00 per share on June 27, 2023, July 10, 2023 and July 18, 2023,\nrespectively (accompanied by a reduction in the number of shares offered to purchase and in the percentage ownership of our ordinary shares to be held by Nano\nupon consummation to between 46% and 51%). The offer expired, after multiple extensions, on July 31, 2023. None of our ordinary shares were purchased\npursuant to Nano’s tender offer, as there were insufficient acceptances to meet the minimum conditions of the offer.\n31\nB. Business overview\nWe are a global leader in polymer-based 3D printing solutions, which we provide at every stage of the product life cycle, with multiple technologies and\ncomplete solutions for superior application fit, across industrial, healthcare and consumer fields. We focus, in particular, on polymer 3D printing solutions that\naddress the fastest- growing manufacturing solutions, which we view as the biggest potential growth opportunity in the 3D printing industry. Leveraging distinct\ncompetitive advantages that include a broad set of best-in-class 3D printing platforms, software, materials and technology partner ecosystems, innovative\nleadership, and a global GTM infrastructure, we are positioned to further expand our leadership in this significant and growing global marketplace.\nOur approximately 2,600 granted and pending additive technology patents currently held (in addition to many others previously held) have been used to create\nmodels, prototypes, manufacturing tools, and production parts for a multitude of industries including aerospace, automotive, transportation, healthcare, consumer\nproducts, dental, medical, fashion and education. Our products and comprehensive solutions improve product quality, development time, cost, time-to-market and\npatient care. Our additive manufacturing ecosystem of solutions and expertise includes materials, software, expert services, and on-demand parts production.\nOur acquisition, of Origin, a provider of photopolymer solutions for production-oriented applications, expanded our leadership through innovation in the fast-\ngrowing mass production parts segment by providing us with a next-generation photopolymer platform. Origin’s pioneering approach to additive manufacturing of\nend-use parts enables us to serve a large market with manufacturing-grade 3D printers, utilizing P3™ Programmable PhotoPolymerization technology. This\ntechnology precisely controls light, heat, and force, among other variables, to produce parts with exceptional accuracy and consistency and enables a broad range\nof chemistry which turns into unique production grade properties.\nOur acquisition of RPS, which closed in February 2021, has enabled us to leverage RPS’ industry-leading go-to-market infrastructure to offer their Neo® line of\nsystems to the global market with an expanded set of applications. Our Neo line of 3D printers feature dynamic laser beam technology that enables build accuracy,\nfeature detail, and low variability across the full extent of a large build platform. As an open resin system, the Neo products provide customers materials with a\nwide range of properties such as chemical resistance, heat tolerance, flexibility, durability, and optical clarity, and can produce large parts up to 800 x 800 x 600\nmm, providing a significant build area in a small footprint.\nOur acquisition, in November 2021, of the remaining outstanding shares of Xaar that we had not already owned (we had held a 45% stake in Xaar) was aimed at\naccelerating our growth in production-scale 3D printing. In April 2021, we introduced the Stratasys H350™ 3D printer, the first system powered by Xaar’s\npowder-based SAF™ technology. Representing the culmination of more than 10 years of research and development, SAF-based 3D printers are designed to deliver\ncost-competitive parts at production-level throughput. H Series™ Production Platform printers such as the H350 are designed to deliver part quality, consistency,\nand reliability that ensures customer satisfaction and high production yield. Using SAF technology, the printers execute key 3D printing steps in the same direction\nacross the print bed to provide a uniform thermal experience – and therefore part consistency – for all printed parts regardless of their placement in the build,\nrepresenting a significant improvement over traditional powder-bed fusion processes\nIn April 2023, we purchased the assets of Covestro’s AM materials business, including all of the SOMOS™ portfolio. The materials, IP portfolio, and talent we\nacquired from Covestro will help us address new applications in key technology categories such as stereolithography, P3/DLP, and powder bed fusion, including\nSAF™ technology.\nWe now offer a broader range of systems, consumables and services for additive manufacturing. Our wide range of solutions, based on our proprietary 3D\nprinting technologies and materials, enhances the ability of designers, engineers and manufacturers to:\n• visualize and communicate product ideas and designs;\n32\n• verify the form, fit and function of prototypes;\n• manufacture tools, jigs, fixtures, casts and injection molds used in the process of manufacturing end-products;\n• manufacture customized and short-to-medium-run end-products more efficiently, with greater agility, and more sustainably; and\n• produce objects that could not otherwise be manufactured through subtractive manufacturing methodologies.\nOur goal is to be the first choice for polymer 3D printing. Given our significant experience and proven operating history, we have many competitive advantages\nincluding:\n• Versatile offering of innovative technologies.-We offer five different 3D printing technology platforms, each of which has been optimized for specific\nindustry applications, which provides us with a versatile, deep offering for end users within the 3D printing industry They are complemented by a\ntechnology-agnostic software platform, with an extensive and rapidly expanding ecosystem of software solutions and software partners for workflow and\nconnectivity, as well as a robust range of advanced materials.\n• Expansive materials ecosystem.- To ensure maximum performance and quality, as well as access to the broadest possible range of materials for our\ncustomers, we provide a robust range of materials in three distinct tiers: (i) Stratasys Preferred, which are engineered by us or our third-party material\npartners exclusively to provide the best combination of material and printer performance; (ii) Stratasys Validated, which are engineered by us or our third-\nparty materials partners and validated by us with basic reliability testing to accelerate the expansion of material options available in the marketplace; and\n(iii) Open: Unvalidated materials accessed via an OpenAM Software License, which may offer unique attributes and the potential to address new\napplications but have not received validation testing or optimization relative to performance and functionality on a Stratasys printer. Our acquisition of\nCovestro in April 2023 has further strengthened our differentiated materials offering in stereolithography, DLP, and powders, which additional materials\nare supported by a broad portfolio of patents.\n• Deep application engineering expertise- We believe we have the most industry application engineers in the world who provide our deep quality and process\ncertification expertise for tier-1 manufacturing OEMs. This is essential for meeting the rigorous demands of industries like aerospace, where there are over\n500,000 Stratasys parts already flying around the world today, or healthcare, where we support multiple materials for biocompatible applications. We have\nmulti-industry experience with multiple 3D printing technologies serving the aerospace, defense, automotive, industrial, dental, consumer, education, and\nmedical industries.\n• Unparalleled market access. We believe our network of over 130 resellers and value added channel partners is the strongest and most experienced in the\nindustry, covering every region and every major market. This network of resellers worldwide is exclusive to us and our technologies, and has been built\nover many years, making it unable to be quickly and easily duplicated. This channel network has focused primarily on selling and servicing our FDM and\nPolyJet solutions since the merger of Stratasys and Objet in 2012, and starting in 2021, included the Origin P3, SAF, and Neo stereolithography\ntechnologies, which dramatically expand the total addressable market across medical, dental, consumer goods, automotive, commercial goods, and service\nbureaus.\n• Marquee customer base- Many of the world’s leading companies across aerospace, technology, automotive, consumer, energy, and healthcare are our\nstrategic partners. These include: General Motors, whose new multi-million-dollar additive manufacturing facility in Michigan features Stratasys systems\nfrom low to high end; TE Connectivity, which is now using Origin One 3D printers to produce end use parts for aerospace connectivity; Airbus, which\nrecently extended Stratasys’ contract to include several more aircraft platforms as well as spare parts production; and the U.S. Army, which signed an\n33\napproximate $8 million contract with Stratasys in 2023 for a purchase that included systems from all five Stratasys platforms, given the distinct capabilities\nof each platform to address varying applications.\n• Software/Digital manufacturing connectivity- Through our GrabCAD Additive Manufacturing Platform, we have created a smart and connected software\necosystem to enable additive manufacturing at scale across the digital thread, from design through production. Our SDKs integrate with many different\nsoftware partner solutions, allowing customers to turn data into intelligence by collecting important information that can be used to improve productivity.\nThis level of integration expands the capabilities of 3D printers. In addition, many of our 3D printing systems are software-upgradable. As our largest\ncustomers increasingly adopt multiple Stratasys systems across multiple 3D printing technologies, the efficiency benefits of a single software platform to\nmanage them increases.\nWe benefit from recurring revenues from the sale of resin and plastic consumables and related services. We provide products and services to our global\ncustomer base throughout our offices in North America and internationally, including: Baden-Baden, Germany; Shanghai, China; and Tokyo, Japan, as well as\nthrough our worldwide network of over 130 resellers and channel partners who are exclusive to us and our additive manufacturing technologies. We have\napproximately 1,980 employees worldwide, including what we believe is one of the largest additive manufacturing service bureaus in the United States.\nIndustry overview\nHistorically, prototype development and customized manufacturing have been performed by traditional methods using metal extrusion, computer-controlled\nmachining, and manual modeling techniques, in which blocks of material are carved or milled into specific objects. These subtractive manufacturing\nmethodologies have numerous limitations. They often require heavy involvement of specialist technicians and can be time- and labor-intensive, and traditional\nmolds for injection molding are expensive. The time intensity of traditional modeling can leave little room for design error or subsequent redesign without\nmeaningfully impacting a product’s time-to-market and development cost. As a result, prototypes have traditionally been created only at selected milestones late in\nthe design process, which prevents designers from truly visualizing and verifying the design and geometry of an object in the preliminary design stage. The\ninability to iterate a design rapidly hinders collaboration among design team members and other stakeholders and reduces the ability to optimize a design, as time-\nto-market and optimization become necessary trade-offs in the design process.\n3D printing addresses many of the inherent limitations of traditional modeling technologies through its combination of functionality, quality, ease of use, speed\nand cost. 3D printing can be significantly more efficient and effective than traditional model-making techniques for use across the design process, from concept\nmodeling and design review and validation, to fit and function prototyping, pattern making and tooling, to direct manufacturing of repeatable, cost-effective parts,\nshort-run parts and customized end products. Introducing 3D modeling earlier in the design process to evaluate fit, form and function can result in faster time-to-\nmarket and lower product development costs, while keeping intellectual property in-house. As the 3D printing industry is maturing, its role in a product’s lifecycle\nis further expanding, specifically into manufacturing solutions that follow the initial modeling and prototyping stages of the product lifecycle. This evolution opens\na substantially larger total addressable market for additive manufacturing solutions.\nIn the medical industry as well, practitioners are rapidly embracing the cutting-edge production of 3D printed anatomical models for pre-operative procedural\nplanning. 3D printed pre-procedural models are low-cost and are customized to individual patients. Created from medical scans, the printed models provide\nphysicians the opportunity to map out their procedures in a no-risk surgical setting. The rapidly produced and quickly delivered models assist with procedure\nvalidation, ultimately improving patient outcomes.\n34\nFor short and medium-run manufacturing, 3D printers eliminate the need for complex manufacturing set-ups and reduce the cost and lead-time associated with\nconventional tooling. Direct digital manufacturing, or DDM, involves the use of 3D production systems for the direct manufacture of parts that are subsequently\nincorporated into the user’s end product or manufacturing process. DDM is particularly attractive in applications that require shorter-run or lower-volume parts or\nrapid turn-around, and for which tooling would not be appropriate due to small volumes.\nIncreasingly, attention is being paid to the potential sustainability benefits of additive manufacturing as well. By producing parts on-site and at scale, carbon\nemissions associated with transportation and delivery can be reduced. Additive manufacturing also reduces waste because the right number of products are created\nat the right time. One study has suggested that additive manufacturing could reduce industrial energy use by 2050. Light-weighting parts through additively\ndesigned polymer components save airlines fuel. – about 14,000 gallons of fuel per year per plane for every pound eliminated.\nNew technologies, such as our P3 and SAF technologies, are beginning to significantly increase the volumes at which additive manufacturing is competitively\nadvantageous up to tens of thousands and beyond in some cases. DDM also enables the production of objects that have been topologically designed, or designed on\nthe basis of a computerized determination of where to place the key components of the object and how to connect them, a process that is generally unavailable\nusing conventional subtractive manufacturing methodologies.\nDesktop 3D printer usage has shown rapid growth in recent years, with the introduction and adoption of affordable entry-level 3D printers and increased\navailability and content. These entry-level desktop printers have increased market adoption by professional designers and education institutions. We expect that the\nadoption of desktop 3D printing will continue to increase in the future, in terms of design applications and engineering applications. We believe that the expansion\nof the market will be spurred by increased proliferation of 3D content and 3D authoring tools (3D computer-aided-design, or CAD, and other simplified 3D\nauthoring tools), as well as increased availability of 3D scanners. We also believe that increased adoption of 3D printing will be facilitated by continued\nimprovements in 3D printing technology and greater affordability of entry-level systems. We are active in facilitating the growth of the desktop 3D printing market\nby way of our investment in Ultimaker, a company created from the merger of our former subsidiary MakerBot with Ultimaker into a new combined desktop 3D\nprinting market leader.\nStratasys solutions\nRange of solutions\nWe provide integrated solutions throughout the production cycle for designers, engineers, manufacturers, and medical professionals, including compatible\nproducts and services designed for our customers’ use to effectively solve their specific application needs. Our solutions consist of 3D printing systems,\nconsumables, software, paid parts, and professional services and encompass everything from prototyping and design all the way through mass production.\nOur solutions allow our end-users to print 3D models and parts that enhance their ability to visualize, verify and communicate product designs, thereby\nimproving the design, development and validation processes and reducing time-to-market. Our systems create visual aids for concept modeling and functional\nprototyping to test fit, form and function, permitting rapid evaluation of product designs. Using presentation models developed with our systems, designers and\nengineers can typically conduct design reviews and identify potential design flaws earlier in the process and make improvements before incurring significant costs\ndue to re-tooling and rework, allowing them to optimize a design much more rapidly and cost-effectively.\n35\nOur systems aid in the communication of ideas otherwise communicated in abstract or 2D media. For example, physicians use visually and/or biomechanically\naccurate 3D printed Stratasys models to plan surgical procedures. A model produced with our systems may be used as a sales tool, as a model or part display, or\nsimply for use in conducting a focus group. It may also be used for accelerated collaboration in product design and manufacturing cycles at multiple locations,\nenabling visualization and tactile response, which can be critical to product development or sales process.\nOur solutions also empower end-users to quickly and efficiently deploy parts to incorporate into their manufacturing process and improve its effectiveness while\nat the same time lowering costs. For instance, our solutions enable the production of manufacturing aids and tools such as jigs, fixtures, casts and injection molds\naiding in the production and assembly process. These solutions are often faster to produce than through traditional methods, and frequently cost less. Materials like\nnylon carbon fiber enable these printed products to be both exceptionally strong and lightweight.\nAdditive manufacturing of end-use-parts, using our solutions, is a growing focus of our offerings to customers, and is attractive in applications requiring fast,\nshort-run or low-mid-volume parts where tooling would not be cost-efficient. Our solutions enable the production of objects that generally could not otherwise be\nmanufactured through subtractive manufacturing methodologies.\nIn addition, our solutions enable doctors to train and plan medical procedures based on medical models, created by our printers, as well as create surgical guides\nto support complex surgeries. In the dental space, our PolyJet solutions enable dental labs to create dental and orthodontic, patient specific models and guides,\nincluding permanent dentures and temporary crowns and bridges, as well as devices for various applications, based on digital dentistry workflow.\nOur solutions offerings are characterized by the following distinguishing qualities:\n• material properties of printed objects, such as heat resistance, toughness, brittleness, elongation-to-break, color and flexibility;\n• quality of printed objects measured by, among other things, resolution, accuracy and surface quality;\n• consistency of produced parts in a run or batch;\n• multiple production-grade modeling materials;\n• reliability of printing systems;\n• fast time to part;\n• efficiency of operations with software workflows;\n• customer service;\n• ease of use; and\n• automatic, hands-free support removal and minimal post processing.\nRange of technologies and differentiating factors\nOur solutions are driven by our proprietary technologies, which we have both developed organically and acquired over time through targeted acquisitions. We hold\napproximately 2,600 patents and pending patents internationally, and our 3D printing systems utilize our patented extrusion-based FDM®,inkjet-based PolyJet™,\npowder- bed-based SAF®, photopolymer-based P3™, and stereolithography technologies to enable the production of prototypes, tools used for production, and\nmanufactured goods directly from 3D CAD files or other 3D content. We believe that our broad range of product and service offerings is a function of our 3D\nprinting technology leadership.\n36\nFDM. A key attribute of our FDM® 3D printing technology is its ability to use a variety of production grade thermoplastic materials featuring surface\nresolution, chemical and heat resistance, color, and mechanical properties necessary for production of functional prototypes and parts for a variety of industries\nwith specific demands and requirements. Use of these materials also enables the production of highly durable end parts and objects with soluble cores for the\nmanufacture of hollow parts, the manufacture of which were previously dependent on slower and more expensive subtractive manufacturing technologies.\nWe believe this technology is differentiated by factors making it appropriate for 3D printing and additive manufacturing, including:\n• ability to use FDM® systems in an office environment due to the absence of hazardous emissions;\n• low post-production processing requirements;\n• minimal material waste;\n• build repeatability;\n• ease of use, with minimal system set-up requirements;\n• absence of costly replacement lasers and laser parts; and\n• a high degree of precision and reliability.\nPolyJet. We believe that our inkjet-based 3D printing technology is differentiated from other competing technologies in its ability to scale and deliver high-\nresolution and multi-material, full-color 3D printing, down to the voxel level, in an office environment system. Our easy-to-use PolyJet™ 3D printers create high-\nresolution, smooth surface finish models with the look, feel and functionality of the final designed product. We offer a wide variety of office-friendly resin\nconsumables, including rigid and flexible (rubber-like) materials, materials for medical applications that simulate the biomechanical properties of human tissue,\nand bio-compatible materials for dental applications. Using our PolyJet digital materials technology, our solutions offer unique quality 3D printing systems\ndepositing multiple materials simultaneously. This enables users, in a single build process, to print parts, assemblies, and composite materials made of multiple\nmaterials-each retaining its distinct mechanical and physical properties. For example, users can print objects with both rigid and flexible portions in a single build\nor mix different base colors to achieve a desired color tone. The PolyJet technology enables on-demand mixing of a variety of resins to create a broad range of pre-\ndefined digital materials, which are composite materials with modified physical or mechanical and color properties. This includes ‘Pantone® Validated’ colors,\nallowing us to support more than 600,000 color and texture combinations, including the industry’s clearest material, nearly as clear as glass, with a wide range of\ncolor and texture combinations, which is a key differentiating attribute of our 3D printers. In 2022, we began offering tailored PolyJet solutions with 3DFashion™\ntechnology designed specifically for end-use apparel applications. In 2023, we began offering FDA-cleared PolyJet-based dental parts such as dentures, crowns\nand bridges parts through our TrueDent resin.\nStereolithography. Our stereolithography technology enables the production of high-quality, durable parts that meet the requirements of a wide range of\napplications, as well as additive manufacturing prototypes and tools. Industrial stereolithography systems are well-established in the 3D printing industry for\napplications such as large prototypes, tooling, investment casting patterns, and orthodontic clear aligner molds. They provide quality surface finish, large build\nsizes, a fast time to print, and an affordable cost per part. We believe that the Neo line of systems (acquired via RPS in February 2021) is superior relative to other\nsolutions currently available due to an open choice of resins, system reliability, low service requirements, simple day-to-day operation, and accurate builds. With\naccess to our strong global channels, we believe we can bring these benefits to many more manufacturing organizations. Our latest acquisition of the Covestro\nAdditive Manufacturing business unit in April 2023 completed our stereolithography offering with the strong Somos® materials portfolio for stereolithography\nprinters. Somos materials are widely known and appreciated for their mechanical properties, printing performance, high quality, and repeatable builds. These\nmaterials with our Neo systems offering will provide an attractive and differentiated offering over the current stereolithography solutions in the market.\n37\nP3. Our P3 resin-based 3D printing technology, which we added to our solutions portfolio through our acquisition of Origin, provides a best-in-class\ncombination of detail, mechanical properties and throughput for mass production parts. We believe we have the strongest materials portfolio in the category -\nincluding everything from aerospace-grade flame-resistant materials to biocompatible materials from leading companies like BASF, Henkel and Covestro. The P3\nplatform is software-based and cloud-connected so we can easily optimize our platform for our customers, including cloud-based upgrades. In October, we\nannounced that the P3 printers can now use our GrabCAD Print software, which simplifies 3D printing workflows and brings a more consistent user experience\nacross our technologies. Recently, we have also demonstrated automated large-scale production using our P3 technology together with post-processing units. We\nbelieve that such differentiated solutions, with the unique P3 platform and strong materials portfolio, will support wide adoption of the technology in the market by\nindustrial production customers.\nSAF. SAF Selective Absorption Fusion technology was developed via our joint venture with Xaar plc, Xaar 3D Ltd., which we acquired in 2021.SAF is an\nindustrial-grade additive manufacturing technology designed to deliver production-level throughput for end-use parts. Representing the culmination of more than\n10 years of research and development, SAF-based 3D printers can deliver a competitive cost per part with the part quality, consistency, and reliability that ensures\nsatisfaction and high production yield. The SAF technology uses a counter-rotating roller to coat powder bed layers onto a print bed and prints absorber fluid to\nimage the part layers. The imaged layers are fused by passing an infrared lamp over the entire span of the print bed. SAF technology executes these key process\nsteps in the same direction across the print bed to provide a uniform thermal experience - and therefore part consistency - for all printed parts regardless of their\nplacement in the build. H Series™ 3D printers use SAF materials developed by leading third party materials providers, including PA11, which is derived from\nsustainable castor oil, and PA12, which is stiffer than PA11 and is ideal for applications where rigidity is important. We also plan to develop SAF materials\ninternally as a result our acquisition of Covestro Additive Manufacturing.\nWe believe that the range of 3D printing consumable materials, together with the broad set of materials in our materials ecosystem, that we offer, is the widest in\nthe industry.

In order to do so, we regularly update the technical documentation related to our\nsystems, offer extensive training courses for operators and promote proactive knowledge sharing designed to help users maximize the value of their equipment and\nto expand the applications for which they employ our 3D printing and production systems.\nWe offer services on a time and materials basis, as well as a full range of post-warranty maintenance contracts with varying levels of support and pricing, as\ndescribed below under “Extended support programs.” Customer support is represented on cross-functional product development teams within our company to\nensure that products are designed for serviceability and to provide our internal design and engineering departments with feedback on field issues. Failure analysis,\ncorrective action, and continuation engineering efforts are driven by data collected in the field. Ongoing customer support initiatives include the development of\nadvanced diagnostic and troubleshooting techniques and comprehensive preventative maintenance programs, an expanded training and certification program for\nStratasys and Stratasys partners’ technical personnel, and improved communication between the field and the factory.\nBasic warranty\nOur printing systems are sold with warranties that range from 90 days to, typically, one year from installation, depending upon the product line and geographic\nlocation.\nWarranties are typically accompanied by on-site maintenance support. Receipt of maintenance and repair services after the warranty period is subject to the\nterms of our extended support programs, to the extent purchased by the end-user, as described below.\nExtended support programs\nRecognizing that our end-users have varying support needs, we offer a range of support programs that enable our end-users to continue to receive maintenance\nservices beyond the initial warranty period. These support programs contain varying degrees of the support services described above and are priced accordingly.\nAs part of our support programs, in light of our being subject to FDA regulation with respect to our first certified medical device with TrueDent resin, we have\nin place suitable processes to support customer complaints under the FDA’s standards.\nLeasing and other services\nWe have arrangements, in certain countries, in which third-party financial institutions independently provide lease financing directly to our customers, on a non-\nrecourse basis to the Company. In these arrangements, we sell and transfer title of the equipment to these financial institutions. Generally, we have no continuing\nownership rights in the equipment subsequent to its sale. In addition, we provide pay-per-usage subscription services for our 3D printers and 3D production\nsystems via partners in our global manufacturing network. The revenues generated from such program were insignificant.\nWe also offer a ‘Try and Buy’ program, which provides businesses the ability to try out a 3D printer prior to deciding whether or not it’s the right fit for their\ncompany.\nThe potential purchasers of a 3D printer receive customer support from our company during the trial period.\n50\nStratasys Direct Manufacturing paid-parts service\nStratasys Direct Manufacturing is a contract manufacturing service provider of parts on-demand via polymer 3D printing processes.

No single customer or group of affiliated customers nor any individual sales agent or group of affiliated sales agents accounted for\nmore than 10% of our sales in 2023, 2022, or 2021. Our solutions are used across a wide array of applications in a variety of different industries.\nMarketing, sales and distribution\nMarketing\nOur marketing strategies are tailored to achieve several key objectives. These include elevating awareness and establishing thought leadership in our solutions\nand product areas, and solidifying our leadership brand position across multiple industries, including automotive, aerospace, medical, dental, fashion, education,\nand consumer goods. Furthermore, we are committed to expediting and enhancing sales growth while enhancing customer loyalty and lifetime value.\nTo attain these goals, we execute a multifaceted approach that encompasses thought leadership initiatives, relations with industry analysts, and impactful\nproduct launches. Integrated campaigns serve to deepen connections with our existing customer base while expanding our reach to attract new clients. This\napproach stimulates demand and generates leads across our strategic markets, encompassing both our direct operations and our extensive network of resellers.\nOur marketing arsenal combines inbound and outbound strategies for maximum impact. Inbound tactics leverage digital platforms, including blogs, social\nmedia, search engine optimization (SEO), search engine marketing (SEM), and engaging webinars and white papers to nurture leads. On the outbound front, we\ndeploy digital and print communication campaigns, execute public relations efforts, initiate direct mail and email outreach, host virtual and in-person tradeshows\nand roadshows, and orchestrate thought leadership events. We maintain an active presence in newsletters, industry associations, and leverage referrals to bolster\nour engagement.\nAdditionally, our regional offices across the globe house state-of-the-art product and technology demonstration facilities, reinforcing our commitment to\nshowcasing our solutions effectively.\nOur resellers are integral to our success, and we prioritize their growth by providing essential tools and support. We offer a comprehensive suite of marketing\nresources, including brochures and product guides, and extend co-marketing opportunities to enhance their visibility and drive sales. To ensure their competence in\nmarketing and selling our products, we offer training and education programs.\n51\nWe closely monitor and assess the outcomes of our marketing initiatives, continuously striving to discern evolving customer needs. This analysis informs our\nproduct roadmaps and individual marketing plans, enhancing distribution optimization and facilitating seamless product release, ramp-up, and sales processes.\nSales distribution methods\nOur sales organization sells, distributes and provides follow-up support services with respect to our AM systems and related consumables, through a worldwide\nsales and marketing infrastructure. We generally use two methods for distribution and support: (i) sales to resellers who purchase and resell our products (including\nmaterials) and through whom follow-up support and maintenance services and replacement parts are provided to end-users; and (ii) direct sales of systems or\nservices to end-users without the involvement of any intermediaries, for which all aspects of our sales and follow-up services are handled exclusively by our\ncompany. Our resellers are overseen by regional managers and some resellers operate on a non-exclusive basis, although we believe that most do not sell\ncompeting AM systems.\nAlmost all of the reseller locations that distribute our products have our AM systems available for tradeshows, product demonstrations, and other promotional\nactivities. Additionally, many of them enjoy a long-term presence and offer third-party 3D CAD software packages in their respective territories, enabling them to\ncross-sell our systems to customers who purchase those other products.\nIn addition to traditional direct sales and reseller-based sales of our AM systems and related consumables, we also utilize an online customer/partner digital hub\nwhich serves as a direct digital method for distribution of our products. The online hub acts as a point of sale for consumables, software and spare parts to end-\nusers who own our systems.\nGeographic structure of sales organization\nThe primary sales organization for our 3D printers and production systems including related consumables, materials and services is divided into groups based\non the following geographical regions: Americas; Europe and Middle East; APAC. This structure allows us to align our sales and marketing resources with our\ndiverse customer base. Our sales organization in each region provides sales support to the network of independent reseller and sales agent locations throughout the\nparticular region. We also operate sales and service centers in various locations throughout the Americas and internationally, including: Baden-Baden, Germany;\nShanghai, China; and Tokyo, Japan.\nManufacturing and suppliers\nManufacturing\nThe manufacturing process for our 3D printing and production FDM, PolyJet, stereolithography (or SLA), and P3 (digital light printing) technology systems\nconsists of assembling those systems using both off-the-shelf and customized components manufactured specifically for us and producing and packaging the\nconsumables products to be used by those systems. Our core competencies include FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP systems assembly and integration, software\ninstallation and resin and filament manufacturing. The majority of those activities are done internally at our facilities. We currently operate on a build-to-forecast\nbasis and obtain all parts used in the FDM and PolyJet systems manufacturing process from either distributors of standard electrical or mechanical parts or custom\nfabricators of our proprietary designs. Our manufacturers and suppliers are periodically assessed by us based on their on-time performance and quality.\nWe purchase major component parts for our FDM, PolyJet SLA and DLP systems from various suppliers, subcontractors and other sources, and test those parts\nin our U.S., Israeli and U.K facilities.\n52\nComputer-based Material Requirements Planning, or MRP, is used for reordering to better ensure on-time delivery of parts and raw materials. Operators and\nassemblers are trained on assembly and test procedures including Assembly Requirement Documents, which originate in engineering. In the manufacturing\nprocesses for our FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP systems, and for our consumables, we employ a Quality Management System, or QMS, that meets international\nquality standards including ISO 9001:2008 and ISO 13485:2003, in the case of medical devices. We also outsource the manufacturing of main subassemblies up to\nfully assembled systems ready for integration.\nThe system assembly process for our FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP systems includes semi-automated functional tests of key subassemblies. Key functional\ncharacteristics are verified through these tests, and the results are stored in a statistical database.\nUpon completion of the assembly of our 3D printing and production FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP systems, we perform a complete power up and final quality\ntests to help ensure the quality of those products before shipment to customers. The final quality tests must be run error-free before the FDM, PolyJet, SLA and\nDLP systems can be cleared for shipment. We maintain a history log of all FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP products that shows revision level configuration and a\ncomplete history during the manufacturing and test process. All identified issues on the FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP systems during the manufacturing process are\nlogged, tracked and used to make continuous production process improvements. The commonality of designs among our different FDM, PolyJet, SLA and DLP\nproduct families eases the transition to manufacturing new designs.\nOur filament production have used Factory Physics® techniques to manage critical buffers of time, capacity and inventory to ensure product availability. We\nalso use the “5S” method (Sort, Set-in-order, Shine, Standardize and Sustain) and a continuous improvement system as part of our lean manufacturing initiatives to\nimprove organization and efficiency.\nInventory and suppliers\nWe maintain an inventory of parts to facilitate the timely assembly of products required by our production plan. While most components are available from\nmultiple suppliers, certain components used in our systems and consumables are only available from single or limited sources. In particular, the printer heads for\nour PolyJet 3D printing systems are supplied by a sole supplier, Ricoh. We consider our single and limited-source suppliers (including Ricoh) to be reliable, but the\nloss of one of these suppliers could result in the delay of the manufacture and delivery of the relevant components (and, ultimately, of our products). This type of\ndelay could require us to find and re-qualify the component supplied by one or more new vendors. Although we consider our relationships with our suppliers to be\ngood, we continue to develop risk management plans for these critical suppliers. In order to hedge against the risk of a discontinuation of the supply of our inkjet\nprinter heads in particular, we maintain a reasonable supply of excess inventory of printer heads.\nRicoh Agreement\nWe purchase the printer heads for our inkjet 3D printing systems from Ricoh pursuant to an OEM Purchase and License Agreement with Ricoh, or the Ricoh\nAgreement.\nUnder the Ricoh Agreement, we place orders for print heads and associated electronic components, or the Ricoh Products. Together with provision of these\nitems, Ricoh provides us with a non-transferable, non-exclusive right to assemble, use and sell the Ricoh Products under Ricoh’s patent rights and trade secrets.\nPricing under the Ricoh Agreement depends on the quantity of Ricoh Products that we purchase during any given month, and to the extent that we commit to a\ncertain annual minimum prior to an upcoming year, we receive a set, discounted price for all Ricoh Products ordered during that upcoming year.\n53\nThe Ricoh Agreement ran for an initial term of five years (which we renewed in September 2016) and automatically renews for additional one-year periods\nthereafter unless either party provides the other six months’ advance written notice of termination prior to the end of the then-current term. The Ricoh Agreement\nmay be cancelled by either party if (i) the other party substantially breaches any material provision of the agreement and has not cured such breach within 30 days\nof receipt of written notice thereof, or (ii) upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events, and may furthermore be cancelled by Ricoh if we fail to cure a breach\nof an undisputed payment obligation within thirty (30) days of the breach.\nAt any time during the term of the Ricoh Agreement, Ricoh may discontinue the manufacture and supply of a print head model, so long as it provides us with at\nleast eighteen (18) months’ prior written notice of such discontinuance and honors all of our purchase orders for the subject print head model within the notice\nperiod. During the period of five years from the earlier of either the termination of the Ricoh Agreement or the date of discontinuance of the manufacture of Ricoh\nProducts (that is, following the 18-month notice period described in the previous sentence), we are entitled to purchase additional Ricoh Products for the sole\npurpose of providing replacements for the installed base of Ricoh Products, including one final purchase order that we may place in the final year of such five-year\nperiod and that must be filled by Ricoh within twelve months of when it is placed.\nThe Ricoh Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the other party’s prior written consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld.\nResearch and development\nWe maintain an ongoing program of research and development, or R&D, to develop new systems and materials and to enhance our existing product lines, as\nwell as to improve and expand the capabilities of our systems and related software and materials. This includes significant technology platform developments for\nour FDM, PolyJet, P3, SAF and SLA technologies, our AM systems, including our integrated software,3 our family of proprietary acrylic-based photopolymer\nmaterials for PolyJet, SL and P3 technologies, and our family of proprietary thermoplastic materials for FDM printing. Our research aims to develop both\nincremental and disruptive improvements, as well as more affordable products. Our engineering development efforts also focus on customer requested\nenhancements, and development of new modeling processes, software and user applications. In particular, we have devoted significant time and resources to the\ndevelopment of a universally compatible and user-friendly software system.\nOur R&D department is divided into groups based on scientific disciplines and product lines. We continue to standardize our product platforms, leveraging each\nnew design so that it will result in multiple product offerings that are developed faster and at reduced expense.\nWe invest a significant amount of our resources in R&D, because we believe that superior technology is a key to maintaining a leading market position. Our net\nR&D expenses were approximately $94.4 million, $92.9 million and $88.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our\nconsumable materials development and production operations for our FDM, PolyJet, P3, SLA and SAF systems are located at our facilities in Eden Prairie,\nMinnesota; Rehovot, Israel; Kiryat Gat, Israel; Elgin, Illinois; Geleen, Netherlands; and Lengwil, Switzerland. We regard the consumable materials formulation\nand manufacturing process as a trade secret and hold patent claims related to these products. We purchase and formulate raw materials for our consumables\nproduction from various polymer resin and thermoplastic materials suppliers with different levels of processing and value-add applied to the raw materials.\n54\nIntellectual property\nWe consider our proprietary technology to be important to the development, manufacture, and sale of our products and seek to protect such technology through\na combination of patents, trade secrets, and confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our employees, consultants, customers and others.\nAll patents and patent applications for additive manufacturing processes and apparatuses associated with our technology were assigned to us by those inventors.\nThe principal granted patents relate to our FDM systems, our PolyJet technologies, our 3D printing processes and our consumables, certain of which have already\nexpired and certain of which have expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2039.\nWe are also a party to various licenses and other arrangements that allow us to practice and improve our technology under a broad range of patents, patent\napplications and other intellectual property, including a cross-license agreement with 3D Systems Corporation under which each party licensed certain patents of\nthe other party, an assignment of rights to us related to UV polymer-based U.S. patents, which underlie certain technologies that compete with ours, and a patent\nlicense agreement with Cornell University providing access to certain tool changer patents.\nIn addition, we own certain registered trademarks and make use of a number of additional registered and unregistered trademarks, including “Stratasys”, the\nStratasys Signet logo, “Objet”, “PolyJet”, “Connex”, ”J8 Series”, “J850”, “J826”, “J750”, “J700”, “J5”, “J35”, “J55”, “Vero”, “VeroFlex,” “VeroEco,”\n“VeroUltra”, “VeroVivid”, “Tango”, “Durus”, “Rigur”, “Elastico”, “TrueDent”, “FDM”, “Fortus”, “F123 Series”, “F370”, “F900”, “F770”, “Insight”, “Antero”,\n“Diran”, “Origin”, “Origin One”, “P3”, “Stratasys Direct Manufacturing”, “Stratasys Direct”, “GrabCAD”, “GrabCAD Community”, “GrabCAD Print”,\n“GrabCAD Shop”, “GrabCAD Steamline”, “OpenAM”, “ProtectAM”, “DentaJet”, Medijet”, “Digital Anatomy”, “TissueMatrix”, “GelMatrix”, “BoneMatrix”,\n“RadioMatrix”, “3DFashion”, “TechStyle”, “FabriX”, “Neo”, “Neo800”, “Neo450”, “Titanium”, “Titanium Assistant”, “H350”, “H Series”, “SAF”, “Big Wave”,\n“Selective Absorption Fusion”, “Somos”, “WaterClear”, “WaterShed”, “PerFORM”, “Addigy”, “Mindful Manufacturing”, “3D Printing a Better Tomorrow” and\n“Make additive work for you”.\nWe believe that, while our patents provide us with a competitive advantage, our success depends on our marketing, business development, applications know-\nhow and ongoing research and development efforts, in addition to our rights under granted and pending patents. Accordingly, we believe that the expiration of any\nsingle patent, or the failure of any of single patent application to result in an issued patent, would not be material to our business or financial position. In any event,\nthere can be no assurance that our patents or other intellectual property rights will afford us a meaningful competitive advantage. Please see the risk factor related\nto the expiration of our patents in “Item 3.D Risk Factors-Risks related to our intellectual property.”\nCompetition\nOur principal competitors consist of other developers of additive manufacturing systems as well as other companies that use fused deposition modeling or\ninkjet-based or vat polymerization or digital light processing (DLP) or power bed fusion technologies to compete in additive manufacturing.\nThe companies that offer these technologies to compete with us include, inter alia, 3D Systems Corporation, EOS GmbH, HP, Carbon, Inc.,Formlabs,\nMarkforged, Inc. and Desktop Metal (following their acquisition of EnvisionTEC).\nThese technologies, which compete for additive manufacturing users, possess various competitive advantages and disadvantages relative to one another within\nthe key categories upon which competition centers, including resolution, accuracy, surface quality, variety and properties of the materials they use and produce,\ncapacity, speed, color, transparency, the ability to print multiple materials and others. Due to these multiple categories, end-users usually make purchasing\ndecisions as to which technology to choose based on the characteristics that they value most. This decision is often application specific. The competitive\nenvironment that has developed is therefore intense and dynamic, as players often position their technologies to capture demand in various verticals\nsimultaneously.\n55\nWe are positioned to compete in our industry mainly on the following bases, which we view as competitive strengths:\n• material properties of printed objects, such as heat resistance, toughness, brittleness, elongation-to-break, color and flexibility;\n• quality of printed objects measured by, among other things, resolution, accuracy and surface quality;\n• multiple production-grade modeling materials;\n• our offering of the best multi-color, multi-material 3D printing systems in the market;\n• reliability and repeatability of our printing systems;\n• ease of use, including of one-step automated modeling process.\n• automatic, hands-free support removal;\n• high level of customer service; and\n• deep application domain know-how and expert services, including among our channel network.\nWe offer a wide range of systems with varying features, capacities and price points. We believe that this enables us to compete with the other additive\nmanufacturing technologies for a wide range of customers with a variety of applications and goals for their additive manufacturing.\nWe also compete with companies that use traditional prototype development and customized manufacturing technologies, and we expect future competition to\narise from the development of new technologies or techniques.\nSeasonality\nHistorically, our results of operations were subject to seasonal factors. Stronger demand for our products historically occurred in our fourth quarter primarily due to\nour customers’ capital expenditure budget cycles and our sales compensation incentive programs. Our first and third quarters historically were our weakest quarters\nfor overall unit demand. The first quarter was typically a slow quarter for capital expenditures in general. The second quarter was typically when we would see our\nlargest volume of educational related sales, which normally qualified for special discounts as part of our long-term penetration strategy.\nSince prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (ever since 2019), however, our historical seasonality pattern has been disrupted, and we have not seen a steady pattern\nas to the level of demand in the various quarters from year to year.\nWe experience seasonality within individual fiscal quarters, as a substantial percentage of our system sales often occur within the last month of each fiscal\nquarter. This trend has the potential to expose our quarterly or annual operating results to the risk of unexpected, decreased revenues in the case of our inability to\nbuild systems, consummate sales and recognize the accompanying revenues prior to the end of a given quarter.\n56\nGlobal operations\nWe have offices in, among other locations, Brazil, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Korea, India, Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United\nStates, and organize our operations by geographic region, focusing upon the following key regions: the Americas; Europe and Asia Pacific. Our products are\ndistributed in each of these regions, as well as in other parts of the world. Our customers are dispersed geographically, and we are not reliant on any single country\nor region for most of our product sales and services revenues, although 62.1% of our 2023 revenues were generated in the Americas and our Stratasys Direct\nManufacturing printed parts services are primarily based in the United States and therefore reliant on United States customers. A breakdown of our consolidated\nrevenues by geographic markets and by categories of operations (that is system, consumables and services) for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nis provided in “Item 5.A Operating and Financial Review and Prospects- Operating Results.” In maintaining global operations, our business is exposed to risks\ninherent in such operations, including currency fluctuations, market conditions, and inflation in the primary locations in which our operating expenditures are\nincurred. Information on currency exchange risk, market risk, and inflationary risk appears elsewhere in this annual report in “Item 3.D Risk Factors” and in “Item\n11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Risk”.\nEmployees\nThe total number of our full-time equivalent employees, and the distribution of our employees (i) geographically and (ii) within the divisions of our company, in\neach case as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, are set forth in this annual report in “Item 6.D Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Employees”.\nGovernment regulation\nWe are subject to various local, state and federal laws, regulations and agencies that affect businesses generally. These include:\n• regulations promulgated by federal and state environmental and health agencies;\n• foreign environmental regulations, as described under “Environmental, Social and Governance Matters” immediately below;\n• the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration;\n• the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n• laws pertaining to the hiring, treatment, safety and discharge of employees;\n• export control regulations for U.S. made products;\n• Israeli tax regulations, as described under “Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs” below;and\n• CE regulations for the European market.\nEffective as of February 2023, as a result of the launch of our first certified medical device with TrueDent resin in the United States, we are now also subject to\nmedical device regulations, such as the U.S. FDA Code of Federal Regulations.\n57\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Matters\nStratasys is Championing Mindful Manufacturing™, with a commitment to 3D Printing a Better Tomorrow™ for people and the planet\nStratasys is committed to ESG & Sustainability best practices, with a strategy in place to advance the Company by addressing the need for\nongoing Environmental, Social and Governance stewardship.\nToday, the challenges posed by geo-political and economic shifts put pressure on businesses. Stratasys, and its Board of Directors, are committed to achieving\nour success metrics in this complex environment, with the understanding that the definition of a strong sustainable business is broadening.\nWith this understanding, we clearly outlined our mission to improve how parts are made, processes are optimized, and products are delivered so that\nmanufacturing impacts people and our planet in a positive way. Our approach is data-driven and evidence-based, knowing that “what you can’t measure, you can’t\nimprove”.\nIn 2021 Stratasys was a first in its industry to publish a comprehensive ESG & Sustainability report, declaring its environmental, social and governance (ESG)\nstrategy, commitment and activities, based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards for sustainability reporting.\nOur commitment to strategic Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) activity is a cornerstone of our purpose: to empower people to create without limits\nfor an economic, personalized and sustainable world.\nStratasys, with broad input from both employees and customers and the support of our board of directors, prioritized four UN Sustainable Development\nGoals(SDGs) for our company:\n1- Responsible consumption and production\n2- Industry infrastructure and innovation\n3- Climate action\n4- Quality education\nToday, we continue to advance our efforts to promote “Mindful Manufacturing™.” This means driving global growth in additive manufacturing by 3D printing\nin ways that promote a positive social and environmental impact. In particular, 3D printing is uniquely positioned to address pressing climate issues— localizing\nsupply chains to reduce the carbon footprint incurred by air and sea freight, enabling the production of strong but lighter weight parts, and reducing the energy\nrequirements of the production process itself. We are at work with improvement efforts, externally and internally, that bring value around our four UN SDGs and\nour Mindful Manufacturing™ mission.\nEnvironmental\nAs a global leader in polymer additive manufacturing solutions, with the broadest portfolio in the industry, Stratasys is focused on making an impact, across\nindustries. Our efforts in this arena are three-fold:\n(i) We push the industry towards greater sustainability, through awareness, standardization, and shared best practices performing research and setting\nimprovement targets with our peers and customers. As part of this mission, Stratasys become a Founding Member of the Additive Manufacturer Green Trade\nAssociation (AMGTA) in 2021, spearheading the shift to a better understanding and execution of sustainability across the entire Additive Manufacturing eco-\nsystem, and value chain.\n(ii) We target an improved circular economy. This entails advancing the digital processes that support our additive technologies, for manufacturing. We focus\non improved reliability, for less physical iterations; we support digital inventories that can be printed on-demand; we offer naturally sourced printing material. we\nlook to improve the way in which finite natural resources are employed in our printing processes–energy and water; and, we offer recycling options as well.\n58\n(iii) We aim to harness our expertise to drive innovation. This means expanding our roadmap to include products that enable the production of parts that have a\nreduced carbon footprint. Imagine cars running with durable 3D printed parts that weigh 30% less than before and provide the same reliability at the same level of\nquality, which enables production that reduces fuel consumption and emissions of parts, when implemented in machines.\nManufacturing is resource-intensive by nature. It is important to note, however, that 3D printing works in a manner that can be far more environmentally\nfriendly than alternative, traditional production methods. Working with industry leaders in aerospace, automotive, healthcare, fashion and consumer production\ncompanies, Stratasys has the ability to enable our customers to reduce their carbon footprints in a meaningful way. We base our work on data and research and plan\non publishing ‘Life Cycle Inventory’ reports to make the scientific case for greener manufacturing. To this end, we have become a founding member of the\nAdditive Manufacturer Green Trade Association (AMGTA), which promotes the environmental case for the entire 3D printing industry.\nRight now, Stratasys offers Scope 1 & 2 data on its activities – having collected data on our operations and internal consumption with the goal of improvement\nacross our global sites, year-over-year. This includes installing solar panels and beginning to generate renewable energy or our manufacturing sites, for example.\nWe have set our initial baseline (i.e., our initially measured emissions levels from which we seek to only improve), not because regulation and compliance require\nthis, but rather because we believe this is a more meaningful way for our business to make an impact; it is our corporate responsibility to create a world where\nfuture generations can thrive. We seek to continuously expand our monitoring capabilities for environmental, social and governance metrics.\nWe have begun our Scope 3 data collection, and reporting, too. In September 2023, the first Stratasys Lifecyle Analysis report was published, based on a\ncustomer use case and collaboration with Dyloan (D-Bond), of the Pattern Group. The Additive Manufacturing Green Trade Association (AMGTA) commissioned\nthis report prepared by Reeves Insight, entitled “Comparative Analysis: Material Jetting vs. Traditional Methods for Designer Luxury Goods”. It details results\nfollowing a year-long study of the transition to industrial AM from traditional methods of manufacture for a specific application. Key takeaways from the study\ninclude a 24.8% reduction in CO2e emissions, when compared with traditional processes; a 49.9% reduction of stock material across the supply chain, also\nreducing and streamlining related transportation needs; and 50.0% less material in the resulting 3D printed logo component. The study also revealed the savings of\nmore than 300,000 liters of water across the 16,000 components, and a 64.3% reduction in electrical energy consumption.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nAs of 2023, our Israel headquarters and Israel manufacturing locations are certified as ISO 14001 environmental management systems (EMS) compliant. We\nhope to leverage that existing EMS compliance to support the EMS accreditation of our facilities in Rheinmunster, Germany and in Eden Prairie, Minnesota during\nthe first half of 2024, as part of our plans to obtain global ISO certification.\nISO certification demonstrates our commitment to reduce environmental impact, measured by international standards that set out the requirements for more\neffective EMS. Our desire for meaningful impact, yet reduced footprint, is achieved through more efficient use of resources and reduction of waste by\nimplementing renewable energy solutions, water management systems, waste recycling that uses composter, and many others initiatives.\n59\nWe are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and compliance requirements, including (but not limited to) those governing the\nemission and discharge of hazardous materials into ground, air or water; noise emissions; the generation, storage, use, management and disposal of hazardous and\nother waste; the import, export and registration of chemicals; the cleanup of contaminated sites; and the health and safety of our employees. Based on information\navailable to us, we do not expect environmental costs and contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our operations. The operation of our facilities, does,\nhowever, entail certain potential risks in these areas. Significant expenditures could be required in the future to comply with environmental or health and safety\nlaws, regulations or requirements as ESG practices and controls become more prominent. Certain of these compliance requirements are imposed by our customers,\nwho at times require us to be registered with U.S. health or safety regulatory agencies, whether on the federal or state level. Others may be related to ESG reporting\nand rising environmental compliance trends in Europe.\nUnder environmental laws and regulations, we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. In particular,\nin Israel, where we assemble our inkjet-based PolyJet 3D printing systems and manufacture our resin consumables, businesses storing or using certain hazardous\nmaterials, including materials necessary for our Israeli manufacturing process, are required, pursuant to the Israeli Dangerous Substances Law 5753-1993, to obtain\na toxin permit from the Ministry of Environmental Protection. We maintain the effectiveness of two Israeli toxin permits for our respective Israeli sites. Our United\nStates-based facilities, as well, are required to maintain various site permits in compliance with state and local laws and regulations.\nIn the European marketplace, amongst others, electrical and electronic equipment is required to comply with the Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic\nEquipment of the European Union (EU), which aims to prevent waste by encouraging reuse and recycling, and the EU Directive on Restriction of Use of Certain\nHazardous Substances, which restricts the use of various hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products. Our products and certain components of such\nproducts “put on the market” in the EU (whether or not manufactured in the EU) are subject to these directives. Additionally, we are required to comply with\ncertain laws, regulations and directives, including TSCA in the United States, as well as REACH, RoHS and CLP in the EU, governing chemicals. These and\nsimilar laws and regulations require, amongst others, the registration, evaluation, authorization and labeling of certain chemicals that we use and ship.\nSocial\nPer our defined SDG’s, the Stratasys Sustainability commitment extends beyond environmental sustainability. For example, we are proud of our “People First”\napproach to business. We put environmental health and safety (EHS) as a top priority, securing the health and safety of our employees, through clear policies and\nannual training, backed by our EHS data management platform. We also continue to be active members in our local communities, with meaningful Corporate\nSocial Responsibility (CSR) activity around the world. Specifically, we are committed to leveraging the value of 3D printing to benefit our local communities\nthrough meaningful partnerships and personal employee contributions via our global volunteer network. Our main areas of focus are in leveraging Stratasys\ntechnologies in pursuing quality education (according to our commitment to SDG #4) and to advancement in patient care for medical cases. For example, in the\nUS, we leverage our technologies to advance next generation STEM learning initiatives, with tech and robotics enthusiasts via our long-term partnership with\nFIRST aRobotics. We have a robust Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) program, launched in 2021 and are a proud platinum sponsor of Technology, Industry,\nPeople, Economics (TIPE) Women in 3D Printing. We continue to advance an inclusion program to address internal opportunities across all human resource touch\npoints (hiring, learning and development) with a key performance indicator (KPI) that calls for 100% candidate slates that include at least one female and one\nmale, for director and more senior positions.\n60\nWith a global presence, Stratasys is attuned to and supportive of the needs of all citizens of this world. That’s why we initiate our “Stratasys Cares” disaster\nrelief programs to support communities impacted by natural disasters, pandemics and war. We actively supported the Turkish people and our Turkish employees\nand partner network during the devastation that ensued following the 2023 earthquake. We support our people during the Iron Swords War in Israel, as well.\nGovernance\nESG, is strongly rooted in the structure of corporate management practices and the disclosure that creates transparency around them. We also publish a\nstandardized ESG & Sustainability report, available to the public, around all ESG topics defined by the GRI standard and addressed in alignment with a periodic\nmateriality assessment. This is a foundation for our ethical global operations, as the 3D printing company with the largest install base among industry-leading\ncompanies. We have a long-standing Code of Ethics and have also extended our culture and values to our suppliers via a suppliers’ code of conduct. We are\nrequired to report financial data as a public company, yet we extend beyond the minimum obligation and provide more comprehensive quarterly analysis of our\nresults for the market, allowing us to better engage with the broader investment community. We conduct quarterly internal updates for employees and team leaders\nat our company to share business updates openly and share ongoing developments with our global teams.We also publish a standardized ESG & Sustainability\nreport, available to the public, around ESG topics defined by the GRI standard and addressed in alignment with a periodic materiality assessment.\nWe strive for clarity, engagement and care. It is our goal to deliver on our purpose, in everything we do: We live as a corporate body by our values: Innovate; Be\nCustomer First; Aim Higher; Own It; and Make it Together.\nESG Key Performance Indicators\nWe take a data-based approach to our sustainability activity, introducing disclosures, certifications, evidence and research on our value proposition across ESG\nareas of activity. For starters, we set clear KPIs in the area of DE&I (described under “Social” above) that have proven to positively impact our goal of employing\nmore women in management and tech roles, as detailed in our GRI reporting. In addition, we believe in performing the deep work required to manage our\nenterprise as a sustainable one, for generations to come. As such our KPIs call for on-going expansion of our data collection and disclosures (additional shared\ncustomer LifeCycle Analyses, ISO 14001 certification global extension, and product DfE – designed for environment) projects. The emissions KPIs will follow our\nscope 1, 2 and eventually 3 data collection and publications.\nNasdaq Board Diversity Matrix\nCountry of Principal Executive Offices Israel\nForeign Private Issuer Yes\nDisclosure Prohibited under Home Country Law No\nTotal Number of Directors 8\nAs of December 31, 2023 As of December 31, 2022\nFemale Male Female Male\nPart I: Gender Identity\nDirectors 1 7 2 6\nPart II: Demographic Background\nUnderrepresented Individual in Home Country Jurisdiction - - - -\nLGBTQ+ - - - -\nDid Not Disclose Demographic Background - - - -\n61\nIsraeli and Multinational Tax Considerations and Government Programs\nTax regulations also have a material impact on our business, particularly in Israel where we are organized and have one of our headquarters. The following is a\nsummary of certain aspects of the current tax structure applicable to companies in Israel, with special reference to its effect on us (and our operations, in\nparticular). The following also contains a discussion of the Israeli government programs applicable for us. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax\nlegislation that has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, we cannot assure you that the tax authorities or the courts will accept the views\nexpressed in this discussion. This discussion does not address all of the Israeli tax provisions that may be relevant to our Company. For a discussion of the Israeli\ntax consequences related to ownership of our capital stock, please see “Israeli Taxation Considerations” in Item 10.E below.\nGeneral Corporate Tax Structure in Israel\nGenerally, Israeli companies are subject to corporate tax on their taxable income. Since 2018, the corporate tax rate has been 23%. However, the effective tax\nrate payable by a company that derives income from an “Approved Enterprise”, a “Beneficiary Enterprise” or a “Preferred Enterprise”, a “Special Preferred\nEnterprise”, a “Preferred Technology Enterprise” or “Special Preferred Technology Enterprise” as further discussed below, may be considerably lower. See “Law\nfor the Encouragement of Capital Investments” in this Item below. Capital gains derived by an Israeli company are generally subject to the prevailing regular\ncorporate tax rate.\nBesides being subject to the general corporate tax rules in Israel, we have also, from time to time, applied for and received certain grants and tax benefits from,\nand participate in, programs sponsored by the Government of Israel, described below.\nIsraeli Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxation), 1969\nThe Company is an “Industrial Company” as defined by the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxation), 1969, and, as such, is entitled to certain\ntax benefits including accelerated depreciation, deduction of public offering expenses in three equal annual installments and amortization of other intangible\nproperty rights for tax purposes.\nLaw for the Encouragement of Capital Investments\nTax incentives programs which were relevant for the company until financial year 2020\nThe Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments, 5719-1959, to which we refer as the Investment Law, provides certain incentives for capital\ninvestments in a production facility (or other eligible assets). Generally, an investment program that is implemented in accordance with the provisions of the\nInvestment Law, which may be either an “Approved Enterprise”, a “Beneficiary Enterprise” or a “Preferred Enterprise”, a “Special Preferred Enterprise”, a\n“Preferred Technology Enterprise” or “Special Preferred Technology Enterprise”, is entitled to benefits as discussed below. These benefits may include cash grants\nfrom the Israeli government and tax benefits, based upon, among other things, the location within Israel of the facility in which the investment and manufacture\nactivity are made. In order to qualify for these incentives, an Approved Enterprise, a Beneficiary Enterprise or, a Preferred Enterprise, a Special Preferred\nEnterprise, a Preferred Technology Enterprise or Special Preferred Technology Enterprise, is required to comply with the requirements of the Investment Law.\n62\nThe Investment Law has been amended several times over the recent years, with the three most significant changes effective as of April 1, 2005, to which we\nrefer as the 2005 Amendment, as of January 1, 2011, to which we refer as the 2011 Amendment, and as of January 1, 2017, to which we refer as the 2017\nAmendment. Pursuant to the 2005 Amendment, tax benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to its revision by the 2005\nAmendment, remain in force, but any benefits granted subsequently are subject to the provisions of the amended Investment Law. Similarly, the 2011 Amendment\nintroduced new benefits instead of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to the 2011 Amendment, yet companies\nentitled to benefits under the Investment Law as in effect up to January 1, 2011, were entitled to choose to continue to enjoy such benefits, provided that certain\nconditions are met, or elect instead, irrevocably, to forego such benefits and elect for the benefits of the 2011 Amendment. The 2017 Amendment introduces new\nbenefits for Technological Enterprises, alongside the existing tax benefits.\nThe following discussion is a summary of the Investment Law prior to its amendments as well as the relevant changes contained in the new legislation.\nTax benefits for Approved Enterprises approved before April 1, 2005.\nUnder the Investment Law prior to the 2005 Amendment, a company that wished to receive benefits on its investment program that is implemented in\naccordance with the provisions of the Investment Law, to which we refer as an “Approved Enterprise”, had to receive an approval from the Israeli Authority for\nInvestments and Development of the Industry and Economy, to which we refer as the Investment Center. Each certificate of approval for an Approved Enterprise\nrelates to a specific investment program in the Approved Enterprise, delineated both by the financial scope of the investment, including sources of funds, and by\nthe physical characteristics of the facility or other assets.\nAn Approved Enterprise may elect to forego any entitlement to the cash grants otherwise available under the Investment Law and, instead, participate in an\nalternative benefits program. We have chosen to receive the benefits through the alternative benefits program. Under the alternative benefits program, a company’s\nundistributed income derived from an Approved Enterprise will be exempt from corporate tax for a period of between two and ten years from the first year of\ntaxable income, depending on the geographic location within Israel of the Approved Enterprise, and a reduced corporate tax rate of between 10% to 25% for the\nremainder of the benefits period, depending on the level of foreign investment in the company in each year, as detailed below. The benefits commence on the date\nin which that taxable income is first earned. The benefits period under Approved Enterprise status is limited to 12 years from the year in which the production\ncommenced (as determined by the Investment Center), or 14 years from the year of receipt of the approval as an Approved Enterprise, whichever ends earlier. If a\ncompany has more than one Approved Enterprise program or if only a portion of its capital investments are approved, its effective tax rate is the result of a\nweighted combination of the applicable rates. The tax benefits available under any certificate of approval relate only to taxable income attributable to the specific\nprogram and are contingent upon meeting the criteria set out in the certificate of approval. Income derived from activity that is not integral to the activity of the\nApproved Enterprise will not enjoy tax benefits. Our entitlement to the above benefits is subject to fulfillment of certain conditions, according to the law and\nrelated regulations.\n63\nA company that has an Approved Enterprise program is eligible for further tax benefits if it qualifies as a Foreign Investors’ Company, to which we refer as an\nFIC. An FIC eligible for benefits is essentially a company with a level of foreign investment, as defined in the Investment Law, of more than 25%. The level of\nforeign investment is measured as the percentage of rights in the company (in terms of shares, rights to profits, voting and appointment of directors), and of\ncombined share and loan capital, that are owned, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not residents of Israel. The determination as to whether or not a\ncompany qualifies as a FIC is made on an annual basis according to the lowest level of foreign investment during the year. An FIC that has an Approved Enterprise\nprogram will be eligible for an extension of the period during which it is entitled to tax benefits under its Approved Enterprise status (so that the benefits period\nmay be up to ten years) and for further tax benefits if the level of foreign investment exceeds 49%. If a company that has an Approved Enterprise program is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of another company, then the percentage of foreign investments is determined based on the percentage of foreign investment in the parent\ncompany.\nThe corporate tax rates and related levels of foreign investments with respect to an FIC that has an Approved Enterprise program are set forth in the following\ntable:\nPercentage of non-Israeli ownership Corporate Tax Rate\nOver 25% but less than 49% up to 25%\n49% or more but less than 74% 20 %\n74% or more but less than 90% 15 %\n90% or more 10 %\nA company that has elected to participate in the alternative benefits program and that subsequently pays a dividend (or deemed dividend, as described below)\nout of the income derived from the portion of its facilities that have been granted Approved Enterprise status during the tax exemption period will be subject to tax\nin respect of the amount of dividend distributed (grossed up to reflect such pre-tax income that it would have had to earn in order to distribute the dividend) at the\ncorporate tax rate that would have been otherwise applicable if such income had not been tax-exempted under the alternative benefits program. This rate generally\nranges from 10% to 25%, depending on the level of foreign investment in the company in each year, as explained above.\nIn addition, dividends paid out of income attributed to an Approved Enterprise (or out of dividends received from a company whose income is attributed to an\nApproved Enterprise) are generally subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15%, or at a lower rate provided under an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in\nadvance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate). The 15% tax rate is limited to dividends and distributions out of\nincome derived during the benefits period and actually paid at any time up to 12 years thereafter. After this period, the withholding tax is applied at a rate of up to\n30%, or at the lower rate under an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced\ntax rate). In the case of an FIC, the 12-year limitation on reduced withholding tax on dividends does not apply.\nThe Investment Law also provides that an Approved Enterprise is entitled to accelerated depreciation on its property and equipment that are included in an\napproved investment program in the first five years of using the equipment. This benefit is an incentive granted by the Israeli government regardless of whether the\nalternative benefits program is elected.\nThe benefits available to an Approved Enterprise are subject to the continued fulfillment of conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations and\nthe criteria in the specific certificate of approval, as described above. If a company does not meet these conditions, it would be required to refund the amount of tax\nbenefits, adjusted to the Israeli consumer price index and interest, or other monetary penalty.\n64\nWe have received the requisite approval, including a final approval, for our Approved Enterprise investment programs, in accordance with the Investment Law.\nThe above-described benefits that accompany these investment programs and our Beneficiary Enterprise investment programs (for which accompanying benefits\nare described below) have had the effect, historically, up to 2020 of reducing our (and before the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger, Objet’s) effective consolidated\ntax rates considerably lower than the statutory Israeli corporate tax rate, which for 2018 and onwards has been set at 23%.\nTax benefits under the 2005 Amendment that became effective on April 1, 2005.\nThe 2005 Amendment applies to new investment programs and investment programs commencing after 2004, and does not apply to investment programs\napproved prior to April 1, 2005. The 2005 Amendment provides that terms and benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted before the 2005\nAmendment became effective (April 1, 2005) will remain subject to the provisions of the Investment Law as in effect on the date of such approval. Pursuant to the\n2005 Amendment, the Investment Center will continue to grant Approved Enterprise status to qualifying investments. However, the 2005 Amendment limits the\nscope of enterprises that may be approved by the Investment Center by setting criteria for the approval of a facility as an Approved Enterprise.\nAn enterprise that qualifies under the new provisions is referred to as a “Beneficiary Enterprise”, rather than “Approved Enterprise”. The 2005 Amendment\nprovides that the approval of the Investment Center is required only for Approved Enterprises that receive cash grants. As a result, a company is no longer required\nto obtain the advance approval of the Investment Center in order to receive the tax benefits previously available under the alternative benefits program. Rather, a\ncompany may claim the tax benefits offered by the Investment Law directly in its tax returns, provided that its facilities meet the criteria for tax benefits set forth in\nthe 2005 Amendment. A company that has a Beneficiary Enterprise may, at its discretion, approach the Israel Tax Authority for a pre-ruling confirming that it is in\ncompliance with the provisions of the Investment Law.\nTax benefits are available under the 2005 Amendment to production facilities (or other eligible facilities) which are generally required to derive 25% or more of\ntheir business income from export to specific markets with a population of at least 14 million in 2012 (such export criteria will further be increased in the future by\n1.4% per annum). In order to receive the tax benefits, the 2005 Amendment states that a company must make an investment which meets certain conditions set\nforth in the amendment for tax benefits and which exceeds a minimum amount specified in the Investment Law. Such investment entitles a company to receive a\nBeneficiary Enterprise status with respect to the investment and may be made over a period of no more than three years ending in the year in which the company\nchose to have the tax benefits apply to the Beneficiary Enterprise. The benefits period under the Beneficiary Enterprise status is limited to 12 years from the year\nthe company chose to have its tax benefits apply.\nWhere a company requests to have the tax benefits apply to an expansion of existing facilities, only the expansion will be considered to be a Beneficiary\nEnterprise and the company’s effective tax rate will be the weighted average of the applicable rates. In such case, the minimum investment required in order to\nqualify as a Beneficiary Enterprise must exceed a certain percentage of the value of the company’s production assets before the expansion.\nThe extent of the tax benefits available under the 2005 Amendment to qualifying income of a Beneficiary Enterprise depends on, among other things, the\ngeographic location within Israel of the Beneficiary Enterprise. Such tax benefits include an exemption from corporate tax on undistributed income for a period of\nbetween two to ten years, depending on the geographic location of the Beneficiary Enterprise within Israel, and a reduced corporate tax rate of between 10% to\n25% for the remainder of the benefits period, depending on the level of foreign investment in the company in each year, as explained above.\n65\nDividends paid out of income attributed to a Beneficiary Enterprise will be treated similarly to payment of dividends by an Approved Enterprise under the\nalternative benefits program. Therefore, dividends paid out of income attributed to a Beneficiary Enterprise (or out of dividends received from a company whose\nincome is attributed to a Beneficiary Enterprise) are generally subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (increased to 20% on the profits accumulated from\nJanuary 1, 2014) or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax\nAuthority allowing for a reduced tax rate). The reduced rate of 15% or 20% are limited to dividends and distributions out of income attributed to a Beneficiary\nEnterprise during the benefits period and actually paid at any time up to 12 years thereafter except with respect to an FIC, in which case the 12-year limit does not\napply.\nFurthermore, a company qualifying for tax benefits under the 2005 Amendment, which pays a dividend (or deemed dividend, as described below)out of income\nattributed to its Beneficiary Enterprise during the tax exemption period, will be subject to tax in respect of the amount of the dividend distributed (grossed-up to\nreflect the pre-tax income that it would have had to earn in order to distribute the dividend) at the corporate tax rate which would have otherwise been Israel Tax\nAuthority allowing for a reduced tax rate). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld. If such dividends are\ndistributed to a foreign company and other conditions are met, the withholding tax rate will be applicable.\nThe benefits available to a Beneficiary Enterprise are subject to the continued fulfillment of conditions stipulated in the Investment Law and its regulations. If a\ncompany does not meet these conditions, it would be required to refund the amount of tax benefits, as adjusted by the Israeli consumer price index and interest, or\nother monetary penalty.\nIn 2021, the Company gave notice to the Israeli tax authorities that it waived the Approved / Beneficiary Enterprise regime starting from tax year 2021.\nTax incentives programs which may be relevant for the company starting from financial year 2021\nTax benefits under the 2011 Amendment that became effective on January 1, 2011.\nThe 2011 Amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to 2011 and, instead,\nintroduced new benefits for income generated by a “Preferred Company” through its Preferred Enterprise (as such terms are defined in the Investment Law) as of\nJanuary 1, 2011. A Preferred Company is defined as either (i) a company incorporated in Israel which is not wholly owned by a governmental entity, or (ii) a\nlimited partnership that: (a) was registered under the Israeli Partnerships Ordinance and; (b) all of its limited partners are companies incorporated in Israel, but not\nall of them are governmental entities; which has, among other things, Preferred Enterprise status and is controlled and managed from Israel. Pursuant to the 2011\nAmendment, a Preferred Company was entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 15% with respect to its preferred income attributed to its Preferred Enterprise in\n2011 and 2012, unless the Preferred Enterprise was located in a certain development zone, in which case the rate was 10%. Such corporate tax rate was reduced to\n12.5% and 7%, respectively, in 2013 and was increased to 16% and 9%, respectively, in 2014 until 2016. Pursuant to the 2017 Amendment, in 2017 and thereafter,\nthe corporate tax rate for Preferred Enterprise which is located in a certain development zone was decreased to 7.5%, while the reduced corporate tax rate for other\ndevelopment zones remains 16%. Income derived by a Preferred Company from a ‘Special Preferred Enterprise’ (as such term is defined in the Investment Law)\nwould be entitled, during a benefits period of 10 years, to further reduced tax rates of 8%, or to 5% if the Special Preferred Enterprise is located in a certain\ndevelopment zone. Since January 1, 2017, the definition for “Special Preferred Enterprise” includes less stringent conditions.\n66\nDividends paid out of preferred income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise or to a Special Preferred Enterprise are generally subject to withholding tax at source\nat the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax\nAuthority allowing for a reduced tax rate). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld (although, if such dividends\nare subsequently distributed to individuals or a non-Israeli company, withholding tax at a rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax\ntreaty will apply). In 2018-2020, dividends paid out of preferred income attributed to a Special Preferred Enterprise, directly to a foreign parent company, were\nsubject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 5% (temporary provisions).\nThe 2011 Amendment also provided transitional provisions to address companies already enjoying current benefits under the Investment Law. These transitional\nprovisions provide, among other things, that unless an irrevocable request is made to apply the provisions of the Investment Law as amended in 2011 with respect\nto income to be derived as of January 1, 2011: (i) the terms and benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted to an Approved Enterprise, which\nchose to receive grants, before the 2011 Amendment became effective, will remain subject to the provisions of the Investment Law as in effect on the date of such\napproval, and subject to certain conditions;. (ii) the terms and benefits included in any certificate of approval that was granted to an Approved Enterprise, that had\nparticipated in an alternative benefits program, before the 2011 Amendment became effective will remain subject to the provisions of the Investment Law as in\neffect on the date of such approval, provided that certain conditions are met; and (iii) a Beneficiary Enterprise can elect to continue to benefit from the benefits\nprovided to it before the 2011 Amendment came into effect, provided that certain conditions are met.\nWe have examined the possible effect, if any, of these provisions of the 2011 Amendment on our financial statements and have decided, at this time, not to opt\nto apply the new benefits under the 2011 Amendment.\nTax benefits under the 2017 Amendment that became effective on January 1, 2017.\nThe 2017 Amendment was enacted as part of the Economic Efficiency Law that was published on December 29, 2016, and was effective as of January 1, 2017.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides new tax benefits for two types of “Technology Enterprises”, as described below, and is in addition to the other existing tax\nbeneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions will qualify as a “Preferred Technology Enterprise” and will thereby\nenjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on income that qualifies as “Preferred Technology Income,” as defined in the Investment Law. The tax rate is further\nreduced to 7.5% for a Preferred Technology Enterprise located in development zone A. In addition, a Preferred Technology Company will enjoy a reduced\ncorporate tax rate of 12% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain “Benefitted Intangible Assets” (as defined in the Investment Law) to a related foreign\ncompany if the Benefitted Intangible Assets were acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017 for at least NIS 200 million, and the sale receives\nprior approval from the IIA.\nThe 2017 Amendment further provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions will qualify as a “Special Preferred Technology Enterprise” and\nwill thereby enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on “Preferred Technology Income” regardless of the company’s geographic location within Israel. In\naddition, a Special Preferred Technology Enterprise will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain “Benefitted\nIntangible Assets” to a related foreign company if the Benefitted Intangible Assets were either developed by the Special Preferred Technology Enterprise or\nacquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017, and the sale received prior approval from the IIA. A Special Preferred Technology Enterprise that\nacquires Benefitted Intangible Assets from a foreign company for more than NIS 500 million will be eligible for these benefits for at least ten years, subject to\ncertain approvals as specified in the Investment Law.\n67\nDividends distributed by a Preferred Technology Enterprise or a Special Preferred Technology Enterprise, paid out of Preferred Technology Income, are\ngenerally subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance\nof a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to\nbe withheld. If such dividends are distributed to a foreign company and other conditions are met, the withholding tax rate will be 4%.\nIn 2021, the Company provided notice to the Israeli tax authorities that it waived the Approved / Beneficiary Enterprise regime starting from tax year 2021. The\nCompany is currently considering its qualification for the 2017 amendment and the term and degree to which it may be qualified as a Preferred Technology\nEnterprise or Special Preferred Technology Enterprise.\nTax benefits under 2021 Amendments\nOn November 15, 2021, the Investment Law was amended to reduce the ability of companies to retain the tax-exempt profits. Effective August 15, 2021,\ndividend distributions (or deemed distribution, as described below), will be treated as if made on a pro-rata basis from all types of earnings, including Exempt\nProfits (as defined below).\nIn parallel to the above amendment, the Investment Law was amended to provide, on a temporary basis, a reduced corporate income tax on the distribution or\nrelease within a year from such amendment of tax-exempt profits derived by Approved and Benefited Enterprises, which we refer to as Exempt Profits (the\n“Temporary Provision”). The amount of the reduced tax will be determined based on a formula. In order to qualify for the reduction, the Company must invest\ncertain amounts in productive assets and research and development in Israel.\nFollowing recent Israeli district court ruling (which is subject to deliberation of the Supreme Court), certain transactions (such as acquisitions and intercompany\nloans) may be treated as deemed dividend distributions for the purpose of the Encouragement Law triggering corporate tax on the respective amount of the\ntransaction.\nOn November 13, 2022, according to the Temporary Provision, the Company released an amount of approximately $44.8 million out of its Exempt Profits and\naccordingly paid reduced tax of approximately $2.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had accumulated tax-exempt income of approximately $157.6 million that is attributable to our various Approved and Beneficiary\nEnterprise programs. If such tax-exempt income were to be distributed, it would be taxed at the reduced corporate tax rate applicable to such income, which would\nhave amounted to approximately $15.8 million of tax liability as of December 31, 2023.\nPillar Two Taxation\nThe OECD introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Pillar Two rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15% for large multinational\ncorporations. On December 12, 2022, the EU Council announced that EU member states had reached an agreement to implement the minimum taxation component\nof 15% of the OECD’s reform of international taxation. Other countries have also enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as January 1,\n2024, with general implementation of a global minimum tax by January 1, 2025. The OECD continues to release additional guidance and the Company is\nmonitoring the new rules and country agreements. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements and related\ndisclosures and does not expect Pillar Two to have a material impact on its effective tax rate or consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future.\n68\nC. Organizational Structure.\nOur corporate structure includes Stratasys Ltd., our Israeli parent company, and the following main active wholly-owned subsidiary entities:\n• Stratasys, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was formerly a publicly held company and which became our indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary as a result\nof the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger. Following our acquisition of Origin in December 2020, Stratasys, Inc. now has offices and warehouses in San\nFrancisco, California;\n• Stratasys Direct, Inc. (our parts service business unit), a California corporation;\n• Stratasys AP Limited, a Hong Kong limited company, which together with several other subsidiaries (including Stratasys Japan Co. Ltd., our Japanese\nsubsidiary, and Stratasys Shanghai Ltd., our Chinese subsidiary), carries out most of our operations in the Asia Pacific region;\n• Stratasys GMBH, a German limited liability company, which together with other subsidiaries (including Stratasys Schweiz AG (Stratasys Switzerland\nLtd.), our Swiss subsidiary) carries out our European operations; and\n• Stratasys Latin America Representacao De Equipamentos Ltd., a Brazilian subsidiary, which has commenced our Brazilian operations.\nWe also own a 46.5% interest in Ultimaker, which includes the operations of our former subsidiary, MakerBot, and which offers a comprehensive solution set of\nhardware, software and materials for Desktop 3D printing.\nPlease see the list of subsidiaries appended to this annual report as Exhibit 8 for a complete list of our subsidiaries as of the date of this annual report.\nD. Property, Plants and Equipment.\nWe have dual headquarters, in Eden Prairie, Minnesota and Rehovot, Israel.\nOur Eden Prairie, Minnesota headquarters (near Minneapolis) is comprised of executive offices and production facilities that encompassed, as of December 31,\n2023, approximately 308,646 square feet, of which we owned 227,100 square feet, in three buildings. Those buildings served the following purposes: system\nassembly, inventory storage, operations and sales support; manufacturing for one of our Stratasys Direct Manufacturing paid parts service locations; research and\ndevelopment, filament manufacturing, administrative, marketing and sales activities; and expansion of our production capacity for systems and consumables.\nDuring 2022, we entered into a new lease of an additional 168,100 square feet for storage purposes, which increases our shipping efficiency and eliminates the cost\nincrease for managing our inventory through third parties.\nOur new building complex in Rehovot, Israel, which contains two buildings, is situated on a property that we purchased in 2015 and encompasses\napproximately 284,713 square feet. It houses our Israeli headquarters, research and development facilities and certain marketing activities. We entered the first\nbuilding in January 2017 and the second building in May 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we lease office space (except with respect to our Eden Prairie headquarters facilities and our Rehovot, Israel and Kiryat Gat, Israel\nfacilities, where we own the property) for various purposes, as set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise stated, all of our facilities are fully utilized. Our\nmaterial tangible fixed assets include, among other things, the properties listed below.\nLocation: Primary Usage: Area (Sq.

SFO was relocated to our Israeli\nheadquarters during the first quarter of 2023.\n2 In 2023 as part of our acquisition of Covestro Additive Manufacturing, we acquired three new sites-Elgin, Illinois, with 27,384 square feet, Geleen in the\nNetherlands, with 6,941 square feet, and Shanghai China, with 2,799 square feet.\n3 This square footage includes the area of the two buildings of our new Israel headquarters in Rehovot, Israel. The second of those buildings was inhabited by us in\nMay 2021, of which 92,400 square feet was leased by us to a third party under a long-term lease and another 9,938 of square feet was leased by us to another third\nparty for a short term lease that will expire in April 2024.\n69\nITEM 4A. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone.\n70\nITEM 5. OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report. The\ndiscussion below contains forward-looking statements that are based upon our current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to\ninaccurate assumptions and known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including those identified in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in Item 3.D “Key Information – Risk Factors”, above.\nA. Operating Results.\nOverview of Business and Trend Information\nWe are a global leader in connected, polymer-based 3D printing solutions, across the entire manufacturing value chain. Leveraging distinct competitive\nadvantages that include a broad set of best-in-class 3D printing platforms, software, a materials and technology partner ecosystem, innovative leadership, and\nglobal GTM infrastructure, we are positioned to capture share in a significant and growing global marketplace, with a focus on manufacturing, which we view as\nhaving the largest and fastest growing total addressable market.\nOur approximately 2,600 granted and pending additive technology patents to date have been used to create models, prototypes, manufacturing tools, and\nproduction parts for a multitude of industries including aerospace, automotive, transportation, healthcare, consumer products, dental, medical, fashion and\neducation. Our products and comprehensive solutions improve product quality, development time, cost, time-to-market and patient care. Our 3D ecosystem of\nsolutions and expertise includes 3D printers, materials, software, expert services, and on-demand parts production. By the end of 2023, we estimate that we derived\nover 34.0% of our revenues from manufacturing solutions.\nA series of recent acquisitions and other transactions has strengthened our leadership in various facets of our business, and has added incremental growth\nengines to our platform. Our acquisition, in December 2020, of Origin Laboratories, Inc., or Origin, significantly strengthened our leadership in mass production\nfor polymer 3D printing. Origin’s pioneering approach to additive manufacturing of end-use parts has enabled us to serve a large market with manufacturing-grade\n3D printers, utilizing P3 Programmable PhotoPolymerization. Our acquisition, in the first quarter of 2021, of UK-based RP Support Ltd., or RPS, a provider of\nindustrial stereolithography 3D printers and solutions, provided us with a complementary technology that further expanded our polymer suite of solutions across\nthe product life cycle. Similarly, our acquisition, in November 2021, of all remaining shares of Xaar 3D Ltd. or Xaar, has begun to accelerate our growth in\nproduction-scale 3D printing. The recently completed transaction between our former subsidiary, MakerBot, a leader in desktop 3D printing, and Ultimaker, gave\nus an approximately 46.5% stake in a new entity that has a broad technology offering, a larger scale, and that is well-capitalized and is therefore better equipped to\ncompete in the desktop 3D printing segment. Our October 2022 asset acquisition from the quality assurance software company Riven, a Berkeley, California-based\nstart-up, enables us to fully integrate its cloud-based software solution into our GrabCAD® Additive Manufacturing Platform, thereby enabling more\nmanufacturing customers to adopt Stratasys solutions for end-use parts production. Our acquisition, in April 2023, of Covestro’s additive manufacturing business\ngives us the ability to accelerate innovative developments in 3D printing materials and to thereby further grow adoption of our newest technologies, including our\nOrigin P3™, Neo® stereolithography, and H350™ printers, with which Covestro’s resins can be used. Also, as part of this acquisition we acquired an IP portfolio\ncomprised of hundreds of patents and pending patents.\nRecent Developments- Potential Business Combinations and Strategic Alternatives\nThroughout 2023, we were involved in, and were the subject of, potential business combination transactions that would have been potentially transformative to the\nadditive manufacturing industry. Towards the end of the fiscal year, after none of such transactions had been completed (for various reasons), we initiated a whole-\nscale, comprehensive analysis of our strategic options, which we have been conducting together with our advisors since the fourth quarter of 2023, carrying over\ninto the first quarter of 2024. We provide a brief overview of recent developments concerning strategic transactions and processes below.\n71\nTermination of Merger Agreement with Desktop Metal\nOn May 25, 2023, we and Desktop Metal, Inc. (“Desktop Metal”), jointly announced our entry into a merger agreement, whereby our wholly-owned Delaware\nsubsidiary was to merge with and into Desktop Metal, with Desktop Metal surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. On September 28, 2023, we\nheld an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, at which the merger was presented for the approval of our shareholders. The merger proposal was not\napproved by our shareholders at that meeting, and accordingly, pursuant to our rights under the merger agreement, we terminated the merger agreement with\nDesktop Metal, effective immediately on September 28, 2023. As a result, we were required to pay, and recorded in our financial statements, a termination fee of\n$10.0 million, which was included under selling, general & administrative expenses.\nNano Dimension Uncompleted Tender Offer and Unsuccessful Board Contest\nOn May 25, 2023, following the announcement of our then-prospective merger with Desktop Metal, Nano Dimension Ltd, (“Nano”), a 14.1% shareholder of\nour company, launched a hostile partial tender offer whereby it sought to acquire—including shares already held by it— between 53% and 55% of our outstanding\nordinary shares, at a price of $18.00 per share. The tender offer was subject to various conditions and was originally set to expire on June 26, 2023. Over the course\nof subsequent periods of time, the price offered by Nano in its tender offer was ultimately raised to $25.00 per share, with an accompanying reduction as to the\npercentage of our shares to be held by it upon consummation of the offer, to between 46% and 51%, and the offer was extended ultimately through July 31, 2023.\nThe offer expired on July 31, 2023 and Nano did not receive enough tendered shares and was therefore unable to complete the purchase of any of our ordinary\nshares pursuant to the offer.\nNano also requested from our company, pursuant to its rights under the Israeli Companies Law as a 5% or greater shareholder, that we convene an extraordinary\nshareholder meeting at which a vote would be held on the removal of all of our directors (except for S, Scott Crump) and their replacement with officers of Nano\nwhom it had nominated. After discussions with Nano and related court proceedings, we ultimately brought to a vote at our annual general meeting of shareholders\nheld on August 8, 2023 a contested election of directors, at which our board’s eight nominees and Nano’s seven nominees were subject to election on a nominee-\nby-nominee basis, with the eight nominees receiving more “FOR” votes than “AGAINST” votes to be deemed elected. Based on that agreed voting format, at the\nannual meeting, each of our board’s eight nominees, and none of Nano’s seven nominees, were elected. We have also been subject to litigation with Nano in an\nIsraeli district court regarding our shareholder rights plan, Nano’s uncompleted tender offer, and the above-described contested board election. The litigation has\nnot changed the outcome of any of the developments described above.\n3D Systems Offers\nOn May 30, 2023, and then again on June 27, 2023, we received an unsolicited non-binding indicative proposal from 3D Systems Corporation (“3D Systems”)\nto merge with us. On July 13, 2023, we received an updated proposal from 3D Systems, pursuant to which it would merge with our company for $7.50 in cash and\n1.5444 newly issued shares of common stock of 3D Systems per Stratasys ordinary share. Our board initially determined that the 3D Systems proposal of July 13\nwould reasonably be expected to result in a “Superior Proposal” under the merger agreement with Desktop Metal and authorized our management to enter into\ndiscussions with 3D Systems with respect to the proposal. Following an extensive due diligence process, however, we communicated our concerns regarding the\n3D Systems’ proposal to 3D Systems and indicated that the last proposal was not itself a transaction that we would be prepared to enter into. 3D Systems revised its\nproposal on September 6, 2023, offering $7.00 in cash and 1.6387 newly issued shares of common stock of 3D Systems per Stratasys ordinary share. After\nconsultation with our outside financial and legal advisors, our board of directors unanimously determined that the September 6 proposal continued to significantly\nundervalue our company and did not constitute a “Superior Proposal” pursuant to the terms of our then effective merger agreement with Desktop Metal, and the\nboard accordingly terminated discussions with 3D Systems.\nInitiation of Strategic Alternatives Process\n72\nOn September 28, 2023, following the failure of the vote for approval of the merger with Desktop Metal and our consequent termination of the related merger\nagreement, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive process to explore strategic alternatives for our company. We noted that we are no longer subject\nto restrictions under that merger agreement regarding the solicitation of or entry into potential transactions.\nBusiness Performance in Macro-Economic Environment\nOur current outlook, as well as our results of operations in the year ended December 31, 2023, should be evaluated in light of current global macroeconomic\nconditions, including certain challenging trends that have also impacted the additive manufacturing industry. Our revenues in 2023 decreased by 3.7% on a year-\nover-year basis, compared to 2022. The decrease is driven by the divestment of Makerbot in 2022 and from the divestment of certain SDM businesses. These\nrevenue results also evidence macroeconomic pressure on capital expenditure budgets of our customers, which has been causing longer sales cycles for our\nsystems and occasional deferral of orders of our systems. On the other hand, these results also evidence stronger utilization of our installed systems by our\ncustomers, which drove higher revenues in consumables, as well as increase in consumables revenue based on sales of consumables to customers of our recently\nacquired entities.\nWe continue to closely monitor macroeconomic conditions, including the headwinds caused by inflation, increased interest rates and other trends that have been\nadversely impacting economic activity on a global scale, and which have also adversely affected the additive manufacturing industry generally and our company,\nin particular. We have been assessing, on an ongoing basis, the implications of those global conditions for our operations, supply chain, liquidity, cash flow and\ncustomer orders, and have been acting in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences as needed. We estimate that those conditions have impacted us most notably\nby limiting our ability to increase our gross margins and our operating margins more significantly in the short-term, given the increased cost of goods and\noperating expenses associated with inflation. We have used price increases to offset those cost pressures. Assuming that those inflationary pressures ease, and the\nglobal economy remains relatively stable, we expect that those margins will improve, as we execute on our growth plans and as a result of a favorable products\nmix.\nSpecific developments that may potentially impact our operating performance in an adverse manner include:\n• Israel’s retaliatory war against the terrorist organization, which up to the present time has had a limited impact on our Israeli and global operations.\nHowever, given the fact that one of our global headquarters and one of our manufacturing facilities are located in Israel, in case the war widens into a\nregional conflict and/or worsens Israeli or global economic conditions, that could have an adverse impact on our operations;\n• reluctance of central banks in Europe and the U.S. to reduce interest rates, due to a fear that it would trigger upwards inflationary pressure, which would\nleave interest rates at their current relatively high levels, thereby leaving in place unfavorable credit/financing conditions for our customers who purchase\nour products; and\n• potential contraction of economic activities and recessionary conditions that could arise as a result of persistently high interest rates, which could\neventually cause a decrease in consumer demand.\nWe ended 2023 with $162.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term deposits. We believe that we are well suited to continue to manage the current\nglobal macro- economic climate with a strong balance sheet and no debt, while focusing on cost controls and cash generation. We have continued to selectively\napply certain cost controls, which we began doing at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, while ensuring that our NPI programs are well-funded, and we plan to\ncontinue investing as needed in order to support our new product development programs.\nKey measures of our performance\nRevenues\n73\nOur revenues results primarily from sales of (i) our products, which include both our AM systems and related consumable materials, (ii) provision of related\nservices and (iii) our direct manufacturing service. We generate revenues and deliver services principally through the following channels:\n• sales to resellers, who purchase and resell our products and who provide support services for our printing systems;\n• sales of systems that are marketed by independent sales agents, pursuant to which we sell directly to end-users, pay commissions to such agents, and\ndirectly handle the sale of consumables and provision of support services; and\n• sales of systems (and all related products and services) as well as our direct manufacturing solutions that we provide to our customers directly.\nProduct revenues\nProduct revenues are influenced by a number of factors, including, among other things, (i) the adoption rate for our products, (ii) end-user product design\napplication and manufacturing activity, and (iii) the capital expenditure budgets of end-users and potential end-users, all of which may be significantly influenced\nby macroeconomic factors. Product revenues are also impacted by the mix of 3D printers that we sell. Purchases of our 3D printing and production systems,\nespecially our higher-end, higher-priced systems, typically involve longer sales cycles.\nProduct revenues also depend upon the volume of consumables that we sell. Sales of our consumable materials are linked to the number of AM systems that are\ninstalled and active worldwide. Sales of consumables are also driven by system usage, which is generally a function of the size of the particular system and the\nlevel of design and manufacturing activity and budget of the particular end-user. Larger systems generally use greater amounts of consumables due to their greater\ncapacity and the higher levels of design and production.\nServices revenues\nServices revenues derive from (i) maintenance contracts and initial systems warranty; (ii) direct manufacturing paid-parts services; and (iii) other professional\nservice contracts. In addition, in connection with direct sales, we generally charge separately for installation and training. Additional services revenues are\ngenerated from services contracts most often entered into directly with end-users subsequent to the expiration of the initial warranty period.\nCosts of revenues\nOur costs of revenues consist of costs of products and costs of services. Costs of products consist primarily of components and subassemblies purchased for the\nmanufacture of our AM systems and raw materials, such as thermoplastic and photopolymer materials, for the manufacture of our consumables, as well as any\nroyalties paid with respect to sales of certain of those consumables. Costs of products also include manufacturing and manufacturing-related labor costs, indirect\nproduction costs and depreciation, as well as amortization expense which is mainly related to developed technology assets acquired as part of our business\ncombinations.\nOur costs of services revenues consist primarily of costs of our service personnel, material and other production costs of our direct manufacturing service\nbusiness, and installation costs, which include engineers dedicated to on-site training and support, and travel costs of these engineers. Both costs of products and\ncosts of services include related facilities costs.\n74\nOur most significant components of costs of revenues are costs of materials used for our products, wages and related benefits costs, which together accounted\nfor approximately 64% of our total direct cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. An additional significant component of our costs of revenues is\nthe amortization expense that we primarily incur in connection with developed technology assets acquired as part of our business combinations. These amortization\nexpenses vary based on the timing and type of acquisitions and estimated useful lives of the respective intangible assets. These amortization expenses were $19.6\nmillion, $28.2 million and $22.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No impairment charges were recorded during 2023\nand 2022. Refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, a hypothetical 10% rise in commodity prices for raw materials would have caused an approximate $15.4 million\nincrease in costs of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss. As to wages and related benefits, a 10% increase in wages due\nto wage inflation would have caused an approximate $6.8 million increase in costs of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive\nloss. During 2023, we did not notice particular trends that changed, or were expected to change in the near future, the absolute or relative significance of the\ncomponents of our costs of revenues in a material manner. We also believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial\ncondition during the three most recent fiscal years, as we have used price increases to offset the cost pressures caused by inflation.\nCurrently, we do not foresee a significant change in either the raw materials used for production or wage inflation that would materially impact our business.\nFor further information, please see “Item 11. Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in this annual report.\nGross profit\nThe gross profit and gross margin for our products are influenced by a number of factors. The most important of these is the mix of our products sold.\nSpecifically, the gross margins on our higher-end AM systems, as well as on our consumables, are typically higher than the gross margins on our entry-level\nproducts and MakerBot desktop printers. Accordingly, an increase in the share of revenues of our entry-level products out of total revenues could cause our profit\nmargins to decrease. Furthermore, we believe that as our worldwide installed base of AM systems increases, subsequent sales of our proprietary consumables will\nalso increase. We also seek to reduce our costs of revenues by improving our ability to use less costly components, better management of our inventories levels and\nincreasing manufacturing efficiencies in the production of our systems. In addition, we will also seek to achieve lower material costs and leverage our overall\ncapabilities in our direct manufacturing service business.\nProducts gross margins are also impacted by the mix of revenues generated from sales to resellers based in different geographical areas as opposed to sales that\nare facilitated by independent sales agents or directly by us.\nService gross margins are influenced mainly by the volume of revenues generated from our direct manufacturing service business as well as the ratio of service\nengineers to our installed base in a given geographic area.\nOperating expenses\nOur operating expenses for 2023 consisted of (i) research and development expenses, and (ii) selling, general and administrative expenses.\n75\nResearch and development expenses, net\nOur research and development activities consist of projects aimed at developing new printing systems and materials and projects aimed at enhancing the\ncapabilities of our existing product lines, as well as significant technology platform and applications, developments for our current technologies, including our\nintegrated software. We also seek to develop disruptive technologies and other process improvement solutions in the additive manufacturing ecosystem. Our\nresearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and employee-related personnel expenses, materials, laboratory supplies, costs for\nrelated software and costs for facilities. Expenditures for research, development and engineering of products are expensed as incurred. Our research and\ndevelopment efforts are essential to our future growth and our ability to remain competitive in the AM market. We work closely with existing and potential\ncustomers, distribution channels and major resellers, who provide significant feedback for product development and innovation.\nWe are also entitled to reimbursements from certain government funding plans. These reimbursements are recognized as a reduction of expenses as the related\ncost is incurred. We are not required to pay royalties on sales of products developed using our government funding.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses include employee compensation and employee-related expenses for marketing, sales and other sales-operation\npositions, and for managerial and administrative functions, including executive officers, accounting, legal, information technology and human resources. This\ncategory of expenses also covers commissions, advertising and promotions expenses, professional service fees, respective depreciation, amortization expenses\nrelated to certain intangible assets, as well as associated overhead.\nCommissions consist of sales-based commissions to independent sales agents and internal sales personnel. Commission rates vary, depending on the geographic\nlocation of the agent, type of products sold, and the degree of achievement of certain performance targets. Our advertising and promotion expenses consist\nprimarily of media advertising costs, trade and consumer marketing expenses and public relations expenses which aim to strengthen the leadership of our brand in\nkey vertical markets.\nFacilities costs that are included in our selling, general and administrative expenses include an allocated portion of the occupancy costs for our facilities in\ncountries where sales, marketing and administrative personnel are located. Professional service fees for accounting and legal services are also included in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses.\n2023 Financial Highlights\nSignificant highlights of our financial performance in 2023 included:\n• Revenues decreased by $23.9 million, or 3.7%, compared to 2022. The decrease is driven by the divestment of Makerbot in 2022 and from the divestment\nof certain SDM businesses. These revenue results also evidence macro-economic pressure on capital expenditure budgets of our customers, which has been\ncausing longer sales cycles for our systems and occasional deferral of orders of our systems.\n• Operating expenses increased by $21.0 million, or 6.3% compared to 2022. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by costs related to\nprospective and potential mergers and acquisitions, our defense against a hostile tender offer and a proxy contest, and related professional fees of $32.9\nmillion, restructuring costs and higher costs driven by our recent acquisitions, partially offset by reduction in expenses due to our divestiture of MakerBot\nin late August 2022.\n76\n• Net loss amounted to $123.1 million or basic and diluted net loss per share of $1.79 in 2023, compared to net loss of $29.0 million, or basic and diluted\nnet loss per share of $0.44, in 2022, which was mainly attributable to higher costs related to prospective and potential mergers and acquisitions,\ntermination costs related to the termination of our merger transaction with Desktop Metal, our defense against a hostile tender offer and our proxy contest\nand related professional fees, lower gross profit and increased amounts for our share in losses of associated companies.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash amounted to $82.9 million and short-term deposits amounted to 80.0 million as of December 31, 2023,\nwhich, when aggregated together, reflected a decrease of 165.3 million compared to the corresponding total amount as of December 31, 2022. The decrease in\ncash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term deposits in 2023 was due to increased cash used in operating, investing and financing activities, which\namounted to $61.6 million, $3.8 million and $1.5 million, respectively, in 2023.\nResults of Operations\nWe are providing within this section a discussion and analysis of our historical statement of operations data in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United State of America, or GAAP. While our financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report include data for each of the three years\nended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the discussion and analysis contained in this Item 5.A is limited to a comparison of our results of operations for the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For a discussion and analysis of our results for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a comparison of those results\nwith those of the year ended December 31, 2021, please see “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—A. Operating Results—Results of\nOperations” in our annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022, which we filed with the SEC on March 3, 2023.\nThe following table sets forth certain financial data derived from our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, presented as percentages of\nour revenues for the years indicated:\nYear ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenues 100.0% 100.0%\nCost of revenues 57.5% 57.6%\nGross profit 42.5% 42.4%\nResearch and development, net 15.0% 14.3%\nSelling, general and administrative 41.5% 37.0%\nOperating loss (14.0%) (8.8%)\nGain from deconsolidation of subsidiary 0.0% 6.0%\nFinancial income, net 0.5% 0.0%\nLoss before income taxes (13.5%) (2.7%)\nTaxes on income 0.9% 0.8%\nShare in net losses of associated companies (5.2%) (0.9%)\nNet loss (19.6%) (4.4%)\nNet loss attributable to Stratasys Ltd.

The decrease was mainly attributable to longer sales cycles as well as the\nimpact of the divestiture of MakerBot of $14.8 million.\nConsumables revenues increased by $18.5 million, or 8.2%, in 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to revenues driven from our\nrecently acquired entities, and higher utilization rates of systems as initial materials are replenished in an aggregate amount of $22.9 million, partially offset by the\nimpact of divestiture of MakerBot of $4.1 million.\nServices Revenues\nServices revenues (including Stratasys Direct, maintenance contracts, time and materials and other services) decreased by $5.5 million, or 2.8%, in 2023 as\ncompared to 2022. The decrease in services revenues was mainly driven by the impact of divestiture of MakerBot (which accounted for a decrease of $4.2 million),\nand a decrease in SDM revenues as a result of divestitures of several businesses in SDM, partially offset by higher revenues generated from maintenance contracts\non our systems, which increased by 4.5%.\nRevenues by Region\nRevenue amounts and the percentage of our overall revenues by region for the last two years, as well as the percentage change in revenue amounts for each such\nregion from year to year, were as follows:\n78\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRevenue Revenue\namount % of amount % of\n(U.S. $ in overall (U.S. $ in overall\nthousands) revenues thousands) revenues\nAmericas* $ 389,770 62.1 % $ 415,428 63.8 %\nEMEA 155,942 24.8 % 141,660 21.7 %\nAsia Pacific 81,886 13.0 % 94,395 14.5 %\n$ 627,598 100.0 % $ 651,483 100.0 %\n*Consists of the United States, Canada and Latin America\nRevenues in the Americas region decreased by $25.7 million, or 6.2%, to $389.8 million in 2023 compared to $415.4 million in 2022. The decrease was mainly\nattributable to the divestiture of MakerBot, decrease in SDM revenues and longer sales cycles, partially offset by higher revenues driven from our recently acquired\nentities and higher utilization rates of systems which requires that initial materials be replenished.\nRevenues in the EMEA region increased by $14.3 million, or 10.1%, to $155.9 million in 2023 compared to $141.7 million in 2022.The increase was primarily\ndriven by higher consumables revenues attributable to our recently acquired entities and higher utilization rates of systems which requires that initial materials be\nreplenished, partially offset by the divestiture of MakerBot.\nRevenues in the Asia Pacific region decreased by $12.5 million, or 13.3%, to $81.9 million in 2023 compared to $94.4 million in 2022.The decrease was mainly\nattributable to longer sales cycles and unfavorable exchange rates, partially offset by higher revenues provided by our recently acquired entities.\nGross Profit\nGross profit from our products and services for the last two years, as well as the percentage change from year to year, were as\nPercentage Change (later\nYear Ended December 31, year compared to earlier)\n2023 2022 2023-2022\nGross profit attributable to:\nProducts $ 207,231 $ 217,523 (4.7)%\nServices $ 59,793 $ 58,944 1.4 %\n$ 267,024 $ 276,467 (3.4)%\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues for our products and services for the last two years, as well as the percentage change from year to year, were as follows:\n79\nPercentage Change (later\nyear compared to\nYear Ended December 31, earlier)\nU.S. $ in\nthousands\nGross profit as a percentage of revenues from: 2023 2022 2023-2022\nProducts 47.8 % 48.1 % (0.7)%\nServices 30.8 % 29.6 % 4.3 %\nTotal gross profit 42.5 % 42.4 % 0.3 %\nGross profit attributable to products revenues decreased by $10.3 million, or 4.7%, to $207.2 million in 2023 compared to $217.5 million in 2022. Gross profit\nattributable to products revenues as a percentage of revenues decreased to 47.8% in 2023 compared to 48.1% in 2022. Our gross profit from products revenues\ndecreased mainly as a result of lower year over year products sales and the divestiture of MakerBot, partially offset by lower amortization expenses and higher\nrevenues driven by our recent acquisitions.\nGross profit attributable to services revenues increased by $0.8 million, or 1.4%, to $59.8 million in 2023 compared to $58.9 million in 2022. Gross profit from\nservices as a percentage of services revenues in 2023 increased to 30.8% as compared to 29.6% in 2022. Our gross profit from services revenues increased mainly\nas a result of favorable product mix and our restructuring of SDM, in an aggregate amount of $7.6 million partially offset by higher restructuring cost.\nAs the above percentages evidence, our gross margin, which has been a major focus for us, did not change in a material manner in 2023 compared to 2022,\ndespite global economic headwinds caused by inflation and European currency depreciation against the U.S. dollar. This was largely due to our use of price\nincreases on our products and services to help to offset cost pressures. As our new technologies ramp and our operational efficiencies continue, we expect that our\ngross margin will strengthen in the coming years.\nOperating Expenses\nThe amount of each type of operating expense for the last two years, as well as the percentage change between such annual periods, and total operating\nexpenses as a percentage of our total revenues in each such year, were as follows:\nChange from earlier to later year, as\nYear Ended December 31, a % of amount in earlier year\n2023 2022 2023-2022\nU.S. $ in thousands\nResearch and development, net $ 94,425 $ 92,876 1.7 %\nSelling, general and administrative 260,179 240,750 8.1 %\n$ 354,604 $ 333,626 6.3 %\nPercentage of revenues 56.5 % 51.2 %\n80\nOperating expenses were $354.6 million in 2023 compared to operating expenses of $333.6 million in 2022. The increase in operating expenses was primarily\ndriven by costs related to prospective and potential mergers and acquisitions, our defense against a hostile tender offer and a proxy contest, and related professional\nfees, restructuring costs of $32.9 million and higher costs driven by our recent acquisitions in an amount of $11.7 million, partially offset by reduction in expenses\ndue to our divestiture of MakerBot in late August 2022.\nResearch and development expenses, net, increased by $1.5 million, or 1.7%, in 2023 compared to 2022. Research and development expenses, net, as a percentage\nof revenues increased to 15.0% in 2023 compared to 14.3% in 2022. The increase in research and development expenses, net in 2023 was mainly attributable to\nhigher costs driven by our recent acquisitions of $5.8 million partially offset by the divestiture of MakerBot.\nWe continue to invest in strategic long-term initiatives that include advancements in our core FDM and PolyJet technologies and in our new powder-based and\nphotopolymer-based, SAF and P3 technologies, advanced composite materials, software and development of new applications that will enhance our current\nsolutions offerings.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in 2023 increased by $19.4 million, or 8.1%, to $260.2 million, compared to $240.8 million in 2022.The amount of\nselling, general and administrative expenses constituted 41.5% of our revenues in 2023, as compared to 37.0% in 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to\ncosts related to prospective and potential mergers and acquisitions, defense against hostile tender offer, proxy contest and related professional fees of $32.9 million,\nas well as restructuring costs, partially offset by a reduction of selling, general and administrative costs due to our divestiture of MakerBot in August 2022 and\nreduction in contingent consideration liabilities in amount of $4.0 million.\nOperating Loss\nOperating loss and operating loss as a percentage of our total revenues for the last two years, as well as the percentage change in operating loss between those\nyears, were as follows:\nChange from earlier to later year, as a\nYear Ended December 31, % of amount in earlier year\n2023 2022 2023-2022\nU.S. $ in thousands\nOperating loss (87,580) (57,159) 53.2 %\nPercentage of revenues (14.0 %) (8.8 %)\nOperating loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $87.6 million as compared to an operating loss of $57.2 million for the year ended December 31,\n2022. Our operating loss increased both on an absolute basis, and as a percentage of our revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2022, for the reasons described in the discussion of the above line items.\nGain From Deconsolidation Of Subsidiary\nOn August 31, 2022, we completed the previously-announced merger of our subsidiary MakerBot with Ultimaker, into a new company that had been created\nunder the name Ultimaker. The transaction was accounted for as an equity method investment, and, accordingly, we recorded an investment of $105.6 million, and\na net gain of $39.1 million from the deconsolidation of MakerBot.\n81\nFinancial Income (Expenses), net\nFinancial income, net, which were primarily comprised of foreign currencies effects, interest income and interest expense, amounted to $3.0 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, compared to financial income, net, of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense and income tax expense as a percentage of net loss before income taxes for the last two years, as well as the percentage change in income\ntaxes between those years, were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2023-2022\nU.S. $ in thousands % Change in 2023\nLoss before income taxes $ (84,587) $ (17,794) 375.4 %\nIncome tax benefit (expense) $ 5,782 $ 5,454 6.0 %\nAs a percentage of loss before income taxes (6.8 %) (30.7 %)\nWe had an effective tax rate of (6.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to an effective tax rate of (30.7)% for the year ended December 31,\n2022. Our effective tax rate in 2023 was primarily impacted by the geographic mix of foreign taxable earnings and losses, our valuation allowance as well as\nchanges in uncertain tax position.\nOur effective tax rate is based on recurring factors, including the geographic mix of foreign taxable income and loss, as well as nonrecurring items that may not\nbe predictable.\nFor a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the Israeli statutory rate of 23% and for further explanation of our provision for income taxes, refer to Note\n10 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report.\nShare in net Losses of Associated Companies\nShare in net losses of associated companies reflects our proportionate share of the net losses of unconsolidated entities accounted for by using the equity method of\naccounting. During 2023, we had net losses of our equity method investments in a total amount of $32.7 million, compared to a loss of $5.7 million in 2022. The\nforegoing losses including impairment charges in amount of $13.9 million, were mainly attributable to our equity investment the new merged entity Ultimaker\n(which was the surviving entity following a merger between it and MakerBot) following the deconsolidation, in 2022, of MakerBot, which was previously held as\na subsidiary of Stratasys. refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report.\nNet Loss and Net Loss Per Share\nNet loss, net loss as a percentage of our total revenues, and diluted net loss per share, for the last two years, as well as the percentage change in net loss between\nthose years, were as follows:\n82\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2023-2022\nU.S. $ in thousands % Change in 2023\nNet loss (123,074) (28,974) 324.8 %\nPercentage of revenues (19.6)% (4.4)%\nBasic and diluted net loss per share $ (1.79) $ (0.44) (55.4)%\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $123.1 million, as compared to $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly\nattributable to higher costs related to prospective and potential mergers and acquisitions, termination costs related to the termination of our merger transaction with\nDesktop Metal, our defense against a hostile tender offer and our proxy contest and related professional fees of 32.9 million, lower gross profit and increased\namounts for our share in losses of associated companies\nDiluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.79 and $0.44, respectively The weighted average, basic and diluted number\nof shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 68.7 million, compared to 66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following non-GAAP data for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which excludes certain items as described below, are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful information for investors and shareholders of our company in\ngauging our results of operations (i) on an ongoing basis after excluding mergers, acquisitions and divestments related expense or gains and restructuring-related\ncharges or gains, legal provisions and (ii) excluding non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expenses, acquired intangible assets amortization, including\nintangible assets amortization related to equity method investments, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, revaluation of investments and the\ncorresponding tax effect of those items. The items eliminated in our non-GAAP adjustments either do not reflect actual cash outlays that impact our liquidity and\nour financial condition or have a non-recurring impact on our statement of operations, as assessed by management. These non-GAAP financial measures are\npresented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses our performance for internal planning and forecasting purposes. The limitations\nof using these non-GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of our results of operations without including all items\nindicated above during a period, which may not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in our industry. Investors and other readers\nshould consider non-GAAP measures only as supplements to, not as substitutes for or as superior measures to, the measures of financial performance prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Reconciliation between results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is provided in the table below.\n83\nReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results of Operations\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2023 Non-GAAP 2023\nGAAP Adjustments Non-GAAP\nU.S. dollars and shares in thousands (except per share amounts)\nGross profit (1) $ 267,024 $ 35,764 $ 302,788\nOperating income (loss) (1,2) (87,580) 100,207 12,627\nNet income (loss) attributable to\nStratasys Ltd.

In addition, due to competition, uncertain market acceptance and\nother factors, we may be required to reduce prices for our products in the future. Since 2019, it has also been useful to gauge the variability of our operating results\non a linear basis, for each quarter compared to the previous one, in addition to on a year-over-year basis, compared to the corresponding period of the prior year.\nWe have not seen a steady pattern as to the level of demand for our products in particular quarters of the year since 2019. Nevertheless, in our outlook for 2024, we\nexpect our revenues to grow sequentially, largely because of expected new product introductions later as the year progresses.\nOur future results will be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to: increase the number of products sold; develop, introduce and deliver new\nproducts on a timely basis; accurately anticipate customer demand patterns; and manage future inventory levels in line with anticipated demand. Our results may\nalso be affected by competitive factors, the extent to which our cost controls plan succeeds, the availability of working capital, results of litigation, the enforcement\nof intellectual property rights, currency exchange rate fluctuations, commodity prices and economic conditions in the geographic areas in which we operate. Macro\nfactors, including global economic headwinds caused by inflation, changes in interest rates, and supply chain conditions, as impacted by geopolitical developments\nsuch as the status of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and U.S.-China relations, and macro factors particular to our industry, such as the extent of growth of the 3D\nprinting market generally, may also impact our operating results. There can be no assurance that our historical performance in revenues, gross profit and net\nincome (loss) will improve, or that revenues, gross profit and net income (loss) in any particular quarter will improve, over the results reflected in preceding\nquarters, including comparable quarters of previous years. See Item 3.D - “Risk Factors” above\nEffective Corporate Tax Rate\nSee “Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs — General Corporate Tax Structure in Israel” in Item 4.B above for a discussion of the general tax\nstructure in Israel and applicable corporate tax rates.\nIn 2023, we generated losses mainly from our Israeli parent company and its major subsidiaries, with no tax benefit being recorded for those losses, as the near-\nterm realization of these assets is uncertain.\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThis process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax\nand accounting purposes. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax laws or the results of final tax examinations and\nreviews.\nEffects of Government Regulations and Location on our Business\nFor a discussion of the effects of Israeli governmental regulation and our location in Israel on our business, see “Israeli Tax Considerations and Government\nPrograms” in Item 4.B above and the “Risks related to operations in Israel” in Item 3.D above.\n86\nInflation\nWe believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition during the three most recent fiscal years.\nForeign Currency Transactions\nSee “Foreign Currency Exchange Risk” in Item 11 below for a discussion of foreign currency transactions.\nB. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nA summary of our consolidated statement of cash flows for the last two years is set forth in the below table.While our financial statements included in Item 18\nof this annual report include cash flow data for each of the three years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the discussion contained in this Item 5.B is\nlimited to a comparison of our liquidity and capital resources— including cash flows— for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. For a discussion of our\ncash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a comparison of those cash flows with those for the year ended December 31, 2022, please see “Item 5.\nOperating and Financial Review and Prospects—B. Liquidity and Capital Resources” in our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwhich we filed with the SEC on March 3, 2023.\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nU.S $ in thousands\nNet loss $ (123,074) $ (28,974)\nImpairment of other long-lived assets 4,443 3,865\nDepreciation and amortization 48,973 59,769\nStock-based compensation 31,614 33,461\nForeign currency transactions gain (loss) 636 9,090\nGain from deconsolidation of subsidiary — (39,136)\nDeferred income taxes, net and uncertain tax positions (1,764) 926\nOther non-cash items, net 18,051 (9,079)\nChange in working capital and other items (40,524) (105,327)\nNet cash used in by operating activities (61,645) (75,405)\nNet cash used in investing activities (3,834) (7,213)\nNet cash used in financing activities (1,516) (2,769)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (827) (7,220)\nNet change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (67,822) (92,607)\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, beginning of year 150,686 243,293\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, end of year $82,864 $150,686\nOur cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances decreased to $82.9 million as of December 31, 2023 as compared to $150.7 million as of December 31,\n2022.\nThe decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in 2023 was mainly due to cash flows used in operating activities.\n87\nCash flows from operating activities\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nWe used $61.6 million of cash in our operating activities during 2023. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of $123.1 million and negative\nchanges in our working capital of $40.5 million, partially offset by depreciation, amortization and impairment charges of long-lived assets in an aggregate amount\nof $53.4 million, stock-based compensation of $31.6 million, deferred income taxes of $1.8 million and $18.1 million of changes in other non-cash items, net.\nChanges in working capital of 40.5 million were mainly driven by an increase in accounts receivables of $25.7 million, decrease in accounts payable of $27.4\nmillion and decrease in other non current liabilities of $9.2 million, partially offset by an increase in other non current assets of $11.0 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nWe used $75.4 million of cash in our operating activities during 2022. Cash used in operating activities reflected our net loss of $29.0 million, negative changes\nin our working capital of $105.3 million, depreciation, amortization and impairment charges of long-lived assets in an aggregate amount of $63.6 million, stock-\nbased compensation of $33 million and foreign currency transactions gains of $9.1 million, which were partially offset by $39.1 million gain from deconsolidation\nof our former subsidiary MakerBot and $9.1 million of changes in other non-cash items, net. Changes in working capital of $105.3 million were mainly driven by\nan increase in inventory of $87.3 million as a result of increased purchases aimed at building up our inventory, as well as an increase in accounts receivables of\n$15.4 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $20.9 million, as a result of an increase in the level of our ongoing operations in the year ended\nDecember 31,2022.\nCash flows from investing activities\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nWe used $3.8 million of cash in our investing activities during 2023. The net cash use during 2023 mostly reflected $72.1 million used for investments in\nconsolidated entities and $13.6 million that we invested for the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by net proceeds from short-term bank deposits\nof $97.4 million.\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nWe used $7.2 million of cash in our investing activities during 2022. The net cash use during 2022 mostly reflected $69.1 million used for investments in\nunconsolidated entities (mainly Ultimaker), and $13.6 million that we invested for the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by net proceeds that we\nwithdrew from short-term bank deposits.\nCash flows from financing activities\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nWe used $1.5 million of cash in our financing activities during 2023. These financing activities were mostly related to contingent consideration that we paid for\nacquisitions.\nYear ended December 31, 2022\nWe used $2.8 million of cash in our financing activities during 2022. These financing activities were mostly related to contingent consideration that we paid for\nacquisitions.\n88\nCapital resources and capital expenditures\nOur total current assets amounted to $560.1 million as of December 31, 2023, of which $162.9 consisted of cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and\nrestricted cash. Total current liabilities amounted to $176.4 million as of December 31, 2023.\nMost of our cash and cash equivalents are held in banks in Israel and the U.S.\nThe credit risk related to our accounts receivable is limited due to the relatively large number of customers and their wide geographic distribution. In addition,\nwe seek to reduce the credit exposures of our accounts receivable by imposing credit limits, conducting ongoing credit evaluation, and by implementing account\nmonitoring procedures, as well as by carrying credit insurance for many of our customers.\nWe believe that we will have adequate cash and cash equivalents to fund our ongoing operations and that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy\nour working capital and capital expenditures needs, as well as our debt requirements, for the next twelve months.\nAdditional factors potentially impacting capital resources\nWe are obligated to our suppliers under ordinary course purchase orders in an aggregate amount of approximately $140.8 million as of December 31, 2023. All\nof those obligations will become due over the course of the 2024 year.\nWe have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our acquisitions. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events and, given the nature of these events, it is unclear when, if ever, we may be required to pay such amounts. The total contingent payments\ncould reach an aggregate amount of up to $104.4 million.\nC. Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, Etc.\nFor a discussion of our research and development policies, see “Research and Development” and “Regulation— Israeli Tax Considerations and Government\nPrograms – Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments” in Item 4.B above and the “Risks related to operations in Israel” in Item 3.D above.\nD. Trend Information.\nFor trend information, see the Risk Factors described in Item 3.D above, the “Overview” and “Operating Results” sections of this Item 5 - “Operating and\nFinancial Review and Prospects” and Item 4 - “Information on the Company” above.\nE. Critical Accounting Estimates\nFor a description of our significant accounting policies, see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 18 of this annual report.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain\ncircumstances that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. Actual results may differ from these\nestimates. We base our judgments on our experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\n89\nOf our policies, the following are considered the most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as they require the application of the\nmost subjective and complex judgment, involving critical accounting estimates and assumptions impacting our consolidated financial statements. We have applied\nour policies and critical accounting estimates consistently across our businesses:\n• Business combination\n• Intangibles\n• Goodwill\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the\nuncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ materially from the estimates we use in applying these policies.\nBusiness combination\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combination”, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nbased on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded\nas goodwill.\nFair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nIn the Company’s recent acquisitions, intangible assets and goodwill represented a majority of the assets acquired. Assessing fair values of intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination involves significant judgment about future events and uncertainties and depends on estimates and assumptions. Significant\nestimates utilized in valuating intangible assets include discount rates and future expected cash flow, which rely upon assumptions such as the useful life of the\nassets, revenue growth rates and margins projections, technological obsolescence and income tax rate assumptions.\nContingent consideration incurred in a business combination is included as part of the consideration transferred and recorded at fair value as of the acquisition\ndate.\nEstimating the fair value involves significant judgment and is based on significant assumptions relating to the estimate, such as discount rates, internal cash\nflows forecast for the relevant period during which the financial metrics should be achieved and the timing and amounts of the contingent payments.\nAmounts recorded in a business combination in certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair values during the measurement\nperiod, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date may become available. In\naddition, each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues the contingent consideration payments and deferred payments which are classified as liabilities\nand records the changes in their fair value in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nOn August 31, 2022, Stratasys completed the merger of MakerBot (previously, a fully owned subsidiary) with Ultimaker, which together formed a new entity\nunder the name Ultimaker. The Company accounts for its investment in the combined company Ultimaker according to the equity method in accordance with ASC\nTopic 323, as it has retained the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control the new entity. The Company recognized an equity method investment\nin a total amount of $105.6 million comprised of the assumed fair value of the MakerBot shares and additional amount invested in cash by the Company,\nrepresenting a share of 46.5% in the new entity.\nOn April 3, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the additive manufacturing materials business of Covestro AG for an aggregate purchase price of\n$60.5 million, including cash and shares and we are obligated to pay additional payments.\n90\nDuring 2023, the Company completed several transactions, including acquisitions of an entity and additional assets, for a total consideration of $22 million.\nSee note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on the business combination transactions.\nIntangibles\nMost of our identifiable intangible assets were recognized as part of business combinations we have executed in the current and prior periods. Our identifiable\nintangible assets are considered definite life intangible assets and are primarily comprised of developed technology, trademarks and trade names, customer\nrelationships and patents. Definite life intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of useful life.\nOur determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Refer to the “Business\ncombination” section above. We believe that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and\nestimates that a market participant would use. Should conditions differ from management’s estimates at the time of the acquisition, including changes in volume or\ntiming to current expectations of future revenue growth rates and forecasted margins, or changes in market factors outside of our control, such as discount rates,\nmaterial write-downs of intangible assets may be required, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of intangible assets may not be recoverable. We review the carrying\namounts of our intangible assets for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable. Impairment indicators may include any significant changes in the manner of our use of the assets or the strategy of our overall business, certain\nreorganization initiatives, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant decline in our share price for a sustained period.\nWhen such events or changes in circumstances occur, we compare the carrying amounts of the asset or assets groups with their respective estimated\nundiscounted future cash flows. If the asset or assets group are determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying\namount of the asset or assets group exceed their fair value.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not record any impairment charges related to our definite life intangible assets.\nIn 2023, additional intangible assets of $30.6 million were recognized by us as part of our assets and other acquisitions, as mentioned above.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill reflects the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair\nvalues of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or whenever events\nor circumstances present an indication of impairment. The goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 resulted from our recent acquisitions. No goodwill\nimpairment was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. In 2023, additional goodwill of $34.8 million were recognized by us as part of our\nacquisitions, as mentioned above.\n91\nDetermining the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgment, including judgments about the appropriate terminal growth rates, weighted\naverage costs of capital and the amounts and timing of projected future cash flows. Fair value determinations are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions,\nestimates, and market factors. Projected future cash flows are based on our most recent budget, forecasts and strategic plans as well as certain growth rate\nassumptions. Potential changes in our costs and operating structure, the expected timing of utilization of synergies, strategic opportunities, negative effect of\nexchange rates and overall weakness in the 3D printing marketplace, could negatively impact our near-term cash-flow projections and could trigger a potential\nimpairment of our goodwill. In addition, failure to execute our strategic plans as well as increases in weighted average costs of capital could negatively impact the\nfair value of our reporting units, and increase the risk of goodwill impairment in the future.\nWe will continue to monitor the fair value of our reporting units to determine whether events and changes in circumstances such as further deterioration in the\nbusiness climate or operating results, further significant decline in our share price, changes in management’s business strategy or downward changes of our cash\nflows projections, warrant further interim impairment testing.\nSee note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further details on the goodwill impairment test in 2023.\nITEM 6.

All other executive officers are also appointed by\nour board of directors, subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreements that we may enter into with them.\nUnder our amended articles, our board of directors must consist of at least seven and not more than 11 directors, including, to the extent applicable, at least two\nexternal directors required to be elected under the Companies Law.\nIn May 2016, we elected to be governed by a then-newly-adopted exemption under the Companies Law regulations that exempts us from appointing external\ndirectors and from complying with the Companies Law requirements related to the composition of the audit committee and compensation committee of our board\nof directors. Our eligibility for that exemption is conditioned upon: (i) the continued listing of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market (or one of a few\nselect other non-Israeli stock exchanges); (ii) there not being a controlling shareholder (generally understood to be a 25% or greater shareholder) of our company\nunder the Companies Law; and (iii) our compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules requirements as to the composition of (a) our board of directors-which requires\nthat we maintain a majority of independent directors (as defined under the Nasdaq Listing Rules) on our board of directors and (b) the audit and compensation\ncommittees of our board of directors (which require that such committees consist solely of independent directors (at least three and two members, respectively), as\ndescribed under the Nasdaq Listing Rules). At the time that it determined to exempt our company from the external director requirement, our board affirmatively\ndetermined that we meet the conditions for exemption from the external director requirement, including that a majority of the members of our board, along with\neach of the members of the audit and compensation committees of the board, are independent under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nAs a result of our election to be exempt from the external director requirement under the Companies Law, each of our directors is elected annually, at our annual\ngeneral meeting of shareholders. The vote required for the election of each director is a majority of the voting power represented at the meeting and voting on the\nelection proposal. Following our 2023 annual general meeting of shareholders that took place in August 2023, as well as an appointment and resignation of board\nmembers in November 2023, the current members of our board consist of the Chairman— Dov Ofer, S. Scott Crump, Aris Kekedjian, John J. McEleney (Chairman\nof the Compensation Committee), David Reis, Michael Schoellhorn, Yair Seroussi (Chairman of the Audit Committee) and Adina Shorr. For more information,\nplease see “Election of Directors” in Item 10.B (“Memorandum and Articles of Association”) below.\nOur board of directors may appoint directors to fill vacancies on the board, for a term of office equal to the remaining period of the term of office of the\ndirector(s) whose office(s) have been vacated.\n100\nIn accordance with the exemption available to foreign private issuers under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we do not follow the requirements of the Nasdaq rules\nwith regard to the process of nominating directors. Instead, we follow Israeli law and practice, in accordance with which our board of directors (based on the\nrecommendation of the executive committee thereof) is authorized to recommend to our shareholders director nominees for election. Under the Companies Law\nand our amended articles, nominations for directors may also be made by any shareholder holding at least one percent (1%) of our outstanding voting power.\nHowever, any such shareholder may make such a nomination only if a written notice of such shareholder’s intent to make such nomination (together with certain\ndocumentation required under the Companies Law) has been delivered to our registered Israeli office within seven days after we publish notice of our upcoming\nannual general meeting (or within 14 days after we publish a preliminary notification of an upcoming annual general meeting).\nIn addition to its role in making director nominations, under the Companies Law, our board of directors must determine the minimum number of directors who\nare required to have accounting and financial expertise. Under applicable regulations, a director with accounting and financial expertise is a director who, by\nreason of his or her education, professional experience and skill, has a high level of proficiency in and understanding of business accounting matters and financial\nstatements. See “—External Directors” in this Item 6.C below. He or she must be able to thoroughly comprehend the financial statements of the company and\ninitiate debate regarding the manner in which financial information is presented. In determining the number of directors required to have such expertise, our board\nof directors must consider, among other things, the type and size of our company and the scope and complexity of its operations. Our board of directors has\ndetermined that our company requires one director with such expertise.\nExternal Directors\nUnder the Companies Law, the boards of directors of companies whose shares are publicly traded, including companies with shares traded in the United States,\nare generally required to include at least two members who qualify as external directors.\nOur election to exempt our company from compliance with the external director requirement can be reversed at any time by our board of directors, in which\ncase we would need to hold a shareholder meeting to once again appoint external directors, whose election would be for a three-year term. The election of each\nexternal director would require a majority vote of the shares present and voting at a shareholders meeting, provided that either:\n• the majority voted in favor of election includes a majority of the shares held by non-controlling shareholders who do not have a personal interest in the\nelection of the external director (other than a personal interest not deriving from a relationship with a controlling shareholder) that are voted at the meeting,\nexcluding abstentions, which we refer to as a disinterested majority; or\n• the total number of shares held by non-controlling, disinterested shareholders (as described in the previous bullet-point) voted against the election of the\ndirector does not exceed two percent (2%) of the aggregate voting rights in the company.\nThe term “controlling shareholder” is defined in the Companies Law as a shareholder with the ability to direct the activities of the company, other than by virtue\nof being an office holder. A shareholder is presumed to be a controlling shareholder if the shareholder holds 50% or more of the voting rights in a company or has\nthe right to appoint the majority of the directors of the company or its general manager (i.e., its CEO).\nFor further information concerning the Companies Law provisions related to external directors, please see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management and\nEmployees-C. Board Practices-Board of Directors-External Directors” in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2015, which we filed\nwith the SEC on March 21, 2016.\n101\nBoard Committees\nAudit Committee\nUnder the Companies Law, the board of directors of a public company must appoint an audit committee. The audit committee must consist of at least three\ndirectors. To the extent a company is required to appoint external directors, this committee must include all of the external directors, one of whom must serve as\nchairman of the committee. There are additional requirements as to the composition of the audit committee under the Companies Law. However, when we elected\nto exempt our company from the external director requirement, we concurrently elected to exempt our company from all of such requirements (which exemption is\nconditioned on our fulfillment of all Nasdaq Listing Requirements related to the composition of the audit committee).\nThe members of our audit committee consist of Aris Kekedjian, John McEleney and Yair Seroussi. Mr. Seroussi serves as chairman of the committee. Our board\nof directors has determined that each of Messrs. Kekedjian, McEleney and Seroussi meets the independence requirements set forth in the Listing Rules of the\nNasdaq Stock Market and in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.\nOur board of directors has determined that Mr. Seroussi qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under Item 16A of the SEC’s Form 20-F,\nand has the requisite financial sophistication set forth in the Nasdaq rules and regulations.\nOur board of directors has adopted an audit committee charter that sets forth the responsibilities of the audit committee consistent with the rules of the SEC and\nthe Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, as well as the requirements for such committee under the Companies Law, including the following responsibilities:\n• oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm and recommending the engagement, compensation or termination of engagement of our\nindependent registered public accounting firm to the board of directors in accordance with Israeli law;\n• recommending the engagement or termination of the person filling the office of our internal auditor; and\n• recommending the terms of audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm for pre-approval by our board of\ndirectors.\nOur audit committee provides assistance to our board of directors in fulfilling its legal and fiduciary obligations in matters involving our accounting, auditing,\nfinancial reporting, internal control and legal compliance functions by pre-approving the services performed by our independent accountants and reviewing their\nreports regarding our accounting practices and systems of internal control over financial reporting. Our audit committee also oversees the audit efforts of our\nindependent accountants and takes those actions that it deems necessary to satisfy itself that the accountants are independent of management.\n102\nUnder the Companies Law, our audit committee is responsible for (i) determining whether there are deficiencies in the business management practices of our\ncompany, including in consultation with our internal auditor or the independent auditor, and making recommendations to the board of directors to improve such\npractices, (ii) determining whether to approve certain related party transactions (including transactions in which an office holder has a personal interest and\nwhether such transaction is extraordinary) (see “-Approval of related party transactions under Israeli Law” below in this Item 6.C), (iii) determining standards and\npolicies for determining whether a transaction with a controlling shareholder or a transaction in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest is deemed\ninsignificant or not and the approval requirements (including, potentially, the approval of the audit committee) for transactions that are not insignificant including\nthe types of transactions that are not insignificant, (iv) where the board of directors approves the working plan of the internal auditor, to examine such working plan\nbefore its submission to the board and propose amendments thereto, (v) examining our internal controls and internal auditor’s performance, including whether the\ninternal auditor has sufficient resources and tools to dispose of its responsibilities, (vi) examining the scope of our auditor’s work and compensation and submitting\na recommendation with respect thereto to our board of directors or shareholders, depending on which of them is considering the appointment of our auditor and\n(vii) establishing procedures for the handling of employees’ complaints as to the management of our business and the protection to be provided to such employees.\nOur audit committee may not approve an action or a related party transaction, or take any other action required under the Companies Law, unless at the time of\napproval a majority of the committee’s members are present, which majority consists of unaffiliated directors including at least one external director.\nCompensation Committee and Compensation Policy\nFollowing the adoption of a December 2012 amendment to the Companies Law, we appointed a compensation committee and established a policy regarding the\nterms of engagement of office holders, or a compensation policy. Such compensation policy was set by our board, after considering the recommendations of our\nnewly-appointed compensation committee, and was approved by our shareholders in September 2013. In February 2015 and again in September 2018 and\nNovember 2021, following approval by our compensation committee and board, our shareholders approved amended and restated versions of our compensation\npolicy at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders and at our 2018 and 2021 annual general meetings of shareholders (respectively).\nThe compensation policy serves as the basis for decisions concerning the financial terms of employment or engagement of our office holders, including\nexculpation, insurance, indemnification or any monetary payment or obligation of payment in respect of employment or engagement. The compensation policy\nalso relates to certain factors, including advancement of our objectives, our business and our long-term strategy, and creation of appropriate incentives for\nexecutives. It also considers, among other things, our risk management, size and the nature of our operations. The compensation policy furthermore considers the\nfollowing additional factors:\n• the knowledge, skills, expertise and accomplishments of the relevant director or executive;\n• the director’s or executive’s roles and responsibilities and prior compensation agreements with him or her;\n• the relationship between the terms offered and the average compensation of the other employees of our company, including those (if any) employed\nthrough manpower companies;\n• the impact of disparities in salary upon work relationships in our company;\n• the possibility of reducing variable compensation at the discretion of the board of directors; and the possibility of setting a limit on the exercise value of\nnon-cash variable compensation; and\n• as to severance compensation, the period of service of the director or executive, the terms of his or her compensation during such service period, our\ncompany’s performance during that period of service, the person’s contribution towards our company’s achievement of its goals and the maximization of\nits profits, and the circumstances under which the person is leaving our company.\n103\nThe compensation policy also includes the following principles:\n• the link between variable compensation and long-term performance and measurable criteria;\n• the relationship between variable and fixed compensation, and the ceiling for the value of variable compensation;\n• the conditions under which a director or executive would be required to repay compensation paid to him or her if it was later shown that the data upon\nwhich such compensation was based was inaccurate and was required to be restated in our financial statements; and\n• the minimum holding or vesting period for variable, equity-based compensation.\nThe compensation policy must also consider appropriate incentives from a long-term perspective and maximum limits for severance compensation.\nUnder the December 2012 amendment to the Companies Law, our compensation committee is responsible for recommending the compensation policy to our\nboard of directors for its approval (and subsequent approval by our shareholders) and is charged with duties related to the compensation policy and to the\ncompensation of our office holders as well as functions related to approval of the terms of engagement of office holders, including:\n• recommending whether our compensation policy should continue in effect, if the then-current policy has a term of greater than three (3) years (approval of\nthe continuation of an existing compensation policy for a company such as ours must in any case occur every three years);\n• recommending to our board periodic updates to the compensation policy;\n• assessing implementation of the compensation policy; and\n• determining whether the compensation terms of the chief executive officer of our company need not be brought to approval of the shareholders (under\nspecial circumstances).\nAs to the composition of the compensation committee, under the Companies Law, if a company is required to appoint external directors, the committee must\nconsist of at least three (3) members, including all of the external directors, one of whom must serve as chairman of the committee. There are additional\nrequirements as to the composition of the audit committee under the Companies Law. However, when we elected to exempt our company from the external director\nrequirement, we concurrently elected to exempt our company from all of such requirements (including the three-member minimum). Our exemption under the\nCompanies Law is conditioned on our fulfillment of all Nasdaq listing requirements related to the composition of the compensation committee.\nThe compensation committee is subject to the same Companies Law restrictions as the audit committee as to who may not be present during committee\ndeliberations (as described under “-Approval of Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law—Fiduciary Duties of Directors and Executive Officers—Disclosure\nof Personal Interests of an Office Holder” below).\nThe Nasdaq Listing Rules also require that the compensation of the chief executive officer and all other executive officers of our company be determined, or be\nrecommended to the board for determination, by a compensation committee consisting solely of independent directors (subject to a minimum of two committee\nmembers).\nWe initially appointed our compensation committee in mid-2013. The committee currently consists of John McEleney, David Reis and Adina Shorr. Mr.\nMcEleney serves as chairman of the committee. Our board of directors has determined that each of Mr. McEleney, Mr. Reis and Ms. Shorr meets the independence\nrequirements set forth in the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act.\nOur board of directors has adopted a compensation committee charter that sets forth the responsibilities of the compensation committee consistent with the rules\nof the SEC and the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market, as well as the requirements for such committee under the Companies Law, including the following\nresponsibilities:\n104\n• review and approval of the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and each of our other executive officers;\n• approval of transactions involving office holders’ compensation (including non-employee director compensation) pursuant to Sections 272, 273, and 275 of\nthe Companies Law;\n• review, revision and approval of our compensation policy, and review, approval and oversight of the implementation of our compensation policies,\nincentive-based compensation plans and equity-based compensation plans; and\n• review and recommendation, to the entire board of directors, of our management succession planning.\nNominating Committee\nOur board of directors does not currently have a nominating committee, as director nominations are made in accordance with the terms of our articles, as\ndescribed in “- Board of Directors” above. We rely upon the exemption available to foreign private issuers under the Listing Rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market\nfrom the Nasdaq listing requirements related to independent director oversight of nominations to our board of directors and the adoption of a formal written charter\nor board resolution addressing the nominations process. Also see Item 16.G “Corporate Governance” below.\nInternal Auditor\nUnder the Companies Law, the board of directors of an Israeli public company must appoint an internal auditor recommended by the audit committee and\nnominated by the board of directors. An internal auditor may not be:\n• a person (or a relative of a person) who holds more than 5% of the company’s outstanding shares or voting rights;\n• a person (or a relative of a person) who has the power to appoint a director or the general manager of the company;\n• an office holder (including a director) of the company (or a relative thereof); or\n• a member of the company’s independent accounting firm, or anyone on his or her behalf.\nThe role of the internal auditor is to examine, among other things, our compliance with applicable law and orderly business procedures. Hila Barr-Hoisman, of\nDeloitte Israel & Co., has served as our internal auditor since May 2023.\nApproval of Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law\nFiduciary Duties of Directors and Executive Officers\nThe Companies Law codifies the fiduciary duties that office holders owe to a company. Each person listed in the table under Item 6.A “Directors and Senior\nManagement” is an office holder under the Companies Law.\nAn office holder’s fiduciary duties consist of a duty of care and a duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires an office holder to act with the level of care with\nwhich a reasonable office holder in the same position would have acted under the same circumstances. The duty of loyalty requires that an office holder act in good\nfaith and in the best interests of the company. The duty of care includes a duty to use reasonable means to obtain:\n• information on the advisability of a given action brought for his or her approval or performed by virtue of his or her position; and\n• all other important information pertaining to these actions.\n105\nThe duty of loyalty requires an office holder to act in good faith and for the benefit of the company, and includes a duty to:\n• refrain from any conflict of interest between the performance of his or her duties to the company and his or her other duties or personal affairs;\n• refrain from any activity that is competitive with the company;\n• refrain from exploiting any business opportunity of the company to receive a personal gain for himself or herself or others; and\n• disclose to the company any information or documents relating to the company’s affairs which the office holder received as a result of his or her position as\nan office holder.\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of an Office Holder\nThe Companies Law requires that an office holder promptly disclose to the board of directors any personal interest that he or she may have and all related\nmaterial information known to him or her and any documents concerning any existing or proposed transaction with the company. An interested office holder’s\ndisclosure must be made promptly and in any event no later than the first meeting of the board of directors at which the transaction is considered. A “personal\ninterest” includes an interest of any person in an act or transaction of a company, including a personal interest of one’s relative or of a corporate body in which such\nperson or a relative of such person is a 5% or greater shareholder, director or general manager or in which he or she has the right to appoint at least one director or\nthe general manager, but excluding a personal interest stemming from one’s ownership of shares in the company. A personal interest furthermore includes the\npersonal interest of a person for whom the office holder holds a voting proxy or the interest of the office holder with respect to his or her vote on behalf of the\nshareholder for whom he or she holds a proxy even if such shareholder itself has no personal interest in the approval of the matter. An office holder is not, however,\nobliged to disclose a personal interest if it derives solely from the personal interest of his or her relative in a transaction that is not considered an extraordinary\ntransaction. Under the Companies Law, an “extraordinary transaction” is defined as any of the following:\n• a transaction other than in the ordinary course of business;\n• a transaction that is not on market terms; or\n• a transaction that may have a material impact on a company’s profitability, assets or liabilities.\nIf it is determined that an office holder has a personal interest in a transaction, approval by the board of directors is required for the transaction, unless the\ncompany’s articles of association provide for a different method of approval. Further, so long as an office holder has disclosed his or her personal interest in a\ntransaction, the board of directors may approve an action by the office holder that would otherwise be deemed a breach of duty of loyalty. However, a company\nmay not approve a transaction or action that is adverse to the company’s interest or that is not performed by the office holder in good faith. Approval first by the\ncompany’s audit committee and subsequently by the board of directors is required for an extraordinary transaction with an office holder. Compensation of, or an\nundertaking to indemnify or insure, an office holder, requires approval by the compensation committee, the board of directors and, in certain cases (for directors,\nthe chief executive officer, and any executive officer whose compensation terms do not conform to the then-existing compensation policy) the shareholders, in that\norder. Compensation of an individual office holder, including the chief executive officer (but excluding a director), that does not conform to the company’s\ncompensation policy may be adopted under special circumstances despite failure to obtain shareholder approval if, following the relevant shareholder vote, the\ncompensation committee followed by the board once again approves the compensation, based on renewed and specific analysis of relevant factors.\n106\nGenerally, a person who has a personal interest in a matter which is considered at a meeting of the board of directors, the audit committee or compensation\ncommittee may not be present at such a meeting or vote on that matter unless a majority of the board, audit committee or compensation committee (as appropriate)\nhas a personal interest in the matter, or unless the chairman of the board, audit committee or compensation committee (as appropriate) determines that he or she\nshould be present in order to present the transaction that is subject to approval. If a majority of the members of the board, audit committee or compensation\ncommittee has a personal interest in the approval of a transaction, then all directors may participate in discussions of the board of directors, audit committee or\ncompensation committee on such transaction and the voting on approval thereof, but shareholder approval is also required for such transaction.\nDisclosure of Personal Interests of Controlling Shareholders\nPursuant to Israeli law, the disclosure requirements regarding personal interests that apply to directors and executive officers also apply to a controlling\nshareholder of a public company. In the context of a transaction involving a shareholder of the company, a controlling shareholder also includes any shareholder\nwho holds 25% or more of the voting rights if no other shareholder holds more than 50% of the voting rights. Two or more shareholders with a personal interest in\nthe approval of the same transaction are deemed to be a single shareholder and may be deemed a controlling shareholder for the purpose of approving such\ntransaction. Extraordinary transactions with a controlling shareholder or in which a controlling shareholder has a personal interest, or a transaction with a\ncontrolling shareholder or his or her relative, directly or indirectly, require the approval of the audit committee, the board of directors and the shareholders of the\ncompany, in that order. In addition, the shareholder approval must fulfill one of the following requirements:\n• a disinterested majority; or\n• the votes of shareholders who have no personal interest in the transaction and who are present and voting, in person, by proxy or by voting deed at the\nmeeting, and who vote against the transaction may not represent more than two percent (2%) of the voting rights of the company.\nTo the extent that any such transaction with a controlling shareholder is for a period extending beyond three years, approval is required once every three years,\nunless the audit committee determines that the duration of the transaction is reasonable given the circumstances related thereto.\nThe engagement of a controlling shareholder as an office holder or employee requires the same approvals as are described immediately above, except that the\napproval of the compensation committee, rather than the audit committee, is required.\nShareholder Duties\nPursuant to the Companies Law, a shareholder has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner toward the company and other shareholders and to\nrefrain from abusing his or her power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders and at class shareholder\nmeetings with respect to the following matters:\n• an amendment to the company’s articles of association;\n• an increase of the company’s authorized share capital;\n• a merger; or\n• the approval of related party transactions and acts of office holders that require shareholder approval.\n• In addition, a shareholder also has a general duty to refrain from discriminating against other shareholders.\n107\nIn addition, certain shareholders have a duty of fairness toward the company. These shareholders include any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who\nknows that it has the power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or a shareholder class vote and any shareholder who has the power to appoint or to\nprevent the appointment of an office holder of the company or other power towards the company. The Companies Law does not define the substance of this duty of\nfairness, except to state that the remedies generally available upon a breach of contract will also apply in the event of a breach of the duty to act with fairness.\nExculpation, Insurance and Indemnification of Directors and Officers\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may not exculpate an office holder from liability for a breach of the duty of loyalty. An Israeli company may exculpate\nan office holder in advance from liability to the company, in whole or in part, for damages caused to the company as a result of a breach of duty of care but only if\na provision authorizing such exculpation is inserted in its articles of association. Our amended articles include such a provision. The company may not exculpate in\nadvance a director from liability arising out of a prohibited dividend or distribution to shareholders.\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may indemnify an office holder in respect of the following liabilities and expenses incurred for acts performed by him or\nher as an office holder, either in advance of an event or following an event, provided its articles of association include a provision authorizing such\nindemnification:\n• financial liability incurred by or imposed on him or her in favor of another person pursuant to a judgment, including a settlement or arbitrator’s award\napproved by a court. However, if an undertaking to indemnify an office holder with respect to such liability is provided in advance, then such an\nundertaking must be limited to events which, in the opinion of the board of directors, can be foreseen based on the company’s activities when the\nundertaking to indemnify is given, and to an amount or according to criteria determined by the board of directors as reasonable under the circumstances,\nand such undertaking shall detail the above mentioned foreseen events and amount or criteria;\n• reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the office holder as a result of an investigation or proceeding instituted against him or\nher by an authority authorized to conduct such investigation or proceeding, provided that (i) no indictment was filed against such office holder as a result\nof such investigation or proceeding; and (ii) no financial liability was imposed upon him or her as a substitute for the criminal proceeding as a result of\nsuch investigation or proceeding or, if such financial liability was imposed, it was imposed with respect to an offense that does not require proof of\ncriminal intent; and\n• reasonable litigation expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the office holder or imposed by a court in proceedings instituted against him or her by\nthe company, on its behalf, or by a third party, or in connection with criminal proceedings in which the office holder was acquitted, or as a result of a\nconviction for an offense that does not require proof of criminal intent.\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may insure an office holder against the following liabilities incurred for acts performed by him or her as an office holder\nif and to the extent provided in the company’s articles of association:\n• a breach of the duty of loyalty to the company, provided that the office holder acted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would\nnot harm the company;\n• a breach of duty of care to the company or to a third party, to the extent such a breach arises out of the negligent conduct of the office holder; and\n• a financial liability imposed on the office holder in favor of a third party.\nUnder the Companies Law, a company may not indemnify, exculpate or insure an office holder against any of the following:\n108\n• a breach of fiduciary duty, except for indemnification and insurance for a breach of the duty of loyalty to the company to the extent that the office holder\nacted in good faith and had a reasonable basis to believe that the act would not prejudice the company;\n• a breach of duty of care committed intentionally or recklessly, excluding a breach arising out of the negligent conduct of the office holder;\n• an act or omission committed with intent to derive illegal personal benefit; or\n• a fine or forfeit levied against the office holder.\nUnder the Companies Law, exculpation, indemnification and insurance of office holders must be approved by our compensation committee and our board of\ndirectors and, with respect to directors or controlling shareholders, their relatives and third parties in which such controlling shareholders have a personal interest,\nalso by the shareholders. See “-Approval of Related Party Transactions Under Israeli Law—Fiduciary Duties of Directors and Executive Officers” above in this\nItem 6.C.\nOur amended articles permit us to exculpate, indemnify and insure our office holders to the fullest extent permitted or to be permitted by the Companies Law.\nWe have obtained directors and officers liability, or D&O, insurance for the benefit of our office holders and intend to continue to maintain such coverage and\npay all premiums thereunder to the fullest extent permitted by the Companies Law. Under our amended compensation policy (as approved by our shareholders at\nour 2021 annual general meeting), our D&O insurance is governed by the following guidelines:\ni. an aggregate maximum D&O insurance coverage level of $160 million comprised of up to $100 million of ABC (general) D&O insurance coverage and up\nto $60 million of Side A coverage, and\nii. the payment of premiums and deductibles under each of the Company’s D&O insurance policies (including D&O run-off and public offering insurance)\nthat are consistent with market terms, and that are not material to our company.\n. In addition, we have entered into agreements with each of our office holders undertaking to indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by Israeli law.\nDirectors’ Service Contracts\nWe are not presently party to any service contracts with any of our directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment or other service.\nD. Employees\nThe number of our full-time equivalent employees, and the distribution of employees (i) geographically and (ii) within the divisions of our company, in each\ncase as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are set forth in the two tables below.\n109\nRegion 2023 2022 2021\nAmericas* 926 1,098 1,148\nIsrael 537 531 477\nEurope 371 302 269\nAsia Pacific 146 131 145\nTotal 1,9801,980 2,062 2,039\nNumber of full-time equivalent employees\nDivision 2023 2022 2021\nOperations and support 607 620 689\nResearch and development 393 360 358\nCustomer service 281 241 264\nSales and marketing 353 495 353\nGeneral and administrative 346 346 375\nTotal 1,980 2,062 2,039\n* Includes employees in Latin America.\nDuring the years covered by the above tables, we did not employ a significant number of temporary employees.\nThe size of our workforce decreased slightly in 2023 compared to 2022. The main reason for the decrease was the divestiture of part of our SDM division. The\nnumber of our operations and support employees decreased as a result of that divestiture, whereas our research and development, and customer service staff\nincreased slightly, mainly due to the acquisition of two companies. Geographically, the distribution of our employees in 2023 continued the trend of the previous\ntwo years in partly shifting from the Americas (due to the divestiture of part of SDM) towards Israel and Europe, which increased mainly due to our acquisitions\nand due to our hiring in the United Kingdom, Italy, and towards Asia Pacific, mainly due to our acquisition of Covestro and our hiring of software personnel in\nIndia.\nThe size of our workforce did not change substantially in 2022 compared to 2021 The number of our employees in Israel and Europe grew slightly, whereas the\nnumber of employees in the Americas region (and in the United States in particular) decreased, mainly due to our divestiture of MakerBot (which was based in\nBrooklyn, New York).\nThe changes in 2022 as to the divisions in which our employees worked primarily reflect the revised categorization of some of our employees’ positions\nfollowing certain organizational restructurings, which we effected based on the recommendations of an outside consultant.\nWhile our Israeli employees, and the vast majority of all of our employees globally are not, party to a collective bargaining agreement, certain provisions of the\ncollective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including\nthe Industrialists’ Associations) are applicable to our employees in Israel by order of the Israel Ministry of Labor. These provisions primarily concern the length of\nthe workday, commuting expenses, convalescence pay, and pension fund benefits for all employees.

In order to enable our Company to continue to provide share-based long-term incentive\ncompensation after the expiration of the 2012 Plan, our compensation committee and our Board each approved our 2022 Share Incentive Plan (the “2022\nPlan”), which our shareholders approved at our annual general meeting held on September 15, 2022. Outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan will\ncontinue to be subject to the terms of the 2012 Plan, notwithstanding the expiration of that plan.\nThe following sets forth certain information with respect to our current stock option and share incentive plans. The following descriptions are only a\nsummary of each plan and each is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the respective plans, which serve as exhibits to this annual report.\nUpon the expiration of each of our stock option and share incentive plans, no further grants may be made thereunder, although any existing awards will\ncontinue in full force in accordance with the terms under which they were granted.\n2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan\nFor a description of our 2012 Plan, please see “Item 6. Directors, Senior Management & Employees—E. Share Ownership— Stock Option and Share\nIncentive Plans— 2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan” in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2021, which we filed with the\nSEC on February 24, 2022.\n2022 Share Inactive Plan\nUnder the 2022 Plan, we may grant equity-based incentive awards to attract, motivate and retain the talent for which we compete. Following the\nadoption of the 2022 Plan, we will no longer grant any awards under the 2012 Plan, though previously granted awards under the 2012 Plan will remain\noutstanding and will still be governed by the terms of the 2012 Plan.\nAuthorized Shares. Upon its effectiveness, the 2022 Plan had a total of 1,574,000 ordinary shares reserved and initially available for issuance,\nconsisting of 1,296,494 newly authorized shares and 277,506 shares that will be rolled over from the 2012 Plan, which were already approved for issuance\nby our shareholders at previous annual general meetings (which shares will be unused under the 2012 Plan as of its expiration on September 16, 2022). Out\nof that initial pool of shares, the number of ordinary shares that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section\n422 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”)) (“Incentive Stock Options”) is capped at 1,574,000.\nIn addition to the foregoing 1,574,000 ordinary shares initially available under the 2022 Plan, up to 5,432,789 ordinary shares that underlie outstanding\nawards under the 2012 Plan (and which were also already approved for issuance under the 2012 Plan by our shareholders at previous annual general\nmeetings), may, (i) if the related award expires or is canceled, terminated, forfeited, repurchased or settled in cash in lieu of issuance of shares, for any\nreason, without having been exercised, or (ii) if permitted by us, if are tendered to pay (x) the exercise price of an award or (y) withholding tax obligations,\nwill, in any such case, become available for issuance under the 2022 Plan.\nSimilarly, ordinary shares from among the initial 1,574,000 shares reserved under the 2022 Plan that become subject to an award and are ultimately not\nissued (for any of the foregoing reasons) will become available once again under the 2022 Plan.\nIn keeping with the recommendation of institutional shareholder and proxy advisory groups, the 2022 Plan does not contain an “evergreen”\nprovision that provides for an automatic annual increase in the number of ordinary shares available under the plan. Instead, we will request\nshareholder approval for any increase in the pool of shares available under the 2022 Plan.\nAdministration. A duly authorized committee of our Board (which, based on prior authorization by our Board, is our compensation committee), or, in\nthe absence of any such committee, the Board itself, will administer the 2022 Plan. Under the 2022 Plan, the administrator has the authority, subject to\napplicable law, to interpret the terms of the 2022 Plan and any award agreements or awards granted thereunder, designate recipients of awards, determine\nand amend the terms of awards and take all actions and make all other determinations necessary for the administration of the 2022 Plan.\nEligibility. The 2022 Plan provides for granting awards under various tax regimes, including, without limitation, in compliance with Section 102 of the\nIsraeli Tax Ordinance (the “Ordinance”) and Section 3(i) of the Ordinance, and, for awards granted to our United States employees or service providers,\nincluding those who are deemed to be residents of the United States for tax purposes, Section 422 of the Code and Section 409A of the Code.\nAwards. The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of share options (including Incentive Stock Options and nonqualified stock options), ordinary shares,\nrestricted shares, restricted share units and other share-based awards to employees, directors, officers, consultants, advisors and any other persons or\nentities who provides services to the company or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate thereof, subject to the terms and conditions of the 2022 Plan. Options\ngranted under the 2022 Plan to our employees who are U.S. residents may qualify as Incentive Stock Options, or may be non-qualified stock options.\nGrant and Exercise. All awards granted pursuant to the 2022 Plan will be evidenced by an award agreement in a form approved, from time to time, by\nthe administrator in its sole discretion. Unless otherwise determined by the administrator and stated in the award agreement, and subject to the conditions\nof the 2022 Plan, awards vest and become exercisable under the following schedule: 25% of the shares covered by the award, on the first anniversary of\nthe vesting commencement date determined by the administrator (and in the absence of such determination, the date on which such award was granted),\nand 6.25% of the shares covered by the award at the end of each subsequent three-month period thereafter over the course of the following three years;\nprovided that the grantee remains continuously as an employee or provides services to the Company throughout such vesting dates. The exercise period of\nan award will be ten years from the date of grant of the award, unless otherwise determined by the administrator and stated in the award agreement.\nTermination of Employment. In the event of termination of a grantee’s employment or service with the Company or any of its affiliates (including by\nreason of death, disability or retirement), different rules apply as to the length of time during which all vested and exercisable awards held by such grantee\nas of the date of termination may be exercised after such date of termination. In the case of termination due to death during employment or service for the\nCompany or any of its affiliates, or within the three month period (or such longer period of time as determined by the Board, in its discretion) after the date\nof termination, any outstanding awards shall automatically vest (to the extent not yet vested).\nAny awards which are unvested as of the date of such termination (other than in the case of death, as described above) or which are vested but not then\nexercised within the applicable period following such date, will terminate and the shares covered by such awards shall again be available for issuance\nunder the 2022 Plan.\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, if a grantee’s employment or services with us or any of our affiliates is terminated for “cause” (as defined in the\n2022 Plan), all outstanding awards held by such grantee (whether vested or unvested) will terminate on the date of such termination and the shares covered\nby such awards shall again be available for issuance under the 2022 Plan. In the case of termination for cause, any shares issued upon exercise or (if\napplicable) vesting of awards, shall be deemed to be irrevocably offered for sale to us.\nAdjustments due to Transactions. The 2022 Plan provides for appropriate adjustments to be made to the plan and to outstanding awards under the plan\nin the event of a share split, reverse share split, share dividend, distribution, recapitalization, combination, reclassification of our shares, consolidation,\nreorganization, extraordinary cash dividend or other similar occurrences.\nIn the event of a sale of all, or substantially all, of our ordinary shares or assets, a merger, consolidation amalgamation or similar transaction, or certain\nchanges in the composition of the board of directors, or liquidation or dissolution, or such other transaction or circumstances that the Board determines to\nbe a relevant transaction, then without the consent of the grantee, the administrator may make any determination as to the treatment of outstanding awards.\nAmendment and Termination. The Board may suspend, terminate, modify or amend the 2022 Plan at any time; provided that no termination or\namendment of the 2022 Plan shall affect any then outstanding award unless expressly provided by the board. Shareholder approval of any amendment to\nthe 2022 Plan will be obtained to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law. The administrator at any time and from time to time may modify or\namend any award theretofore granted under the 2022 Plan, including any award agreement, whether retroactively or prospectively.\nLimitation on Option/Other Award Repricing. Consistent with our prior undertaking under the 2012 Plan to refrain from repricing options under that\nplan (which we undertook prior to our 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders), the 2022 Plan, as well, generally does not allow us to reprice\noptions that we grant under the plan. In keeping with the recommendation of institutional shareholder and proxy advisory groups, however, the 2022\nPlan does allow us to cancel an existing award and replace it with another award (even with a lower exercise price) if the aggregate value of the new award\n(as determined under the Black-Scholes methodology or other valuation methodology chosen by the compensation committee) does not exceed that of the\naward being canceled, subject to the approval of our shareholders. That could be accomplished, for example, through the grant of a substitute award for a\nlesser number of shares with a lower exercise price. Similarly, the exercise price per share of an existing award may be reduced by the compensation\ncommittee by the amount of a dividend that we declare on our ordinary shares while the award is outstanding. That would enable a grantee to benefit from\na dividend that we declare and that all of our shareholders receive.\nBy adopting the 2022 Plan and reserving 1,296,494 newly authorized shares for issuance under it (in addition to shares being carried over from the 2012\nPlan, which were previously approved by our shareholders), we believe that we will have the flexibility to continue to provide equity incentives in amounts\ndetermined appropriate by the compensation committee, our Board, and our management, for an anticipated period of approximately one year. After that\ntime, we will request shareholder approval for further reservation of shares under the 2022 Plan. We intend to file, soon after the filing of this annual\nreport, a registration statement on Form S-8 to register the issuance of ordinary shares underlying options and RSUs granted or to be granted under the\n2022 Plan.\nEmployee Share Purchase Plan\nOur Employee Share Purchase Plan, or ESPP, was approved by our shareholders at our 2021 annual general meeting of shareholders. The purpose of the\nESPP is to enable eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to use payroll deductions to purchase our ordinary shares and thereby acquire an\nownership interest in the Company. The ESPP will be comprised of two distinct components: (1) the component intended to qualify for favorable U.S.\nfederal tax treatment under Section 423 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Section 423 Component”), and (2) the component\nnot intended to be tax qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code to facilitate participation for employees who are not eligible to benefit\nfrom favorable U.S. federal tax treatment and, to the extent applicable, to provide flexibility to comply with non-U.S. law and other considerations (the\n“Non Section 423 Component”).\nThe maximum aggregate number of ordinary shares that may be purchased initially under the ESPP will be 5,200,000 shares (the “ESPP Share Pool”),\nsubject to adjustment as provided for in the ESPP. There is furthermore no \"evergreen\" provision our ESPP.\nAdministration. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, the ESPP will be administered by the compensation committee, which will have the\nauthority to interpret and determine eligibility under the plan, prescribe forms, rules and procedures relating to the plan, and otherwise do all things\nnecessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the plan.\nShares Subject to the ESPP. As noted above, the ESPP Share Pool initially consists of 5,200,000 ordinary shares, subject to adjustment, as described\nbelow. Shares delivered upon exercise of purchase rights under the ESPP may be either shares of authorized but unissued share capital, treasury shares, or\nordinary shares acquired in an open-market transaction. In the event of certain changes in our outstanding ordinary shares, including changes by reason of\na share dividend, share split, reverse share split, split-up, recapitalization, merger, consolidation, reorganization, or other capital change, the aggregate\nnumber and type of shares available for purchase under the ESPP, the number and type of shares granted or purchasable during an offering period, and the\npurchase price per share under an outstanding purchase right shall be equitably adjusted as determined appropriate by the compensation committee.\nIf any purchase right granted under the ESPP expires or terminates for any reason without having been exercised in full or ceases for any reason to be\nexercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased ordinary shares will again be available for purchase pursuant to offerings under the ESPP.\nEligibility. Participation in the Section 423 Component may be limited in the terms of any offering to employees of the Company and any of its\ndesignated subsidiaries (a) who customarily work 20 hours or more per week, (b) whose customary employment is for more than five months per calendar\nyear, and (c) who satisfy the procedural enrollment and other requirements set forth in the ESPP. Under the Section 423 Component, designated\nsubsidiaries include any subsidiary (within the meaning of\nSection 424(f) of the Internal Revenue Code (sometimes referred to as the “Code”) of the Company that has been designated by our Board or the\ncompensation committee as eligible to participate in the plan (and if an entity does not so qualify within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code, it shall\nautomatically be deemed to be a designated subsidiary in the Non-Section 423 Component). In addition, with respect to the Non-Section 423 Component,\ndesignated subsidiaries may include any corporate or non- corporate entity in which the Company has a direct or indirect equity interest or significant\nbusiness relationship. Under the Section 423 Component, no employee may be granted a purchase right if, immediately after the purchase right is granted,\nthe employee would own (or, under applicable statutory attribution rules, would be deemed to own) shares possessing 5% or more of the total combined\nvoting power or value of all classes of shares of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. In addition, in order to facilitate participation in the ESPP, the\ncompensation committee may provide for such special terms applicable to participants who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction, or who are\nemployed by a designated subsidiary outside of the United States, as the compensation committee may consider necessary or appropriate to accommodate\ndifferences in local law, tax policy or custom. Further to that allowance, we have filed an application with the Israeli Tax Authority for favorable treatment\nunder Section 102 of the Israeli Tax Ordinance for shares purchased under the ESPP by employees who are Israeli residents. Except as permitted by\nSection 423 of the Code, with respect to the Section 423 Component, such special terms may not be more favorable than the terms of rights granted under\nthe Section 423 Component to eligible employees who are residents of the United States.\nGeneral Terms of Participation.\n• Offering Periods. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase ordinary shares during certain offering periods, which may extend to up to 27 months.\nOur Board has approved an initial offering period of six months. Each offering period may be comprised of multiple purchase periods, all as may be\ndetermined by the compensation committee. The terms and conditions applicable to each offering period shall be set forth in an “Offering Document”\nadopted by the compensation committee, containing such terms and conditions as the compensation committee deems appropriate. The provisions of\nseparate offerings or offering periods under the ESPP need not be identical.\n• Method of Participation. Shares will be purchased under the ESPP on the last day of each purchase period, each a purchase date, using accumulated\npayroll deductions, unless the compensation committee provides otherwise with respect to the employees of a designated subsidiary in a manner consistent\nwith Section 423 of the Code. In order to participate in the ESPP, an eligible employee must complete and submit to the administrator of the ESPP a\npayroll deduction and participant authorization form in accordance with procedures and prior to the deadlines prescribed by the administrator of the ESPP.\nParticipation will be effective as of the first day of an offering period.\nParticipants may elect payroll deductions of up to 15% of the participant’s total eligible earnings per payroll period within an offering period. A\nparticipant may increase or decrease the percentage of compensation designated in his or her subscription agreement, or may suspend his or her payroll\ndeductions, at any time during an offering period. However, the compensation committee may limit the number of changes a participant may make to his\nor her payroll deduction elections during each offering period (and in the absence of any specific designation by the compensation committee, a participant\nshall be allowed to decrease (but not increase) his or her payroll deduction elections one time during each offering period). A participant may withdraw all\nbut not less than all of the payroll deductions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or her rights under the ESPP at any time by\ngiving written notice to the Company in such form and timing acceptable to the Company. Upon withdrawal, any amount withheld from a participant’s\ncompensation will be returned to the participant, without interest, as soon as administratively practicable.\n• Grant and Exercise of Purchase Rights. On the first day of each offering period, each participant automatically will be granted a right to purchase ordinary\nshares on the last day of each purchase period, subject to the limitations set forth in the ESPP. On the last day of each purchase period, the payroll\ndeductions accumulated by each participant during such purchase period will be applied automatically to the purchase of ordinary shares at the purchase\nprice in effect for that purchase period. However, no participant may, on any purchase date, purchase more than such number of ordinary shares as the\ncompensation committee may prescribe. In addition, no participant will be granted a purchase right under the Section 423 Component that would permit\nthe participant’s right to purchase ordinary shares to accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 in fair market value for each calendar year, determined in\naccordance with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n• Purchase Price. The purchase price per share of our ordinary shares applicable to purchases during each purchase period under the ESPP will be eighty-\nfive percent (85%) (or such greater percentage as the compensation committee may designate) of the lower of (i) the fair market value per share of our\nordinary shares on the first day of the offering period or (ii) the fair market value per share of our ordinary shares on the last date of the purchase period.\n• Termination of Purchase Rights. Upon the termination of a participant’s employment with the Company or a designated subsidiary, or in the event the\nparticipant otherwise ceases to qualify as an eligible employee, any purchase right then held by the participant will be canceled. Payroll deductions\naccumulated by the participant during the offering period in which such purchase right terminates will be returned to the participant (or his or her\ndesignated beneficiary or legal representative), without interest, as soon as practicable thereafter, and the participant will have no further rights under the\nESPP.\n• Shareholder Rights. No participant will have any shareholder rights with respect to the ordinary shares covered by his or her purchase right until the shares\nare actually purchased on the participant’s behalf. No adjustment will be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior\nto the date of such purchase.\n• Transferability. Purchase rights granted to participants under the ESPP are not assignable or transferable, other than by will, or the applicable laws of\ndescent and distribution, and may be exercised only by the participant during his or her lifetime.\n• Amendment and Termination of the ESPP. Our Board has the right to amend the ESPP to any extent and in any manner it may deem advisable, provided\napproval of the Company’s shareholders shall be required to amend the ESPP to increase the aggregate number, or change the type, of shares that may be\nsold pursuant to rights under the ESPP (other than a permitted adjustments with respect to changes in the Company’s capitalization) or to change the\ncorporations or classes of corporations whose employees may be granted rights under the ESPP.\nOur Board also has the right at any time to terminate the ESPP. In connection with such a termination or suspension, each participant’s accumulated\npayroll deductions will be returned to the participant without interest, or the offering period may be shortened so that the purchase of shares occurs prior to\nthe termination of the ESPP.\n• Sub-Plans. The compensation committee may adopt sub-plans applicable to particular designated subsidiaries or locations, which sub-plans may be\ndesigned to be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code. The rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of the ESPP, other\nthan with respect to the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the\nprovisions of the ESPP shall govern the operation of such sub-plan.\n• Effective Date and Term. The ESPP became effective in November 2021, upon approval by our 2021 annual general meeting of shareholders. No purchase\nrights will be granted under the ESPP after the earliest to occur of the date on which all shares available for issuance under the ESPP have been issued or\nthe termination of the ESPP by our company.\n• Corporate Transactions. In the event of certain transactions or events such as a consolidation, merger or similar transaction, a sale or transfer of all or\nsubstantially all of the Company’s assets, or a dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the compensation committee may, in its discretion, provide that\neach outstanding purchase right will be assumed or substituted for a right granted by the acquirer or successor corporation or by a parent or subsidiary of\nsuch entity, will be cashed out, will be cancelled with accumulated payroll deductions returned to each participant, or that the offering period will end\nbefore the date of the proposed sale, merger or similar transaction.\n• New Plan Benefits. Benefits and purchases of ordinary shares under the ESPP depend on elections made by employees and the fair market value of our\nordinary shares on dates in the future. As a result, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by executive officers and other\nemployees in the future under the ESPP.

MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.\nA. Major Shareholders\nOwnership by Major Shareholders\nThe following table presents the beneficial ownership of our ordinary shares by each person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of 5% or more of\nour outstanding ordinary shares (to whom we refer as our major shareholders), based on the most recent beneficial ownership reports filed with the SEC by such\npersons on or before February 14, 2024. The data presented is based on information provided to us, or disclosed in public filings with the SEC, by the major\nshareholders.\nBeneficial ownership of shares is determined under rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares for which a person exercises sole or shared voting or\ninvestment power, or for which a person has or shares the right to receive the economic benefit of ownership of the shares. To the extent applicable, the table below\nalso includes as beneficially owned by any major shareholder shares underlying options, warrants or other convertible securities that are exercisable or convertible\nwithin 60 days after February 14, 2024. Shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of such convertible securities are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose\nof computing the ownership percentage of the person, entity or group holding such securities, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing\nthe ownership percentage of any other person, entity or group. The ownership percentages reflected below are based on 69,750,397 ordinary shares outstanding as\nof February 14, 2024.\nExcept where otherwise indicated, and except pursuant to community property laws, we believe, based on information furnished by such owners, that the\nbeneficial owners of the shares listed below have sole investment and voting power with respect to, and the sole right to receive the economic benefit of ownership\nof, such shares. The shareholders listed below do not have any different voting rights from any of our other shareholders. We know of no arrangements that would,\nat a subsequent date, result in a change of control of our company.\n112\nBeneficial Owner Ordinary Shares Percentage Ownership\nNano Dimension Ltd. 9,695,1151 13.9%\nRubric Capital Management LP 4,250,0002 6.1%\nNeuberger Berman Group LLC 3,877,9663 5.6%\nPhoenix Holdings Ltd. 3,640,9064 5.2%\nThe Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 3,567,7955 5.1%\nFarhad Fred Ebrahimi and Mary Wilkie Ebrahimi 3,549,9616 5.1%\n1 Represents shares beneficially owned as of December 23, 2023, as indicated in Amendment No. 12 to the statement of beneficial ownership on Schedule 13D\nfiled by Nano Dimension Ltd. with the SEC on December 26, 2023.

As indicated in that statement, Farhad Fred Ebrahimi and Mary Wilkie Ebrahimi share voting and investment power with\nrespect to all ordinary shares beneficially owned by them.\n113\nChanges in Percentage Ownership by Major Shareholders\nNano Dimension Ltd. (“Nano”) filed its initial Schedule 13G on July 18, 2022, disclosing an ownership of 8,049,186 ordinary shares, making it one of our\nmajor shareholders. Its holdings of our ordinary shares increased during 2023. As of its last amended filing on Schedule 13D, filed on December 26, 2023, Nano\nowned 9,695,115 ordinary shares, constituting approximately 13.9% of our ordinary shares, making it the largest shareholder of the Company.\nAs of the end of 2022, a new significant shareholder, Phoenix Holdings Ltd., reported that together with its subsidiaries, it had acquired a 5.9% ownership stake\nin the Company. During 2023, its percentage ownership of our ordinary shares fell to 5.2%.\nDuring 2021, the ownership of our ordinary shares by our former largest shareholder, ARK Investment Management LLC (“ARK”), decreased from 21.9% to\n11.7%. In 2022, that ownership percentage decreased to 2.6%, whereby ARK was no longer a major shareholder.\nDuring 2021, the ownership of our ordinary shares by PRIMECAP Management Company, one of our former major shareholders, decreased from 8.6% to\n5.8%. In 2022, its ownership further declined to 4.8%, whereby it was no longer a major shareholder.\nIn 2021, the ownership of our ordinary shares by Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., another one of our former major shareholders, decreased from 7.3% to\n6.9%. During 2022, its percentage ownership declined further, to 2.5%, whereby it was no longer a major shareholder.\nDuring 2023, and/or early 2024, several new major shareholders acquired ownership of over 5% of our ordinary shares, including Rubric Capital Management,\nNeuberger Berman Group LLC, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and Farhad Fred Ebrahimi and Mary Wilkie Ebrahimi.\nRecord Holders\nBased upon a review of the information provided to us by our transfer agent, as of February 14, 2024, there were 74 holders of record of our shares, of which 50\nrecord holders holding approximately 99.99% of our outstanding ordinary shares, had registered addresses in the United States. These numbers are not\nrepresentative of the number of beneficial holders of our shares nor is it representative of where such beneficial holders reside, since many of these shares were\nheld of record by brokers or other nominees. As of the said date, CEDE & Co, the nominee company of the Depository Trust Company (with a registered address\nin the United States), held of record approximately 99.6% of our outstanding ordinary shares on behalf of hundreds of firms of brokers and banks in the United\nStates, who in turn held such shares on behalf of several thousand clients and customers.\nPotential Change in Control Transactions\nDuring 2023, we were involved in, and were the subject of, potential business combination transactions that would have been potentially transformative to the\nadditive manufacturing industry. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, after none of such transactions had been completed (for various reasons), we initiated a\nwhole-scale, comprehensive analysis of our strategic options, which we have been conducting together with our advisors during the fourth quarter of 2023 and the\nfirst quarter of 2024. We provide a brief overview of the relevant strategic transactions and processes below.\nTerminated Merger Agreement with Desktop Metal\nOn May 25, 2023, we and Desktop Metal, Inc., (“Desktop Metal”), jointly announced our entry into a merger agreement, whereby our wholly-owned Delaware\nsubsidiary (“Merger Sub”) was to merge with and into Desktop Metal, with Desktop Metal surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. At the\neffective time of the merger, each share of Class A common stock of Desktop Metal issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than\nshares of Class A common stock owned or held by (a) Desktop Metal as treasury stock, (b) a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Desktop Metal or (c)\nStratasys or Merger Sub) was to be converted automatically into the right to receive 0.123 ordinary shares of Stratasys. On September 28, 2023, we\n114\nheld an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, at which, among additional proposals, the merger was presented for the approval of our shareholders. As\npart of the merger proposal, our shareholders were also asked to approve (i) the adoption of amended and restated articles of association for our company effective\nas of the time of (and contingent on the effectiveness of) the merger, which were to include, among other changes to our existing articles of association, an increase\nof our authorized share capital, and (ii) the election of a slate of directors consisting of five designees of Stratasys and five designees of Desktop Metal, as well as\nthe combined company’s chief executive officer, as the members of our board of directors effective upon the effective time of the merger.\nThe merger proposal was not approved by our shareholders at that meeting, and accordingly, pursuant to our rights under the merger agreement, we terminated\nthe merger agreement with Desktop Metal, effective immediately on September 28, 2023. As a result, we were required to, under the merger agreement, and\nactually did, pay to Desktop Metal a termination fee of $10.0 million.\nUncompleted Tender Offer, Unsuccessful Board Contest and New Proposal of Nano Dimension\nOn May 25, 2023, following the announcement of our then-prospective merger with Desktop Metal, Nano, a 14.1% shareholder of our company and a company\noperating in the 3D printing industry, launched a hostile partial tender offer whereby it sought to acquire—including shares already held by it— between 53% and\n55% of our outstanding ordinary shares, at a price of $18.00 per share. The tender offer was subject to various conditions and was originally set to expire on June\n26, 2023. Over the course of subsequent periods of time, the price offered by Nano in its tender offer was ultimately raised to $25.00 per share, with an\naccompanying reduction as to the percentage of our shares to be held by it upon consummation of the offer, to between 46% and 51%, and the offer was extended\nultimately through July 31, 2023. The offer expired on July 31, 2023 and Nano did not receive enough tendered shares and was therefore unable to complete the\npurchase of any of our ordinary shares pursuant to the offer.\nNano also requested from our company, pursuant to its rights under the Israeli Companies Law as a 5% or greater shareholder, that we convene an extraordinary\nshareholder meeting at which a vote would be held on the removal of all of our directors (except for S. Scott Crump) and their replacement with officers of Nano\nwhom it had nominated. After discussions with Nano and related court proceedings, we ultimately brought to a vote at our annual general meeting of shareholders\nheld on August 8, 2023 a contested election of directors, at which our board’s eight nominees and Nano’s seven nominees were subject to election on a nominee-\nby-nominee basis, with the eight nominees receiving more “FOR” votes than “AGAINST” votes to be deemed elected. Based on that agreed voting format, at the\nannual meeting, each of our board’s eight nominees, and none of Nano’s seven nominees, were elected. We have also been subject to litigation with Nano in an\nIsraeli district court regarding our shareholder rights plan, Nano’s uncompleted tender offer, and the above-described contested board election. The litigation has\nnot changed the outcome of any of the developments described above.\nOn December 23, 2023, while in the midst of our board-initiated process for consideration of strategic alternatives (as described under “Initiation of Strategic\nAlternatives Process” below), we received an unsolicited preliminary proposal from Nano to purchase all of our outstanding ordinary shares that it does not\ncurrently own at a price of $16.50 per share in cash. In response to that proposal, we announced on December 26, 2023 that our board would carefully review and\nconsider Nano’s unsolicited preliminary proposal as part of our strategic process.\nOffers by 3D Systems to Acquire Stratasys\nOn May 30, 2023, and then again on June 27, 2023, we received an unsolicited non-binding indicative proposal from 3D Systems Corporation (“3D Systems”)\nto merge with us. On July 13, 2023, we received an updated proposal from 3D Systems, pursuant to which it would merge with our company and pay as\nconsideration to our shareholders $7.50 in cash and 1.5444 newly issued shares of common stock of 3D Systems per Stratasys\n115\nordinary share. Our board initially determined that the 3D Systems proposal of July 13 would reasonably be expected to result in a “Superior Proposal” under our\nthen-effective merger agreement with Desktop Metal and authorized our management to enter into discussions with 3D Systems with respect to the proposal.\nFollowing an extensive due diligence process, however, we communicated our concerns regarding the 3D Systems’ proposal to 3D Systems and indicated that the\nlast proposal was not itself a transaction that we would be prepared to enter into. 3D Systems revised its proposal on September 6, 2023, offering $7.00 in cash and\n1.6387 newly issued shares of common stock of 3D Systems per Stratasys ordinary share. After consultation with our outside financial and legal advisors, our\nboard of directors unanimously determined that the September 6 proposal continued to significantly undervalue our company and did not constitute a “Superior\nProposal” pursuant to the terms of our then-effective merger agreement with Desktop Metal, and our board accordingly terminated discussions with 3D Systems.\nInitiation of Strategic Alternatives Process\nOn September 28, 2023, following the failure of the vote for approval of the merger with Desktop Metal and our consequent termination of the related merger\nagreement, we announced that we had initiated a comprehensive process to explore strategic alternatives for our company. We noted that we are no longer subject\nto restrictions under that merger agreement regarding the solicitation of or entry into potential transactions. Our board has been conducting that process together\nwith our advisors during the fourth quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024.\nB. Related Party Transactions.\nExcept as described below or elsewhere in this annual report, since January 1, 2023, we have had no transaction or loan, nor do we have any presently proposed\ntransaction or loan, involving any related party described in Item 7.B of Form 20-F promulgated by the SEC.\nIndemnification Agreements\nOur amended articles permit us to exculpate, indemnify and insure each of our directors and office holders to the fullest extent permitted by the Companies\nLaw. Effective upon the effective time of the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger, we entered into indemnification agreements with each of our then-current directors\nand other office holders, under which we undertook to indemnify them to the fullest extent permitted by Israeli law, including with respect to liabilities resulting\nfrom the merger to the extent that these liabilities are not covered by insurance. We have entered into similar indemnification agreements with all directors and\nother office holders who have served as such since the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger. We also put into place Directors and Officers liability insurance for each\nof our directors and other office holders upon the effectiveness of the Stratasys, Inc.-Objet Ltd. merger, and have renewed that policy as necessary to maintain\ncontinuous coverage since the merger.\nEmployment and Consulting Agreements with Directors and Executive Officers\nEmployment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer\nIn conjunction with his appointment as our chief executive officer, or CEO, Yoav Zeif is party to an employment agreement with us, effective as of February 18,\n2020. Under the agreement, Mr. Zeif serves as our full-time CEO for an indefinite period (subject to the termination provisions referenced further below) and\nreceives, in respect thereof, a monthly salary of NIS 175,000 (approximately $50,140, based on the current NIS-dollar exchange ratio). Mr. Zeif may be entitled to\nan annual cash bonus within a range of 50% to 150% of his annual base salary, as to be determined by our board of directors (following requisite approval from the\ncompensation committee thereof) based on achievement of company-related goals (and subject to the achievement of threshold level goals for the receipt of a\nminimum bonus).\n116\nIn addition to cash compensation, Mr. Zeif receives annual grants of RSUs. For his initial year of employment, he will receive RSUs that are equal in value to\n$800,000 (subject to a cap of 55,000 RSUs). In subsequent years, Mr. Zeif will be entitled to grants of RSUs equal in value to $1.2 million or $800,000, depending\non whether the average closing Stratasys share price for the 30-day period prior to the grant date is $20 or above, or below $20, respectively, and in the latter case,\nthe number of RSUs to be granted to Mr. Zeif will be capped at 55,000. Two-thirds of the RSUs that are granted for any such year (whether initial or subsequent)\nwill be subject to a four-year vesting schedule (commencing on the one-year anniversary of the relevant grant date, followed by 12 equal quarterly vesting periods\nthereafter). The vesting of the remaining one- third of the RSUs granted in any such year will be conditioned on the satisfaction of performance-based metrics that\nwill be determined by our board of directors and that will cover not more than four calendar years.\nBesides annual equity compensation, Mr. Zeif received, within the first 14 days of his employment, a one-time, special upside grant of options to purchase\n300,000 ordinary shares, with an exercise price that will equal the average of the Stratasys closing share price for the 30 days following his commencement of\nemployment. These special upside options will vest and become exercisable in two groups of 150,000 options each, in accordance with the schedule described in\nthe following sentence, if the average closing Stratasys share price reaches two respective levels— $10 or $20 above the 30-day average closing price prior to his\ncommencement of employment— for a consecutive six-month period following the commencement of his employment. If and when the relevant closing price\nlevel is met for the requisite consecutive six-month period, the relevant 150,000 options will vest in equal installments of 18,750 each over the next eight\nconsecutive quarters, assuming continued employment. Any options granted pursuant to the special upside grant that are not yet vested will be subject to\naccelerated vesting in the event that Mr. Zeif’s employment is terminated or he resigns for good reason in connection with, or within 12 months following, a\nchange of control transaction for which the value of our company (or our assets, if applicable) reflected in the transaction as of its closing date exceeds the\nrespective price level that initially triggers vesting.\nUnder the employment agreement, Mr. Zeif is entitled to customary additional benefits, including a pension arrangement, disability insurance and severance pay\ncontributions by us, study fund contributions by us, use of a car, annual vacation, sick leave and reimbursement for business-related, reasonably-necessary travel,\nlodging and related expenses. In the event of termination of Mr. Zeif’s employment by our company (other than for cause, or due to Mr. Zeif’s violation of his\nbelow-described undertakings) or by Mr. Zeif for good reason, Mr. Zeif will be entitled to an “adjustment” payment equal to six months’ base salary, in addition to\na three-month (in the first year of employment) or six-month (at any time thereafter) notice period (other than in a case of termination for cause, when that notice is\nnot required).\nIn connection with his execution of the employment agreement, Mr. Zeif has agreed to certain customary undertakings in favor of our company that cover\nconfidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and assignment of inventions.\nIn order to induce Mr. Zeif to accept our employment offer and in connection with his relocation from the United States to the our principal executive offices in\nIsrael related to his hiring, we paid him a signing/relocation bonus of $300,000, of which $100,000 will be repayable if his employment is terminated by us for\ncause or he resigns other than for good reason during his first 12 months of employment.\nEmployment agreement with our Chief Financial Officer\nIn conjunction with his appointment as our chief financial officer, or CFO, effective as of March 1, 2022, Eitan Zamir is party to an employment agreement with\nus. Under the agreement, Mr. Zamir serves as our full-time CFO for an indefinite period (subject to the termination provisions under the agreement). The\nagreement provides for notice periods of varying duration for termination of the agreement by us or by Mr. Zamir, during which time he will continue to receive\nbase salary and benefits (except for the accrual of vacation days). The agreement also contain customary provisions regarding non-competition, confidentiality of\ninformation and assignment of inventions. However, the enforceability of the non-competition provisions may be limited under applicable law.\n117\nBased on the approval of our compensation committee and board of directors in 2023, Mr. Zamir is entitled to certain severance benefits in the event he is\nterminated without cause, or he resigns for good reason, due to a potential change of control, or within 12 months (for purposes of unvested equity acceleration and\nleased car payments) or 24 months (for all other cash severance benefits) following an actual change in control, of our company. For purposes of his severance\nbenefits, a change of control includes, among other things: (i) the then-current directors ceasing to constitute a majority of the board where the new directors are\nnot approved by a majority of the then-current board; and (ii) a merger as a result of which pre-merger shareholders of our company own less than 55% of the\ncombined company (that threshold is reduced to 50% if our CEO immediately prior to the merger is the CEO of the combined company immediately after the\nmerger). In such a termination or resignation scenario, Mr. Zamir’s severance benefits would consist of:\n• a noncompete payment equal to 12 months of base salary;\n• release of all amounts accumulated in pension, manager’s insurance, and/or provident fund;\n• prorated annual bonus (assuming criteria achieved at 120%) for year of termination and full annual bonus for prior completed year (assuming criteria\nachieved at 100%) if not yet paid;\n• payment equal to 12 times his monthly leased car allowance; and\n• full accelerated vesting of all unvested equity awards (including performance RSUs, which would convert to ordinary RSUs based on the assumption of\nachievement of performance goals at a level equal to the greater of (i) 100% or (ii) the actual performance level, subject to the occurrence of an actual\nchange in control).\nConsistent with our current compensation policy, Mr. Zamir’s benefits due to a change in control would be capped, with respect to the aggregate value of the\nunvested equity acceleration (measured based on grant date value) and the leased car payment, to the sum of (i) $1 million, plus (ii) his full compensation for six\nmonths of employment.\nC.

Consolidated Statements and Other Financial Information.\nThe consolidated financial statements and other financial information for our company required by SEC are included in this annual report beginning on page F-\n1.\nExport Sales\nThe following table presents total export sales by Stratasys, Ltd for each of the fiscal years indicated (in thousands):\n2023 2022 2021\nTotal Export Sales* $228,941 $226,767 $211,899\nas a percentage of Total Sales 36.5% 34.8% 34.9%\n* Export sales, as presented, are defined as sales to customers located outside of North America and Israel (where our dual headquarters are located).\n118\nLegal Proceedings\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings incident to our business. Based upon the status of such cases, as determined with the advice of counsel, we have\nrecorded provisions in our financial statements for amounts (if any) judged to be both quantifiable and probable to be paid. Except as noted below, there are no\nlegal proceedings pending or threatened against us that we believe may have a significant effect on our financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nLitigation with Nano Dimension regarding Stratasys’ Rights Plan and Nano Dimension’s tender offer\nOn April 25, 2023, we were named as a defendant in an action filed by Nano in the Tel-Aviv District Court in which Nano sought declaratory relief declaring\nthat our shareholder rights plan is both illegal and void, and also requested a court order enjoining us and our directors from intervening with, or hindering in any\nway, a tender offer that Nano at the time intended to launch to acquire our ordinary shares.\nOn June 8, 2023, in our statement of defense, we rejected all of Nano’s claims, stating, among other things, that there was a substantial change of circumstance\nsince Nano’s action was filed due to Stratasys’ entry into the merger agreement with Desktop Metal on May 25, 2023 and the launch of Nano’s tender offer on May\n25, 2023. We argued that our rights plan is legal under Israeli law, and that due to the many flaws and unlawful conditions of Nano’s tender offer and Nano’s\nconduct and circumstances, our board was obligated to get involved and protect us and our shareholders. We also submitted a counterclaim to the court, seeking an\norder restraining Nano from completing its tender offer until certain conditions were to be fulfilled.\nOn July 18, 2023, in the context of an interim procedural decision, the Israeli court took the opportunity to express its preliminary view on the legality of\nshareholder rights plans for Israeli companies. The court indicated that it is inclined to view rights plans as permissible under Israeli law; that the adoption of a\nrights plan by a board should be viewed “with suspicion”; and that the board would bear the burden of proving certain matters related to the adoption of such a\nplan.\nAfter Nano’s tender offer expired on July 31, 2023, the court decided that the litigation should be put on hold. On October 10, 2023, the court issued an order\ninstructing the parties to inform the court whether they consented to the dismissal of the claim and counter-claim, with no order for costs. On November 15, 2023,\nNano informed the court that it requested to resume the proceedings. On December 19, 2023, the court issued an order noting that, from the parties’ written\nsubmissions, it was appropriate to isolate one question that requires determination: whether, under Israeli law, a company can adopt a ‘poison pill’. The court\nfurther noted that Nano should consider either amending its claim or withdrawing it and filing a new one. The court emphasized that no new evidence would be\nallowed and that should Nano choose to proceed with the current action, the only question to be considered by the court is the validity of the poison pill under\nIsraeli law. Nano is due to file its position by March 17, 2024.\nLitigation with Nano Dimension regarding Stratasys board election\nIn a separate action, on July 13, 2023, Nano filed a motion in an Israeli court requesting that the court order, among other things, that (i) we correct the agenda\nsent out to our shareholders in advance of our 2023 annual general shareholder meeting scheduled for August 8, 2023, so that the agenda would include Nano’s\nindividual director nominees for our board, and (ii) we issue a new proxy statement and proxy card for the annual general shareholder meeting.\nOn July 28, 2023, Nano issued a press release in which it announced that it intended to withdraw its nominees for the board, which Nano reiterated in a press\nrelease that it issued on August 1, 2023.\nOn September 26, 2023, at the parties’ request, the court dismissed the proceedings, without prejudice.\n119\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our ordinary shares and do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable\nfuture.\nWe intend to retain our earnings to finance the development of our business. Any future dividend policy will be determined by our board of directors based upon\nconditions then existing, including our earnings, financial condition, tax position and capital requirements, as well as such economic and other conditions as our\nboard of directors may deem relevant. Pursuant to our articles of association, dividends may be declared by our board of directors. Dividends must be paid out of\nour profits and other surplus funds, as defined in the Companies Law, as of the end of the most recent year or as accrued over a period of the most recent two years,\nwhichever amount is greater, provided that there is no reasonable concern that payment of a dividend will prevent us from satisfying our existing and foreseeable\nobligations as they become due. In addition, because we have received certain benefits under Israeli law relating to Approved Enterprises and Beneficiary\nEnterprises, our payment of dividends (out of tax- exempt income) may subject us to certain Israeli taxes to which we would not otherwise be subject. We are also\nrestricted under our credit agreement with Bank of America from paying dividends. Please see the risk factors captioned “We do not anticipate paying any cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, if our share price does not appreciate, our shareholders may not recognize a return, and could potentially suffer a\nloss, on their investment in our ordinary shares,” and “Even if we decide to pay dividends on our ordinary shares, we may be restricted from doing so or payment\nof such dividends may have adverse consequences for our company” in Item 3.D “Risk Factors-Risks related to an investment in our ordinary shares” above.\nFor a discussion of the applicable rates of withholding tax on dividends paid out of income derived from an Approved Enterprise or a Beneficiary Enterprise,\nsee “Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs - The Law for the Encouragement of Capital Investments” in Item 4.B above.\nB. Significant Changes.\nOther than as otherwise described in this annual report, no significant change has occurred in our operations since the date of our consolidated financial\nstatements included in this annual report.\nITEM 9. THE OFFER AND LISTING.\nA. Listing Details and C. Market.\nSince December 3, 2012 (the first trading day after the effective time of the Stratasys, Inc.- Objet Ltd. merger), our ordinary shares have traded (and, prior to\nthat time, Stratasys, Inc. common stock was traded) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “SSYS.”\nOur ordinary shares, par value NIS 0.01 per share, are registered on the books of our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. There are no\ntransfer restrictions apart from the requirement that any transfers comply with applicable securities laws and the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or any other\nsecurities exchange on which our ordinary shares may be listed in the future.\nITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.\nA. Share Capital.\nNot applicable\n120\nB. Articles of Association.\nThe information called for by this Item 10.B of Form 20-F has been provided in Exhibit 2.2 to this annual report. The content of Exhibit 2.2 is incorporated by\nreference herein.\nC. Material Contracts.\nWe have not entered into any material contract within the two years prior to the date of this annual report, other than contracts entered into in the ordinary\ncourse of business, or as otherwise described herein in Item 4.A-“History and Development of the Company”, Item 4.B-“Business Overview”, Item\n5.B-“Operating and Financial Review and Prospects—Liquidity and Capital Resources”, Item 6.C-“Board Practices-Director Service Contracts” and Item\n7.B-“Related Party Transactions”.\nD. Exchange Controls.\nThere are currently no Israeli currency control restrictions on payments of dividends or other distributions with respect to our ordinary shares or the proceeds\nfrom the sale of ordinary shares, except for the obligation of Israeli residents to file reports with the Bank of Israel regarding certain transactions. However,\nlegislation remains in effect pursuant to which currency controls can be imposed by administrative action at any time.\nThe ownership or voting of our ordinary shares by non-residents of Israel, except with respect to citizens of countries that are in a state of war with Israel, is not\nrestricted in any way by our memorandum of association or amended articles or by the laws of the State of Israel.\nE. Taxation.\nThe following is a short summary of certain provisions of the tax environment to which shareholders may be subject. This summary is based on the current\nprovisions of tax law. To the extent that the discussion is based on new tax legislation that has not been subject to judicial or administrative interpretation, we\ncannot assure you that the views expressed in the discussion will be accepted by the appropriate tax authorities or the courts.\nThe summary does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to all purchasers of our ordinary shares in light of each purchaser’s particular\ncircumstances and specific tax treatment. For example, the summary below does not address the tax treatment of residents of Israel and traders in securities who\nare subject to specific tax regimes. As individual circumstances may differ, holders of our ordinary shares should consult their own tax adviser as to the United\nStates, Israeli or other tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares. The following is not intended, and should not be construed,\nas legal or professional tax advice and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. Each individual should consult his or her own tax or legal adviser.\nIsraeli Taxation Considerations\nIsraeli law generally imposes a capital gains tax on the sale of any capital assets by residents of Israel, as defined for Israeli tax purposes, and on the sale of\nassets located in Israel, including shares of Israeli companies, by both residents and non-residents of Israel unless a specific exemption is available or unless a tax\ntreaty between Israel and the seller’s country of residence provides otherwise. The Tax Ordinance distinguishes between “Real Capital Gain” and “Inflationary\nSurplus”. The Inflationary Surplus is a portion of the total capital gain which is equivalent to the increase of the relevant asset’s purchase price which is attributable\nto the increase in the Israeli consumer price index or, in certain circumstances, a foreign currency exchange rate, between the date of purchase and the date of sale.\nThe Real Capital Gain is the excess of the total capital gain over the Inflationary Surplus.\n121\nIsraeli resident individuals\nCapital Gain\nAs of January 1, 2006, the tax rate applicable to Real Capital Gain derived by Israeli individuals from the sale of shares which had been purchased on or after\nJanuary 1, 2003, whether or not listed on a stock exchange, is 20%, unless such shareholder claims a deduction for interest and linkage differences expenses in\nconnection with the purchase and holding of such shares, in which case the gain will generally be taxed at a rate of 25%. Additionally, if such shareholder is\nconsidered a “Significant Shareholder” (i.e., a person who holds, directly or indirectly, alone or together with another person who collaborates with such person on\na permanent basis, 10% or more of any of the company’s “means of control” (including, among other things, the right to receive profits of the company, voting\nrights, the right to receive the company’s liquidation proceeds and the right to appoint a director)) at the time of sale or at any time during the preceding 12-month\nperiod, such gain will be taxed at the rate of 25%. Individual shareholders dealing in securities in Israel are taxed at their marginal tax rates applicable to business\nincome (up to 47% in 2023, in addition to excess tax, if any, as described below) unless the benefiting provisions of an applicable treaty applies.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Law for Change in the Tax Burden (Legislative Amendments) (Taxes), 2011, the capital gain tax rate applicable\nto individuals was raised from 20% to 25% from 2012 and onwards (or from 25% to 30% if the selling individual shareholder is a Significant Shareholder at any\ntime during the 12-month period preceding the sale and\\or claims a deduction for interest and linkage differences expenses in connection with the purchase and\nholding of such shares). With respect to assets (not shares that are listed on a stock exchange) purchased on or after January 1, 2003, the portion of the gain\ngenerated from the date of acquisition until December 31, 2011 will be subject to the previous capital gains tax rates (20% or 25%) and the portion of the gain\ngenerated from January 1, 2012 until the date of sale will be subject to the new tax rates (25% or 30%).\nDividend Income\nIsraeli residents who are individuals are generally subject to Israeli income tax for dividends paid on our ordinary shares (other than bonus shares or share\ndividends) at 25%, or 30% if the recipient of such dividend is a Significant Shareholder, at the time of distribution or at any time during the preceding 12-month\nperiod. However, dividends distributed from taxable income allocated and accrued during the benefits period of an Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise\nare subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (and 20% with respect to Preferred Enterprise, Special Preferred Enterprise, Preferred Technology Enterprise and\nSpecial Preferred Technology Enterprise), if the dividend is distributed during the tax benefits period under the Investment Law or within 12 years after such\nperiod except with respect to an FIC, in which case the 12-year limit does not apply. An average rate will be set in case the dividend is distributed from mixed\ntypes of income (regular and Approved/ Beneficiary/ Preferred income).\nIsraeli resident corporations\nCapital Gain\nUnder current Israeli tax legislation, the tax rate applicable to Real Capital Gain derived by Israeli resident corporations from the sale of shares of an Israeli\ncompany is the general corporate tax rate. As described in “Israeli Tax Considerations and Government Programs-General Corporate Tax Structure” in Item 4.B\nabove, the corporate tax rate was 24% in 2017, and is 23% since 2018.\n122\nDividend Income\nGenerally, Israeli resident corporations are exempt from Israeli corporate tax on the receipt of dividends paid on shares of Israeli resident corporations.\nHowever, dividends distributed from taxable income accrued during the benefits period of an Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise are subject to\nwithholding tax at the rate of 15%, if the dividend is distributed during the tax benefits period under the Investment Law or within 12 years after that period, except\nwith respect to a FIC, in which case the 12-year limit does not apply.\nNon-Israeli Residents\nCapital Gain\nIsraeli capital gains tax is imposed on the disposal of capital assets by a non-Israeli resident if such assets are either (i) located in Israel; (ii) shares or rights to\nshares in an Israeli resident company, or (iii) represent, directly or indirectly, rights to assets located in Israel, unless a tax treaty between Israel and the seller’s\ncountry of residence provides otherwise. As mentioned above, Real Capital Gain is generally subject to tax at the corporate tax rate (24% in 2017 and 23% since\n2018), if generated by a company, or at the rate of 25% (for any asset other than shares that are listed on a stock exchange - 20% with respect to the portion of the\ngain generated up to December 31, 2011) or 30% (for any asset other than shares that are listed on a stock exchange - 25% with respect to the portion of the gain\ngenerated up to December 31, 2011), if generated by an individual who is Significant Shareholder at the time of sale or at any time during the preceding 12-month\nperiod (or claims a deduction for interest and linkage differences expenses in connection with the purchase and holding of such shares) from the sale of assets\npurchased on or after January 1, 2003. Individual and corporate shareholders dealing in securities in Israel are taxed at the tax rates applicable to business income\n(a corporate tax rate for a corporation and a marginal tax rate of up to 50% for an individual in 2023) unless contrary provisions in a relevant tax treaty applies.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, shareholders who are non-Israeli residents (individuals and corporations) should generally exempt from Israeli capital gains tax\non any gains derived from the sale, exchange or disposition of shares publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange or on a recognized stock exchange outside of\nIsrael, provided, among other things, that (i) such gains are not generated through a permanent establishment that the non-Israeli resident maintains in Israel; (ii)\nthe shares were purchased after being listed on a recognized stock exchange and (iii) with respect to shares listed on a recognized stock exchange outside of Israel,\nsuch shareholders are not subject to the Israeli Income Tax Law (Inflationary Adjustments) 5745-1985. However, non-Israeli corporations will not be entitled to the\nforegoing exemptions if Israeli residents (a) have a controlling interest of more than 25% in such non-Israeli corporation, or (b) are the beneficiaries of or are\nentitled to 25% or more of the revenues or profits of such non-Israeli corporation, whether directly or indirectly. Such exemption is not applicable to a person\nwhose gains from selling or otherwise disposing of the shares are deemed to be business income.\nIn addition, a sale of shares may be exempt from Israeli capital gains tax under the provisions of an applicable tax treaty. For example, under the U.S.-Israel Tax\nTreaty, to which we refer as the U.S.-Israel Treaty, the sale, exchange or disposition of shares of an Israeli company by a shareholder who is a U.S. resident (for\npurposes of the U.S.- Israel Treaty) holding the shares as a capital asset is exempt from Israeli capital gains tax unless either (i) the shareholder holds, directly or\nindirectly, shares representing 10% or more of the voting rights during any part of the 12-month period preceding such sale, exchange or disposition, (ii) the\nshareholder, if an individual, has been present in Israel for a period or periods of 183 days or more in the aggregate during the applicable taxable year, (iii) the\ncapital gains arising from such sale are attributable to a permanent establishment of the shareholder which is maintained in Israel, (iv) the capital gain arising from\nsuch sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to real estate located in Israel, or (v) the capital gains arising from such sale, exchange or disposition is attributed to\nroyalties on copyright or film. In any such case, the sale, exchange or disposition of such shares would be subject to Israeli tax, to the extent applicable; however,\nunder the U.S.-Israel Treaty, a U.S. resident would be permitted to claim a credit for the Israeli tax against the U.S. federal income tax imposed with respect to the\nsale, exchange or disposition, subject to the limitations in U.S. laws applicable to foreign tax credits. The U.S.-Israel Treaty does not provide such credit against\nany U.S. state or local taxes.\n123\nIn some instances where our shareholders may be liable for Israeli tax on the sale of their Ordinary Shares, the payment of the consideration may be subject to\nthe withholding of Israeli tax at source. Shareholders may be required to demonstrate that they are exempt from tax on their capital gains in order to avoid\nwithholding at source at the time of sale. Specifically, in transactions involving a sale of all of the shares of an Israeli resident company, in the form of a merger or\notherwise, the Israel Tax Authority may require from shareholders who are not liable for Israeli tax to sign declarations in forms specified by this authority or\nobtain a specific exemption from the Israel Tax Authority to confirm their status as non-Israeli resident, and, in the absence of such declarations or exemptions,\nmay require the purchaser of the shares to withhold taxes at source.\nDividend Income\nNon-Israeli residents (whether individuals or corporations) are generally subject to Israeli income tax on the receipt of dividends paid on ordinary shares at the\nrate of 25% or 30% (if the dividend recipient is a Significant Shareholder at the time of distribution or at any time during the preceding 12-month period), 15% if\nthe dividend is distributed from income attributed to our Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise (and 20% with respect to Preferred Enterprise or 4% with\nrespect to Preferred Technology Enterprise and Special Preferred Technology Enterprise if certain conditions are met). Such dividends are generally subject to\nIsraeli withholding tax at a rate of 25% so long as the shares are registered with a nominee company (whether the recipient is a Significant Shareholder or not) and\n15% if the dividend is distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise or a Beneficiary Enterprise (and 20% if the dividend is distributed from\nincome attributed to a Preferred Enterprise or 4% with respect to Preferred Technology Enterprise and Special Preferred Technology Enterprise if certain\nconditions are met), unless a reduced rate is provided under an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax\nAuthority allowing for a reduced tax rate). For example, under the U.S.-Israel Treaty, the maximum rate of tax withheld at source in Israel on dividends paid to a\nholder of our ordinary shares who is a U.S. resident (for purposes of the U.S.-Israel Treaty) is 25%.\nHowever, generally, the maximum rate of withholding tax on dividends, not generated by our Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise, that are paid to a\nU.S. corporation holding at least 10% or more of our outstanding voting capital from the start of the tax year preceding the distribution of the dividend through\n(and including) the distribution of the dividend, is 12.5%, provided that no more than 25% of our gross income for such preceding year consists of certain types of\ndividends and interest.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, dividends distributed from income attributed to an Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise are subject to a withholding\ntax rate of 15% for such U.S. corporation shareholder, provided that the condition related to our gross income for the previous year (as set forth in the previous\nsentence) is met. The aforementioned rates will not apply if the dividend income was generated through a permanent establishment of the U.S. resident that is\nmaintained in Israel. If the dividend is attributable partly to income derived from an Approved Enterprise, a Beneficiary Enterprise or Preferred Enterprise, and\npartly to other sources of income, the withholding rate will be a blended rate reflecting the relative portions of the two types of income. U.S. residents who are\nsubject to Israeli withholding tax on a dividend may be entitled to a credit or deduction for United States federal income tax purposes in the amount of the taxes\nwithheld, subject to detailed rules contained in the Code.\nA non-Israeli resident who receives dividends from which tax was withheld is generally exempt from the obligation to file tax returns in Israel with respect to\nsuch income, provided that (i) such income was not generated from business conducted in Israel by the taxpayer, (ii) the taxpayer has no other taxable sources of\nincome in Israel with respect to which a tax return is required to be filed, and (iii) the taxpayer is not obligated to pay excess tax (as further explained below).\n124\nExcess Tax\nIndividuals who are subject to tax in Israel (whether any such individual is an Israeli resident or non-Israeli resident) are also subject to an additional tax at a\nrate of 3% on annual income exceeding NIS 721,560 for 2023, which amount is linked to the annual change in the Israeli consumer price index, including, but not\nlimited to, dividends, interest and capital gain.\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nSubject to the limitations described in the following paragraphs, the discussion below describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to a\nbeneficial owner of our ordinary shares, referred to in this discussion as a U.S. holder that is:\n• an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes;\n• a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States or under the laws of\nthe United States or of any state or the District of Columbia;\n• an estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or\n• a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more United States persons\nhave the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be\ntreated as a United States person.\nThis summary is not a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that may be relevant to each person’s decision to purchase, hold or dispose of\nordinary shares. This summary considers only U.S. holders that hold ordinary shares as capital assets.\nThis discussion is based on current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to which we refer as the Code, current and proposed Treasury\nregulations, and administrative and judicial decisions as of the date of this annual report, all of which are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. This\ndiscussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to any particular shareholder based on the shareholder’s individual\ncircumstances. In particular, this discussion does not address the potential application of the alternative minimum tax or the U.S. federal income tax consequences\nto U.S. holders that are subject to special treatment, including U.S. holders that:\n• are broker dealers or insurance companies;\n• have elected mark-to-market accounting;\n• are tax-exempt organizations;\n• are financial institutions or financial services entities;\n• are partnerships or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or partners thereof or members therein;\n• hold ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion or other integrated transaction with other investments;\n• own directly, indirectly or by attribution at least 10% of our voting power; or\n• have a functional currency that is not the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition, this discussion does not address any aspect of state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, or the possible application of the U.S. federal estate or gift tax or any\nstate inheritance, estate or gift tax.\n125\nMaterial aspects of U.S. federal income tax law relevant to a holder other than a U.S. holder, referred to in this discussion as a non-U.S. holder, are also\ndiscussed below.\nEach prospective investor is advised to consult his or her own tax adviser for the specific tax consequences to that investor of purchasing, holding or disposing\nof our ordinary shares.\nTaxation of Dividends Paid on Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under “Tax Consequences if We Are a Passive Foreign Investment Company,” a U.S. holder will be required to include in gross\nincome as ordinary income the gross amount of any distribution paid on ordinary shares, including any Israeli taxes withheld from the amount paid, on the date the\ndistribution is actually or constructively received, to the extent the distribution is paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S.\nfederal income tax purposes.” In addition, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, higher income taxpayers must pay an additional 3.8 percent tax on\nnet investment income to the extent certain threshold amounts of income are exceeded. See “Tax on Net Investment Income” in this Item below.\nDividends that are received by U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts generally will be taxed at the rate applicable to long-term capital gains (a\nmaximum rate of 15% or 20%, in case of taxpayers with annual taxable income which exceeds certain thresholds), provided those dividends meet the requirements\nof “qualified dividend income.” Dividends that fail to meet these requirements, and dividends taxable to corporate U.S. holders, are taxed at ordinary income rates.\nNo dividend received by a U.S. holder will be a qualified dividend (1) if the U.S. holder held the ordinary share with respect to which the dividend was paid for\nless than 61 days during the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60 days before the ex-dividend date with respect to the dividend, excluding for this\npurpose, under the rules of Code Section 246(c), any period during which the U.S. holder has an option to sell, is under a contractual obligation to sell, has made\nand not closed a short sale of, is the grantor of a deep-in-the-money or otherwise nonqualified option to buy, or has otherwise diminished its risk of loss by holding\nother positions with respect to, the ordinary share (or substantially identical securities); or (2) to the extent that the U.S. holder is under an obligation (pursuant to a\nshort sale or otherwise) to make related payments with respect to positions in property substantially similar or related to the ordinary share with respect to which\nthe dividend is paid. If we were to be a “passive foreign investment company” (as that term is defined in the Code) for any year, dividends paid on our ordinary\nshares in that year or in the year following that year would not be qualified dividends. In addition, a non- corporate U.S. holder will be able to take a qualified\ndividend into account in determining its deductible investment interest (which is generally limited to its net investment income) only if it elects to do so, in which\ncase the dividend will be taxed at ordinary income rates. Corporate holders will not be allowed a deduction for dividends received in respect of our ordinary shares.\nDividends on our ordinary shares will be foreign source passive income (or in some cases, general category income) for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.\nDistributions in excess of earnings and profits will be applied against and will reduce, on a share-by-share basis, the U.S. holder’s basis in the ordinary shares and,\nto the extent in excess of that basis, will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of ordinary shares.\nThe amount of a distribution paid to a U.S. holder in a foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency calculated by reference to the spot\nexchange rate on the day the U.S. holder receives the distribution. A U.S. holder that receives a foreign currency distribution and converts the foreign currency into\nU.S. dollars after receipt will have foreign exchange gain or loss based on any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the foreign currency against the U.S.\ndollar, which will generally be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.\n126\nU.S. holders will have the option of claiming the amount of any Israeli income taxes withheld at source either as a deduction from gross income or as a dollar-\nfor-dollar credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability. Individuals who do not claim itemized deductions, but instead utilize the standard deduction, may\nnot claim a deduction for the amount of the Israeli income taxes withheld, but the amount may be claimed as a credit against the individual’s U.S. federal income\ntax liability. The amount of foreign income taxes that may be claimed as a credit in any year is generally subject to complex limitations and restrictions, which\nmust be determined on an individual basis by each shareholder. Those limitations include the provisions described in the following paragraphs, as well as rules that\nlimit foreign tax credits allowable for a class of income to the U.S. federal income taxes otherwise payable on the net income in that class.\nA U.S. holder will be denied a foreign tax credit for Israeli income tax withheld from dividends received on our ordinary shares:\n• if the U.S. holder has not held the ordinary shares for at least 16 days of the 30-day period beginning on the date that is 15 days before the ex-dividend\ndate; or\n• to the extent that the U.S. holder is under an obligation to make related payments on substantially similar or related property.\nAny days during which a U.S. holder has substantially diminished its risk of loss on the ordinary shares are not counted toward meeting the 16-day holding\nperiod required by the statute. A foreign tax credit for the Israeli tax can be deferred if the U.S. holder enters into certain types of arrangements to defer inclusion of\nthe related dividend in income for tax purposes.\nTaxation of the Disposition of Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion below under “Tax Consequences if We Are a Passive Foreign Investment Company,” upon the sale, exchange or other taxable\ndisposition of our ordinary shares, a U.S. holder will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. holder’s basis in the\nordinary shares, which is usually the cost to the U.S. holder of the shares, and the amount realized on the disposition. Capital gain from the sale, exchange or other\ndisposition of ordinary shares held more than one year is long-term capital gain and is eligible for a reduced rate of taxation in the case of non-corporate taxpayers.\nGain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder on the sale, exchange or other disposition of ordinary shares generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss for\nU.S. foreign tax credit purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\nA U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting calculates the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency proceeds received on a sale as of the date on which\nthe U.S. holder receives the foreign currency. However, a U.S. holder that uses an accrual method of accounting is required to calculate the value of the proceeds of\nthe sale as of the date of sale and may therefore realize foreign currency gain or loss on a subsequent disposition of the foreign currency based on any subsequent\nappreciation or depreciation in the value of the foreign currency against the U.S. dollar. That gain or loss will generally be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.\nTax Consequences if We Are a Passive Foreign Investment Company\nWe will be a passive foreign investment company, to which we refer as a PFIC, if 75% or more of our gross income in a taxable year, including our pro rata\nshare of the gross income of any corporation in which we are considered to own 25% or more of the shares by value (subject to certain exceptions in the case of a\nU.S. corporation), is passive income. Alternatively, we will be considered to be a PFIC if at least 50% of our assets in a taxable year, ordinarily determined based\non the quarter-end average fair market value of our assets over the taxable year and including the pro rata share of the assets of any corporation in which we are\nconsidered to own 25% or more of the shares by value (subject to certain exceptions in the case of a U.S. corporation), produce or are held for the production of\npassive income.\n127\nIf we were a PFIC, and a U.S. holder did not make, as described below, a timely election either to treat us as a qualified electing fund or, if the election is\navailable, to mark our shares to market, any excess distributions we pay to a U.S. holder would be taxed in a special way. Excess distributions are amounts paid on\nshares in a PFIC in any taxable year that exceed 125% of the average distributions paid on those shares in the shorter of:\n• the three previous years; and\n• the U.S. holder’s holding period for ordinary shares before the present taxable year.\nExcess distributions must be allocated ratably to each day that a U.S. holder has held our ordinary shares. A U.S. holder would then be required to include\namounts allocated to the current taxable year and each prior year in which we were not a PFIC (but not before our first taxable year beginning after December 31,\n1986) in its gross income as ordinary income for the current year. Further, a U.S. holder would be required to pay tax on amounts allocated to each prior taxable\nyear in which we were a PFIC at the highest rate in effect for that year on ordinary income, and the tax for each such year would be subject to an interest charge at\nthe rate applicable to deficiencies for income tax.\nThe entire amount of gain that is realized or treated as realized by a U.S. holder upon the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares (generally whether or not\nthe disposition is a taxable transaction) will also be treated as an excess distribution and will be subject to tax as described in the preceding paragraph.\nIn some circumstances a U.S. holder’s tax basis in our ordinary shares that were inherited from a deceased person who was a U.S. holder would not equal the\nfair market value of those ordinary shares as of the date of the deceased person’s death but would instead be equal to the deceased’s basis, if lower.\nThe special PFIC rules described above will not apply to a U.S. holder if that U.S. holder makes an election to treat us as a qualified electing fund, to which we\nrefer as a QEF, in the first taxable year in which the U.S. holder owns ordinary shares, provided we comply with specified reporting requirements. Instead, a U.S.\nholder who has made such a QEF election is required for each taxable year in which we are a PFIC to include in income a pro rata share of our ordinary earnings as\nordinary income and a pro rata share of our net capital gain as long-term capital gain, subject to a separate election to defer payment of the related tax. If deferred,\nthe taxes will be subject to an interest charge. We would supply U.S. holders with the information needed to report income and gain under a QEF election if we\nwere classified as a PFIC.\nThe QEF election is made on a shareholder-by-shareholder basis and can be revoked only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service, to which we refer as\nthe IRS. A shareholder makes a QEF election by attaching a completed IRS Form 8621, including the PFIC annual information statement, to a timely filed U.S.\nfederal income tax return. If you are not required to file an income tax return or other return for the tax year, file the form directly with the IRS Service Center in\nOgden, UT 84201-0201. Even if a QEF election is not made, a United States person who is a shareholder in a PFIC must file every year a completed IRS Form\n8621 or other form as may be prescribed by the IRS pursuant to legislation requiring annual reports with respect to PFICs.\nA U.S. holder of PFIC shares that are publicly traded may elect to mark the stock to market annually, recognizing as ordinary income or loss each year an\namount equal to the difference as of the close of the taxable year between the fair market value of the PFIC shares and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the\nPFIC shares. Losses would be allowed only to the extent of net mark-to-market gain previously included in income by the U.S. holder under the election for prior\ntaxable years. If the mark-to-market election were made, then the rules described above (other than the rules for excess distributions, which would apply to the first\nyear the election is made if we were a PFIC in a prior year and a QEF election were not made for the first year we were a PFIC) would not apply for periods\ncovered by the election.\n128\nAlthough we do not believe that we were a PFIC in 2023, we cannot assure you that the IRS will agree with that conclusion or that we will not become a PFIC\nin 2024 or in a subsequent year. The tests for determining PFIC status are applied annually, and it is difficult to make accurate predictions of future income and\nassets, which are relevant to this determination. U.S. holders who hold ordinary shares during a period when we are a PFIC will be subject to these rules, even if\nwe cease to be a PFIC in later years, subject to specified exceptions for U.S. holders who made a QEF election in the first year they held our ordinary shares and\nwe were a PFIC or if in a later year they made any of certain elections to purge the PFIC taint of our ordinary shares, which elections generally require the payment\nof tax. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisers about the PFIC rules, including QEF and mark-to-market elections.\nTax on Net Investment Income\nA U.S. holder that is an individual or estate, or a trust that does not fall into a special class of trusts that is exempt from the tax, will be subject to a 3.8% tax on\nthe lesser of (1) the U.S. holder’s “net investment income” for the relevant taxable year and (2) the excess of the U.S. holder’s modified adjusted gross income for\nthe taxable year over a certain threshold (which in the case of individuals will be between $125,000 and $250,000, depending on the individual’s circumstances). A\nU.S. holder’s net investment income generally will include its dividends on our ordinary shares and net gains from dispositions of our ordinary shares, unless those\ndividends or gains are derived in the ordinary course of the conduct of trade or business (other than trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading\nactivities). Net investment income, however, may be reduced by deductions properly allocable to that income. A U.S. holder that is an individual, estate or trust is\nurged to consult its tax adviser regarding the applicability of the Medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in our ordinary shares.\nTax Consequences for Non-U.S. Holders of Ordinary Shares\nExcept as described in “Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” below, a non-U.S. holder of ordinary shares will not be subject to U.S. federal income\nor withholding tax on the payment of dividends on, and the proceeds from the disposition of, ordinary shares, unless:\n• the income is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the United States and, in the case of a resident of a\ncountry that has an income treaty with the United States, the income is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment, or, in the case of an individual, a\nfixed place of business in the United States;\n• the non-U.S. holder is an individual who holds the ordinary shares as a capital asset and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable\nyear of the disposition and does not qualify for an exemption; or\n• the non-U.S. holder is subject to tax under the provisions of U.S. tax law applicable to U.S. expatriates.\nA non-U.S. holder is a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares that is (1) a nonresident alien as to the United States for U.S. federal income tax purposes; (2) a\ncorporation created or organized in or under the law of a country, or any of its political subdivisions, other than the United States; or (3) an estate or trust that is not\na U.S. holder.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nU.S. holders generally are subject to information reporting requirements for dividends paid in the United States on ordinary shares. Dividends paid in the United\nStates to a U.S. holder on ordinary shares are subject to backup withholding at a rate of 28% unless the U.S. holder provides IRS Form W-9 or establishes an\nexemption. U.S. holders generally are subject to information reporting and backup withholding at a rate of 28% on proceeds paid from the disposition of ordinary\nshares unless the U.S. holder provides IRS Form W-9 or establishes an exemption.\n129\nThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, was enacted during 2014. FATCA generally requires foreign financial institutions (FFIs) to identify U.S.\naccount holders and report them to the IRS or pay a 30% withholding tax. Nonfinancial foreign entities (or NFFEs) are required to report their substantial U.S.\nowners to withholding agents or pay a 30% withholding tax. FATCA’s objective is to prevent tax evasion by requiring the disclosure of account holder information\nto the IRS. Because Stratasys is a publicly traded company that is not a financial institution, FATCA has less impact than the rules discussed above that are still in\neffect for withholding tax purposes.\nA non-U.S. holder who effects the sale of his ordinary shares by or through a U.S. office of a broker is subject to both information reporting and backup\nwithholding tax on the payment of the proceeds unless he certifies, under penalties of perjury, that he is not a U.S. person or otherwise establishes an exemption. If\na non-U.S. holder sells his ordinary shares through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to the holder outside the United States,\nthen information reporting and backup withholding generally will not apply to that payment. However, information reporting requirements, but not backup\nwithholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made to a non-U.S. holder outside the United States, if the holder sells his ordinary\nshares through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a U.S. person or has some other contacts with the United States. Those information reporting requirements will\nnot apply, however, if the broker has documentary evidence in its records that the holder is a non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met, or the holder\notherwise establishes an exemption.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against a U.S. or non-U.S. holder’s U.S.\nfederal income tax liability, and a taxpayer generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed the taxpayer’s\nU.S. federal income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the IRS, provided in each case that required information is furnished to the IRS.\nInformation Reporting by Certain U.S. Holders\nU.S. citizens and individuals taxable as resident aliens of the United States that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in a taxable\nyear in excess of certain thresholds (as determined under Treasury regulations) and that are required to file a U.S. federal income tax return generally will be\nrequired to file an information report with respect to those assets with their tax returns. IRS Form 8938 has been issued for that purpose. “Specified foreign\nfinancial assets” include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, foreign stocks held directly, and interests in foreign estates, foreign\npension plans or foreign deferred compensation plans. Under those rules, our ordinary shares, whether owned directly or through a financial institution, estate or\npension or deferred compensation plan, would be “specified foreign financial assets.” Under Treasury regulations, the reporting obligation applies to certain U.S.\nentities that hold, directly or indirectly, specified foreign financial assets. Penalties can apply if there is a failure to satisfy this reporting obligation. A U.S. holder is\nurged to consult his tax adviser regarding his reporting obligation.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents.\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts.\nNot applicable.\n130\nH. Documents on Display.\nWe are subject to the informational requirements of the Exchange Act. In accordance with these requirements, we are required to file reports and other\ninformation with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports and information statements and other information about issuers, such as us, who file\nelectronically with the SEC. The address of that website is www.sec.gov. The reports and other information filed by us with the SEC are also available at our\nwebsite, at investors.stratasys.com. The web addresses of the SEC and our company have been included as inactive textual references only. Information on those\nwebsites is not part of this annual report.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are exempt from the rules under the Exchange Act prescribing the furnishing and content of proxy statements, and our officers,\ndirectors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions contained in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In\naddition, we are not required under the Exchange Act to file periodic reports and financial statements with the SEC as frequently or as promptly as United States\ncompanies whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act.\nI.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nMarket risk is the risk of loss related to changes in market prices, including mainly interest rates and foreign exchange rates, of financial instruments that may\nadversely impact our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or cash flows.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nDue to our international operations, currency exchange rates impact our financial performance.\nThe majority of our balance sheet exposure relates to foreign currency assets and liabilities in entities which their functional currency is Euro. Our net Euro\nbalance sheet exposure as of December 31, 2023 was approximately $39.3 million.\nOur total revenues amounted to $627.6 million in 2023, of which approximately 16.3% were denominated in Euros. During 2023, our Euro-denominated\nrevenues exceeded our Euro-denominated expenses. Conversely, our expenses denominated in shekels are higher than our expected shekel-denominated revenues.\nFor those currencies which do not have a sufficient natural hedge within our operations (such as offsetting revenues and expenses recorded in a given currency, or\nsome other hedge), we may choose to hedge in order to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating results. In 2023, we entered into hedging\ntransactions to reduce our potential currency exposure related to the U.S. dollar against each of the Euro and the New Israeli Shekel. Our foreign exchange forward\ncontracts in effect as of December 31, 2023 were for the conversion of €72.0 million into USD and $46.2 million into NIS.\nThe net effect of these risks stemming from currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results can be quantified as follows:\n131\ni. A change of 10% in the value of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar in the year ended December 31, 2023 would have resulted in a change in the\nU.S. dollar reporting value of our consolidated operating income of $4.7 million for that year, mainly due to revenues earned in Euros.\nii. A change of 10% in the value of the shekel relative to the dollar in the year ended December 31, 2023 would have resulted in a change in the\ndollar-reported value of our consolidated operating income of $13.0 million, mainly due to shekel-recorded expenses.\nWe will continue to monitor exposure to currency fluctuations. Instruments that may be used to protect us against future risks may include foreign currency\nforward and swap contracts. These instruments may be used to selectively manage risks, but there can be no assurance that we will be fully protected against\nmaterial foreign currency fluctuations. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur cash and cash equivalents are held primarily in bank deposits with maturities of less than 90 days, and our short-term bank deposits have maturities of more\nthan 90 days. Both are subject to limited interest rate risk, with an average interest rate of 6.80%. A 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect\non our financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 12.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nWe carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial\nofficer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31,\n2023, the end of the period covered by this annual report. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be\ndisclosed by us in filings and submissions under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the\nSEC’s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well\ndesigned and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the\ncost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2023.\nb. Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of\nits published consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. In making our assessment, our\nmanagement used the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO). Based on such assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial\nreporting is effective based on those criteria.\nKesselman & Kesselman, an independent registered public accounting firm in Israel and a member of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited, to which\nwe refer as PwC, which audited the financial statements included in this annual report containing the disclosure required by this Item 15 has issued an attestation\nreport regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\n133\nc. Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm.\nPwC’s attestation report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is included in “Item 18-Financial Statements” on page F-1 of\nthis annual report, which attestation report is incorporated by reference in this Item 15(c).\nd. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nBased on the evaluation conducted by our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, pursuant to Rules 13a-\n15(d) and 15d-15(d) promulgated under the Exchange Act, our management (including such officers) have concluded that there were no changes in our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this\nannual report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.\nOur board of directors has determined that Mr. Yair Seroussi, who serves on the audit committee of our board of directors, meets the requirements of an “audit\ncommittee financial expert”, as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of SEC Regulation S-K and Item 16A of SEC Form 20-F and is an independent director, as defined in\nRule 5600(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS.\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which we to which we refer as the code of ethics, that applies to all directors, officers, and employees\nof our company and its subsidiaries, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller and other\npersons performing similar functions for us.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market requires companies with securities listed thereon to comply with its corporate governance standards. As a foreign private\nissuer, we are not required to comply with all of the rules that apply to listed domestic U.S. companies. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5615(a)(3), we have\nnotified Nasdaq that with respect to the corporate governance practices described below, we will instead follow Israeli law and practice and accordingly will not\nfollow the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Except for the differences described below, we do not believe there are any significant differences between our corporate\ngovernance practices and those that apply to a U.S. domestic issuer under the Nasdaq Global Select Market corporate governance rules.\n2 Audit fees consist of fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant in connection with the audit of our consolidated annual financial\nstatements and services that would normally be provided by our principal accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements.\n3 The audit-related fees for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were for due diligence related to acquisitions.\n4 Tax fees are fees for services rendered by our principal accountant in connection with tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice.\n5 All other fees are fees for other consulting services (if any) rendered by our principal accountant to us.\n135\n• Quorum for Shareholder Meetings: As permitted under the Companies Law, under a recent amendment adopted to our amended and restated articles of\nassociation, the quorum required for an ordinary meeting of shareholders consists of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or by other\nvoting instrument, who hold at least 25% of the voting power of our shares (and in an adjourned meeting, with some exceptions, two shareholders,\nregardless of the voting power associated with their shares), instead of 33 1/3% of the issued share capital required under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\n• Executive Sessions of Independent Directors: Under the Companies Law, our independent directors (as defined under the Nasdaq Listing Rules) do not\nneed to meet regularly in sessions at which only they are present, as is required of U.S. domestic issuers under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(b)(2).\n• Independent Director Oversight of Nominations: Under Israeli law, there is no requirement to have an independent nominating committee or the\nindependent directors of a company select (or recommend for selection) director nominees, as is required under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(e) for a U.S.\ndomestic issuer. Our board of directors (based on the recommendation of the executive committee thereof) handles this process, as is permitted by our\namended articles and the Companies Law. We also need not adopt a formal board resolution or charter addressing the director nominations process and\nsuch related matters as may be required under the U.S. federal securities laws, as Nasdaq requires for a U.S. issuer.\n• Compensation Committee Charter: Under Israeli law, we are not required to adopt, and our company has not adopted, a formal written compensation\ncommittee charter for the compensation committee of our board of directors, as is generally require Nasdaq Listing Rules related to the composition,\nresponsibilities and authority of the compensation committee.\n• Shareholder Approval: Pursuant to Israeli law, we seek shareholder approval for all corporate actions requiring such approval under the requirements of the\nCompanies Law, which are different from, or in addition to, the requirements for seeking shareholder approval under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635. See “Item\n6. Directors, Senior Management and Employees—C.

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk management and strategy\nWe maintain a corporate cyber risk management plan that is part of our business continuity strategy. The risk management plan has been in place for the past\nfive years, and is updated annually to align with the latest cybersecurity trends and developments. The cyber risk management plan includes annual goals and\nactivities that address relevant cyber risks that our Management Information Systems (MIS) department detects. The goals are presented and approved by our\nmanagement annually.\n136\nOur strategy for cyber risk management contains seven layers, consisting of:\n1. Firewall & Web Security\n2. Network Security\n3. Data Protection\n4. Security Visibility & Awareness\n5. Threat Intelligence\n6. End Point Security\n7. Code security\nWe maintain processes and procedures to address each layer of the strategy.\nOur ISMS (Information Security Management System) is assessed and certified annually based on industry standards and best practice.\nAs part of the onboarding of every new vendor with whom we work, we conduct supply chain, TPRM (Third Party Risks Management) processes in order to\nassess potential risks associated with such vendor, in order to ensure that the vendor meets our cybersecurity requirements.\nWe maintain an Incident Response Policy as well as an Incident Response Team (comprised as described under “Governance” below), which are based upon\nand which adhere to, respectively, global principles for detecting, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating cyber incidents. The team conducts, periodically, a\nprofessional Table Top Exercise (TTX), together with our external advisors, in which we simulate mock real-time cybersecurity incidents that relate to current\nidentified high risks.\nWe have in place corporate policies and procedures, including rules and protocols that our employees must abide by, and which reflect our approach to\ncybersecurity.\nWe work with external consultants as part of our cybersecurity risk management, but mainly for advisory purposes, such as building and executing\ncybersecurity plans and activities (for example, as advisors for our TTXs), conducting risk surveys and assessing regulatory or other legal risks. We do not,\nhowever, outsource processes or other company cybersecurity functions to third party service providers.\nWe are not aware of any previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially, or were reasonably likely to materially, affect our company (including business\nstrategy, results of operations, or financial condition). As with virtually every other public company, we believe that a potential future material cybersecurity\nincident could potentially adversely affect our business operations in a material manner, due to the reliance that we place on our Management Information Systems\nfor, among other things: effectively managing our accounting and financial functions, including maintaining our internal controls; managing our manufacturing and\nsupply chain processes; and maintaining our research and development data. The failure of our management information systems to perform properly could disrupt\nour business and product development, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess or obsolete inventory, and product shortages, causing\nour business and operating results to suffer. Please see “Item 3.D. Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and financial condition— We rely on our\nmanagement information systems…”\nGovernance\nAs part of our corporate cyber risk management plan, we prioritize the identification and management of cybersecurity risk at several levels, including board\noversight and heavy involvement of our management on an ongoing basis. Our board of directors as a whole (rather than any committee or subcommittee of the\nboard) is responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats. The board conducts an annual security board meeting, in which our chief information\nofficer (CIO) and chief information security officer (CISO) provide the\n137\nmembers of the board cybersecurity updates including risks and threats, and define relevant actions for the year to come.\nCybersecurity related activities are primarily handled at our company by an internal Management Information Systems department that is managed by an\nexperienced CIO, and which includes a CISO and a designated “Global Information Security and IT Compliance” team, comprised of security analysts and\nengineers. The team’s aspect-oriented programming (AOP) that addresses the relevant cyber risks that we detect, as well as our annual cybersecurity plan, are\npresented to, and approved by, our senior management team.\nOur CISO, who has been a chief information security officer for seven years, holds an information security certification from the “See Security Academy”, a\nleading educational institute for cybersecurity professionals, and is also a Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH) accredited by the EC-Council, widely regarded as the\nindustry’s most robust, hands-on cybersecurity program. Our CISO has 15 years of experience in Information Systems and Technology, including ten years\ndedicated to Information Security, Incident Response, Cybersecurity, and Forensics.\nThroughout the year, our management members interact in managing our cybersecurity risks, including via the following management processes:\na. The CIO reports on Management Information Systems operations including cybersecurity elements to our senior management team on a quarterly basis.\nb. The CIO updates our chief operating officer (COO) as to the status of relevant cybersecurity projects and/or incidents on a weekly basis.\nc. The CISO & CIO discuss the status of cybersecurity projects and/or incidents on a weekly basis.\nWe furthermore maintain an Incident Response Team (IRT), which is comprised of, among others, the CIO, CISO, chief legal officer (CLO) and representatives\nof the COO, the chief financial officer (CFO) and the Communications department. The IRT convenes on an as-needed basis following the suspected occurrence of\na cybersecurity incident. The IRT is accompanied by outside legal counsel(s) that are familiar with the company and its IRT and are professionally equipped to\nprovide real-time guidance and advice as may be required.\nOur Management Information Systems maintains an “Online Service Desk” through which all cyber-related issues, including potential cybersecurity incidents,\ncan be reported. Following initial review, the CIO, in consultation with our internal legal department, escalates a reported issue to the IRT, which then assembles to\naddress the incident.\nThe IRT reports to our chief executive officer and/or board of directors on case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the specific incident factors and the\ndegree of materiality of the incident.\n138\nPART III\nITEM 17.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n(COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of\nthe effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15(b).\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about\nwhether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether\ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed\nrisk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those\npolicies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the\ncompany; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect\non the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be\ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as\na whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they\nrelate.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Stratasys-Core reporting unit\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance in respect of the Stratasys-Core reporting unit is $100 million as of December 31,\n2023. Management conducts an impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be\nimpaired. Potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value is estimated by management using a\ndiscounted cash flow model. Management’s cash flow projections for the Stratasys-Core reporting unit includes significant judgments and assumptions relating to the cash flow\nprojections (including revenue growth and associated operating profits margins), the long-term growth rates, and the discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Stratasys-Core reporting unit is a critical audit\nmatter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the cash flow projections (including revenue growth and associated operating\nprofits margins), the long-term growth rates, and the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Company's\nreporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit, evaluating the\nappropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model, and evaluating the significant\nassumptions used by management, including the cash flow projections (including revenue growth and associated operating profits margins), the long-term growth rates, and the\ndiscount rate. Evaluating management's assumptions related to cash flow projections (including revenue growth and associated operating profits margins), the long-term growth\nrates, and the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting\nunit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nProfessionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and the discount rate assumption.\nPurchase Price Allocation (\"PPA\") – Covestro Acquisition\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 3, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of the additive manufacturing materials business of\nCovestro AG (\"Covestro\") for a total consideration of $61 million. This resulted in $21.9 million of intangible assets being recorded in respect of customer relationship, technology\nand trade name. Fair value is estimated by management using a multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships and a relief from royalty method for technology\nand tradename. Management’s cash flow projections for the intangible assets acquired included significant judgments and assumptions relating to revenue growth rates, customer\nattrition rates, and discount rates for customer relationships and revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for technology and tradename.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the PPA including the valuation of the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of\nCovestro is a critical audit matter are (i) there was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of intangible\nassets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate; (ii) significant audit effort was required in evaluating the significant assumptions\nrelating to the estimate, such as revenue growth rates , customer attrition rates and discount rates for customer relationships and revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount\nrates for technology and tradename; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nF-3\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets and\ncontrols over development of the assumptions related to the PPA including the valuation of the intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the\npurchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the customer relationships, technology and tradename acquired; (iii) evaluating the\nappropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods used by management; (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in\nthe multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods; and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue\ngrowth rates and discount rates for customer relationships and revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates for technology and tradename. Evaluating management’s\nassumptions related to revenue growth rates for customer relationships, technology and tradename involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the Covestro\nbusiness; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\nProfessionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and relief from royalty methods and\n(ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumption for customer relationships and the royalty rate and discount rate assumptions for technology and tradename.\nImpairment Evaluation for Equity Method Investment in Ultimaker\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company equity method investment in Ultimaker balance was $67.8 million as of December 31, 2023 after\nrecording an impairment charge of $13.9 million. The carrying value of this equity method investment is evaluated for impairment when indicators of a loss in value below the\ncarrying value exist, including, a lack of sustained earnings or a deterioration of market conditions, among others. The Company records an impairment charge, when the\ndetermined fair value is lower than carrying value, and such reduction in fair value is considered other-than-temporary. .Fair value is estimated by management using a discounted\ncash flow model. Management’s cash flow projections for the equity investment includes significant judgments and assumptions relating to the cash flow projections (including\nrevenue growth and associated operating profits margins), the long-term growth rates, and the discount rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessment of the equity method investment is a critical audit matter are\n(i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the equity method investment; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and\neffort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the cash flow projections (including revenue growth and associated operating\nprofits margins), the long-term growth rates, and the discount rate; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the equity method\ninvestment. These procedures also included, among others, testing management's process for developing the fair value estimate of the equity method investment, evaluating the\nappropriateness of the discounted cash flow model, testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the model, and evaluating the significant\nassumptions used by management, including the cash flow projections (including revenue growth and associated operating profits margins), the long-term growth rates, and the\ndiscount rate. Evaluating management's assumptions related to cash flow projections (including revenue growth and associated operating profits margins), the long-term growth\nrates, and the discount rate involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the equity\nmethod investment, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the\naudit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow model and the discount rate assumption.\n/s/ Kesselman &

Stratasys’ products and comprehensive solutions improve product quality, development time, cost, time-to-market and patient care. The Company’s 3D\necosystem of solutions and expertise includes 3D printers, materials, software, expert services, and on-demand parts production.\nThe Company has one operating segment, which generates revenues via the sale of its 3D printing systems, related services and consumables and by providing\nadditive manufacturing (“AM”) solutions. The Company operates mainly through offices in Israel, the United States, Germany, Hong Kong and Japan.\nIn October 2023, Israel was attacked by a terrorist organization and entered a state of war. As of the date of these financial statements, the war in Israel is ongoing\nand continues to evolve. One of the Company’s global headquarters and one of its manufacturing facilities are located in Israel. As of the filing date of these\nfinancial statements, the Company's activities in Israel remain largely unaffected by the war. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the impact of the war on\nthe Company’s results of operations and financial condition is limited, but such impact may change, and could be significant, as a result of the continuation,\nescalation or expansion of the war. The Company continues to maintain business continuity plans backed by its inventory levels located outside of Israel.\nb. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Stratasys Ltd., and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions,\nincluding profits from intercompany sales not yet realized outside the Company, have been eliminated in consolidation.\nF-9\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFunctional Currency and Foreign Currency Transactions\nA major part of the Company’s operations is carried out by Stratasys Ltd. in Israel and its subsidiaries in the United States. The functional currency of these\nentities is the U.S. dollar (“dollar” or “$”). The functional currency of other subsidiaries is generally their local currency. The financial statements of those\nsubsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements, based on translation into U.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities accounts are translated at year-end\nexchange rates, while revenues and expenses accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The remeasurement adjustments of foreign\ncurrencies translation are included in the Company’s shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency remeasurements of monetary balances denominated in non-functional currencies\nare reflected in financial income (expenses), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates using assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. As\napplicable to these consolidated financial statements, the most significant estimates relate to recoverability of intangibles and goodwill and purchase price\nallocation including contingent consideration.\nIn particular, a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the war in Israel and other global events and other longer-term macroeconomic\nconditions, most prominently, the extent and speed at which inflation subsides, whether and when interest rate cuts are implemented by central banks, whether tight\ncredit markets are loosened, and whether capital markets and global supply chains fully recover. As a result, the accounting estimates and assumptions may change\nover time. Such changes could have an additional impact on the Company’s long-lived asset and intangible asset valuation; and the allowance for expected credit\nlosses. These consolidated financial statements reflect the financial statement effects based upon management’s estimates and assumptions utilizing the most\ncurrently available information.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. A hierarchy has been established for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of\nunobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.\nObservable inputs are inputs that are developed using market data, such as publicly available information about actual events or transactions, and that reflect the\nassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs for which market data are not available and that\nare developed using the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The fair value\nhierarchy categorizes into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can\naccess at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs include inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either\ndirectly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest\npriority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair\nvalue measurement.\nF-10\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company allocates the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling\ninterests in the acquired business based on their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately\nfrom the business combination and are expensed as incurred. The excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling\ninterest in the acquiree over the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed in the acquired business is recorded as goodwill. Fair value estimates are based\non the assumptions management believes a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value of the consideration transferred may include\na combination of cash, equity securities, earn out payments and deferred payments. The allocation of the consideration transferred in certain cases may be subject\nto revision based on the final determination of fair values during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date. The cumulative\nimpact of revisions during the measurement period is recognized in the reporting period in which the revisions are identified. The Company includes the results of\noperations of the businesses that it has acquired in its consolidated results prospectively from the respective dates of acquisition. When the Company acquires net\nassets that do not constitute a business, as defined under U.S. GAAP, no goodwill is recognized and acquired IPR&D is expensed unless it has an alternative future\nuse.\nThe Company records obligations in connection with its business combinations at fair value on the acquisition date. Key assumptions used to determine the\nestimated fair value of the contingent consideration amounts include: (a) internal cash flows forecasts for the relevant period during which the financial metrics\nshould be achieved; and (b) a discount rate which reflects the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the operations and the\nuncertainty inherent in the Company's internally developed forecasts. Each reporting period thereafter, the Company revalues earn-out payments and deferred\npayments which are classified as liabilities and records the changes in their fair value in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss under\nselling, general and administrative expenses.\nChanges in the fair value of the obligations in connection with its business combinations can result from adjustments to the discount rates, the Company’s\nshares price, sales and profitability targets. These fair value measurements represent Level 3 measurements, as they are based on significant inputs not observable\nin the market. Significant judgment is required in determining the assumptions utilized as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent measurement period.\nAccordingly, changes in the assumptions described above could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments, which include short-term bank deposits that are not restricted as to withdrawal or use, with maturities of ninety days or less when\nacquired, are considered to be cash equivalents.\nBank Deposits\nBank deposits with original maturity dates of more than three months but at balance sheet date are less than one year are included in short-term bank deposits.\nThe fair value of bank deposits approximates the carrying value since they bear interest at rates close to the prevailing market rates.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nThe Company maintains the allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Company’s customers to make required payments. The allowance\nrepresents the current estimate of lifetime expected credit losses over the remaining duration of existing accounts receivable considering current market conditions\nand supportable forecasts when appropriate. The estimate is a result of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of collectability, customer creditworthiness, historical\nlevels of credit losses, and future expectations.\nF-11\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAllowance for credit losses due to the Company’s accounts receivable amounted to $1.4 million and $0.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses. Accounts receivable are written-off against\nthe allowance for credit losses when management deems the accounts are no longer collectible.\nThe balance and the changes in the allowance for expected credit losses are comprised as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of year $ 860 $ 517 $ 870\nChange during the year, net 725 420 50\nBad debt written off (136) (77) (403)\nBalance at end of year $ 1,449 $ 860 $ 517\nDerivative Instruments and Hedge Accounting\nThe Company conducts its operations globally and may be exposed to global market risks and to the risk that its earnings, cash flows and equity could be\nadversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. As part of the Company’s risk management strategy, the Company enters into transactions\ninvolving foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments. For its non-hedging transactions, the Company manages its foreign currency exposures on a\nconsolidated basis, which allows the Company to net exposures and take advantage of any natural hedging. The transactions are designed to manage the\nCompany’s net exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. Financial markets and currency volatility may limit the Company’s ability to hedge these exposures. The Company does not enter into derivative\ntransactions for trading purposes.\nThe Company recognizes these derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. Derivatives in a gain\nposition are reported in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets and derivatives in a loss position are recorded in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, on a gross basis.\nWhen the Company enters into a derivative contract, it designates the derivative for accounting purposes, as either a hedging instrument which qualifies for\nhedge accounting or as a non-hedging instrument which does not qualify for hedge accounting. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company formally\ndocuments at the inception of each hedging relationship the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each\nhedging relationship, and the method used to assess hedge effectiveness.\nFor each hedging instrument that hedges the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows and that is designated and effective as a cash flow hedge, the\nunrealized gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Company’s shareholders’ equity\nand is reclassified into earnings in the same period and in the same line item in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The cash flows associated with these\nderivatives are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows consistently with the classification of cash flows from the underlying hedged items that these\nderivatives are hedging.\nFor non-hedging instruments, the Company records the changes in fair value of derivative instruments in financial income (expenses), net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and comprehensive loss. The cash flows associated with these derivatives are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the Company’s derivative and hedging activities.\nF-12\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined mainly using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in,\nfirst-out basis. Inventory costs consist of materials, direct labor and overhead. Net realizable value is determined based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary\ncourse of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The Company periodically assesses inventory for obsolescence\nand excess balances and reduces the carrying value by an amount equal to the difference between its cost and the net realizable value. The net realizable value is\nprimarily estimated based on future demand forecasts, as well as, historical sales trends, product life cycle status and product development plans.\nEquity method investments\nThe Company’s investments in non-marketable equity securities in which it has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not control through\nvariable interests or voting interests, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the Company recognizes its proportionate\nshare of the comprehensive income or loss of the investee. The Company’s share of profit or losses from equity method investments is included in share in net\nprofits (losses) of associated companies.\nThe Company periodically reviews equity method investments for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of such investments may not be recoverable. The Company will record an impairment charge to the extent that the estimated fair value of an investment is\nless than its carrying value and the Company determines the impairment is other-than-temporary. Impairment charges, if applicable, are recorded in \"Share in net\nprofits (losses) of associated companies\".\nOther Long-term Investments\nOther non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair value in which the Company does not have a controlling interest or significant\ninfluence are accounted for under the measurement alternative method. Under this method, the investments are carried at their original cost, less any impairment\nand adjusted for observable price changes for identical or similar instruments. Marketable securities are carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nInvestments in convertible notes are carried at fair value utilizing a combination of discounted cash flows associated with the note and the fair value of the\nequity into which the note may be converted. This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs in the market and thus represents a Level 3\nmeasurement within the fair value hierarchy. Refer to note 5.\nThe Company reviews its other long-term investments for potential impairment or other adjustments, which generally involves an analysis of the facts and\nchanges in circumstances influencing the investments.\nAs of December 31, 2023 the amount presented under Long-term investments included investment in equity method investment in the amount of $67.8 million. see\nalso Note 2. The balance of long-term investments represents investments in non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair value and\nconvertible notes.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the shorter of the lease term (including any renewal periods, if appropriate) or the estimated\nuseful life of the asset.\nRepairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred, while betterments and improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality of property,\nplant and equipment are capitalized.\nDepreciation is computed primarily over the following periods:\nF-13\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUseful Life\nin Years\nBuildings 25 - 40\nMachinery and equipment 5 - 10\nLeasehold and buildings improvements 5 - 10\nComputer equipment and software 3 - 5\nOffice equipment, furniture and fixtures 5 - 14\nThe Company reviews the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, the Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the\nidentifiable cash flows relating to the group are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The Company then compares the carrying\namounts of the assets or asset groups with the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows. In the event impairment exists, an impairment charge is recorded at\nthe amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. In addition, the remaining depreciation period for the impaired asset\nwould be reassessed and, if necessary, revised.\nOther Intangible Assets, net\nIntangible assets and their useful lives are as follows:\nUseful Life\nin Years\nDeveloped technology 5 - 10\nPatents\n10\nTrade names 5 - 9\nCustomer relationships 5 - 10\nDefinite life intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of useful life. Amortization of acquired developed\ntechnology is recorded in cost of revenues. Amortization of trade names, customer relationships and patents is recorded under selling, general and administrative\nexpenses.\nFor definite life intangible assets, the Company reviews the carrying amounts for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In evaluating recoverability, the Company groups assets and liabilities at the lowest level such that the\nidentifiable cash flows relating to the group are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The Company then compares the carrying\namounts of the asset or assets groups with their respective estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the definite life intangible asset or assets group are\ndetermined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded at the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or assets group exceeds their fair value. Fair\nvalue is determined by using an applicable discounted cash flow model. In addition, the remaining amortization period for the impaired asset would be reassessed\nand, if necessary, revised. Refer to Note 9 for further information.\nF-14\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill\nGoodwill reflects the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the business combination date\nover the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a\nbusiness combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. The Company allocates goodwill to its reporting units based on the reporting\nunit expected to benefit from the business combination.\nThe primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired companies and the Company and the acquired assembled\nworkforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset.\nGoodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level, or whenever events or circumstances\npresent an indication of potential impairment which requires an interim goodwill impairment analysis.\nASC 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and other” (“ASC 350”), allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the\ntwo-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment does not result in a more likely than not indication of impairment, no further\nimpairment testing is required. If it does result in a more likely than not indication of impairment, the quantitative goodwill impairment test two-step impairment\ntest is performed. Alternatively, ASC 350 permits an entity to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the\nquantitative first step of the goodwill impairment test. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the\namount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be greater than its carrying\namount, the applicable goodwill is not impaired.\nRetirement Plans and Employee Rights Upon Termination\nUnder Israeli law, the Company is required to pay a severance payment to its employees in Israel upon dismissal of an employee or upon termination of\nemployment in certain other circumstances. The Company makes ongoing deposits into its Israeli employee pension plans to fund their severance liabilities. For its\nemployees who are employed under the Section 14 of the Severance Pay Law, 1963 (”Section 14”), the Company makes deposits with certain insurance companies\nfor accounts controlled by each applicable employee in order to secure the employee’s rights upon termination. In addition, the related obligations and amounts\ndeposited on behalf of the applicable employees for such obligations are not presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, as the amounts funded are\nnot under the control and management of the Company and the Company is legally released from the obligation to pay any severance payments to the employees\nonce the required deposit amounts have been paid.\nSeverance pay liabilities with respect to the Company’s employees in Israel who are not subject to Section 14, as well as employees who have special\ncontractual arrangements, are provided for in the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on the length of time that they work for the Israeli entity and\ntheir latest monthly salary. The Company’s liabilities for those Israeli employees, in amounts of $2.5 million and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, are presented as other non-current liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. These liabilities are recorded as if they were payable at\neach balance sheet date. These liabilities are partially funded by the purchase of insurance policies or by the establishment of pension funds with dedicated deposits\nin the funds. The amounts used to fund these liabilities are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets under other non-current assets. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $2.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, deposited in these insurance policies and pension funds. These policies\nare the Company’s assets. However, under employment agreements and subject to certain limitations, any policy may be transferred to the ownership of the\nindividual employee for whose benefit the funds were deposited.\nIn addition, the Company has liabilities for severance payments to its employees in other jurisdictions in accordance with local laws and practices of the\ncountries in which they are employed.\nF-15\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSeverance expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $4.3 million, $3.9 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\nFor its employees in the United States, the Company has a defined contribution retirement plan (the “Plan”) under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) that covers eligible U.S. employees as defined in the Plan. Participants may elect to contribute both pre-\ntax or after-tax (“Roth”) up to 50% of annual taxable compensation, as defined by the Plan, up to a maximum amount prescribed by the Code. The Company, at its\ndiscretion, makes matching contributions equal to 4% of the participant’s annual compensation. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the\nCompany made 401(k) Plan contributions of approximately $3.1 million, $3.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively.\nContingent Liabilities\nThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The outcomes of the legal proceedings that\nare pending as of the date the financial statements are issued are subject to significant uncertainty. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that\nare pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal\nproceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought. Such assessment inherently involves an\nexercise of judgment. If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that loss would be incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably\nestimated, then the Company would record an accrual in the Company’s financial statements based on its best estimate. Loss contingencies considered to be remote\nby management are generally not disclosed unless material. The respective legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives revenues from sales of additive manufacturing systems, consumables and services. The Company sells its products directly through its\nsales force, independent sales agents and indirectly through authorized resellers.\nThe Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:\n• Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer\n• Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\n• Determination of the transaction price\n• Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\n• Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or providing services to the end customer or to\nthe reseller.\nThe amount of consideration is usually at fixed price at the contract inception. Consideration from shipping and handling are recorded on a gross basis within\nproduct revenue. Revenues are recorded net of any taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and value-added taxes.\nRevenue from products, which consist of systems and consumables, is recognized when the customer has obtained control of the goods, generally at a point in\ntime upon shipment or once delivery and risk of loss has transferred to the customer. The Company recognizes revenue on sales to resellers when the reseller has\neconomic substance apart from the Company and the reseller is considered the principal for the transaction with the end-user customer. Service revenue derives\nfrom service type warranty and from the Company’s direct manufacturing parts services. Revenue from service is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over\nthe time of the service, as control is transferred over time or as services are performed if not under contract.\nF-16\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company enters into contracts with customers that can include various combinations of products and services which are generally distinct and accounted\nfor as separate performance obligations. Products or services that are promised to a customer can be considered distinct if both of the following criteria are met: (i)\nthe customer can benefit from the products or services either on its own or together with other readily available resources, and (ii) the Company’s promise to\ntransfer the products or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nThe transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) basis and revenue is recognized for\neach performance obligation when control has passed. In most cases, the Company is able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of services sold\nseparately in comparable circumstances to similar customers and for products based on the Company’s best estimates of the price at which the Company would\nhave sold the product regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company reassesses the SSP on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change.\nIn assessing collectability as part of the revenue recognition process, the Company considers a number of factors in the evaluation of the creditworthiness of the\ncustomer, including past due amounts, payment history and financial condition. In some cases where collectability is not assured, payment terms are set partially or\nentirely as prepayment or customers may be required to furnish letters of credit.\nSee Note 4 for additional information related to disaggregation of revenue and other.\nShipping and handling costs\nShipping and handling costs are classified as cost of revenues.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and were approximately $4.2 million, $5.1 million and $4.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of employee compensation expenses, materials, laboratory supplies, costs for related software and costs for\nfacilities and equipment. Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. Government reimbursements and other participations for\ndevelopment of approved projects are recognized as a reduction of expenses as the related costs are incurred. The Company is not required to pay royalties on sales\nof products developed using its government funding.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Company’s provision for income taxes is based on\nincome tax rates in the tax jurisdictions where it operates, permanent differences between financial reporting and tax reporting, and available credits and incentives.\nDeferred taxes are determined utilizing the “asset and liability” method based on the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying\namount and tax bases of assets and liabilities under the applicable tax laws, and on enacted tax rates in effect when the deferred taxes are expected to be settled or\nrealized. Deferred taxes for each jurisdiction are presented as a non-current net asset or liability, net of any valuation allowances.\nDeferred taxes have not been provided on the following items:\nF-17\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Taxes that would apply in the event of disposal of investments in first-tier foreign subsidiaries, as it is generally the Company’s intention to hold these\ninvestments, not to realize them.\n2. Dividends distributable from the income of foreign companies as the Company does not expect these companies to distribute dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture. If these dividends were to be paid, the Company would have to pay additional taxes at a rate of up to 25% on the distribution, and the amount\nwould be recorded as an income tax expense in the period the dividend is declared.\nAmounts of tax-exempt income generated from the Company’s prior Approved Enterprises (see note 10c), as the Company intends to permanently reinvest\nthese profits and does not intend to distribute dividends from such income. If these dividends were to be paid, the Company would have to pay additional taxes at a\nrate up to 10% on the distribution, and the amount would be recorded as an income tax expense in the period the dividend is declared.\nValuation Allowances\nValuation allowances are provided unless it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized. In the determination of the appropriate valuation\nallowances, the Company considers future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, the most recent projections of future business results, prior earnings\nhistory, carryback and carry forward and prudent tax strategies that may enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. Assessments for the\nrealization of deferred tax assets made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are significantly\nhigher or lower than expected, or if the Company takes operational or tax positions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company takes a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by\ndetermining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the position will be\nsustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any.\nThe second step is performed only if the tax position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and is to measure the tax benefit as the amount which\nis more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these tax positions quarterly and makes adjustments as required. The\nliabilities relating to uncertain tax positions are classified as non-current in the consolidated balance sheets unless the Company anticipates making payments\nwithin one year. The Company classifies interest and penalties recognized in the financial statements relating to uncertain tax positions under the provision for\nincome taxes.\nThe Company presents unrecognized tax benefits as a reduction to deferred tax asset where a net operating loss, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward\nthat are available, under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction, to offset any additional income taxes that would result from the settlement of a tax position.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for its equity classified stock-based awards, including stock-based option awards, restricted\nstock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”) under the Stratasys Ltd. 2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) and the Stratasys Ltd.\n2022 Share Incentive Plan (the “2022 Plan”) based on estimated fair values on the grant date.\nF-18\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company calculates the fair value of stock-based option awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The option-pricing\nmodel requires a number of assumptions, of which the most significant are the expected share price volatility and the expected option term. The computation of\nexpected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company’s shares. The expected option term is calculated using the simplified method, as the Company\nconcludes that its historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis to estimate its expected option term. The interest rate for periods\nwithin the expected term of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The Company’s expected dividend rate is zero since\nthe Company does not currently pay cash dividends on its shares and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.\nEach of the above factors requires the Company to use judgment and make estimates in determining the percentages and time periods used for the calculation. If\nthe Company were to use different percentages or time periods, the fair value of stock-based option awards could be different. The fair values of the Company’s\nRSUs and PSUs are measured based on the fair value of the Company’s ordinary shares on the date of grant. The fair value of shares to be issued under the\nemployee stock purchase plan (\"ESPP\") are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation model.\nThe Company recognizes compensation expenses for its stock-based option awards (including awards under its ESPP program) and RSUs on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period (primarily six-month period for the ESPP and a four-year period for the rest of the awards). The Company accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur. The Company recognizes compensation expenses for its PSUs based on the probability that the performance metrics will be achieved\nover the vesting period. At each reporting period the Company evaluates the probability that its PSUs will be earned and adjust its previously recognized\ncompensation expense as necessary. If the achievement of the respective performance metrics is not probable or the respective performance are not met the\nCompany reverses its previously recognized compensation expense.\nRestructuring Plan\nThe Company may incur restructuring charges in connection with certain initiatives designed to adjust the Company’s cost and operating structure, improve\nefficiencies across the Company and to better align with the Company’s long-term strategy and overall market conditions. Restructuring charges include employee\nseverance and associated termination costs related to the reduction of workforce, costs related to facilities closures, impairment charges of the respective long-lived\nassets and contract termination costs. Restructuring charges for employees’ termination costs are recognized when the required actions to execute the restructuring\ninitiative were performed and the initiatives are probable and costs are estimable. Restructuring charges for facilities and contract terminations are recognized\nwhen the Company ceased using the rights conveyed by the contract. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in estimating the impact of restructuring\nplans on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nLoss per Share\nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders of Stratasys Ltd. by the weighted average number of\nordinary shares (including fully vested RSUs, PSUs and ordinary shares purchased under the Company’s employee share purchase plan (the “ESPP”)) outstanding\nfor the reporting periods.\nThe denominator for diluted net loss per share is a computation of the weighted-average number of ordinary shares and the potential dilutive ordinary shares\noutstanding during the period. Potential dilutive shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of in-the-money options, ESPP and unvested RSUs using the treasury\nstock method. PSUs are considered contingently issuable shares for diluted net loss per share purposes and the dilutive impact, if any, is included in the weighted\naverage shares as of the beginning of the period in which the performance conditions were satisfied.\nF-19\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, short term bank\ndeposits, accounts receivables, and foreign currency exchange forward contracts. Most of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits are invested\nin U.S. dollar instruments with major banks in the U.S., Israel and Europe. Management believes that the credit risk with respect to the financial institutions that\nhold the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits is low.\nConcentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited due to the relatively large number of customers and their wide geographic distribution.\nIn addition, the Company seeks to mitigate its credit exposures to its accounts receivable by credit limits, credit insurance, ongoing credit evaluation and account\nmonitoring procedures.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease classification is governed by five criteria in ASC 842-10-25-2. If any of these five\ncriteria is met, the Company classifies the lease as a finance lease; otherwise, the Company classifies the lease as an operating lease. When determining lease\nclassification, the Company’s approach in assessing two of the mentioned criteria is: (i) generally 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying\nasset is a major part of the remaining economic life of that underlying asset; and (ii) generally 90% or more of the fair value of the underlying asset comprises\nsubstantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset.\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU assets represent Stratasys's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease\nterm. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of the lease\npayments.\nThe standard also provides practical expedients for an entity’s ongoing accounting. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all\nleases with a term shorter than 12 months. This means that for those leases, the Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities, including not\nrecognizing ROU assets or lease liabilities for existing short-term leases of those assets in transition, but recognizes lease expenses over the lease term on a\nstraight-line basis. The Company also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of the Company leases.\nLease terms will include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Stratasys will exercise or not exercise the option to renew or\nterminate the lease.\nThe Company is a party to several lease agreements for its facilities, the latest of which has been extended until June 2032. The Company has the option to\nextend certain agreements for additional periods, the earliest of which is until the start of February 2024 and the latest is until the end of June 2037. During the\nextended lease period, the aggregate annual rental payments will increase by 2% to 4% each year.\nThe Company also leases vehicles for its employees with different commencement and ending periods in Israel and Germany solely. The latest lease agreement\nis until the start of July 2026.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2023\nF-20\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2021-08 “Business Combinations\n(Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities\nacquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\n(“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The guidance will result in the acquirer recognizing contract assets and contract liabilities at the same\namounts recorded by the acquiree. The guidance should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date. The guidance is effective\nfor fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance effective January 1,\n2023, with no material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements, not yet adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. This guidance is intended to\nenhance the transparency and decision-usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 address investor requests for enhanced income tax\ninformation primarily through changes to disclosure regarding rate reconciliation and income taxes paid both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09\nis effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis, with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is\npermitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”. This guidance expands public\nentities’ segment disclosures primarily by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker\nand included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures\nof a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the\ndisclosures required under ASC 280. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments are required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in an\nentity’s financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact it may have on its consolidated financial statements\nrelated disclosures.\nNote 2. Certain Transactions\nMakerBot and Ultimaker transaction (\"Ultimaker\")\nOn August 31, 2022, Stratasys completed the merger of MakerBot (previously, a fully owned subsidiary) with Ultimaker, which together formed a new entity\nunder the name Ultimaker. The Company recorded a net gain of $39.1 million from deconsolidation of MakerBot, representing the difference between the book\nvalue of MakerBot's net assets and the fair value allocated to such net assets in the transaction as follows:\n(U.S. $ in thousands)\nFair value, net $ 55,751\nNet assets deconsolidated (14,146)\nTransaction expenses (2,469)\nGain from deconsolidation of subsidiary $ 39,136\nF-21\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company accounts for its investment in the combined company Ultimaker according to the equity method in accordance with ASC Topic 323, as it has\nretained the ability to exercise significant influence but does not control the new entity. The Company recognized an equity method investment in a total amount of\n$105.6 million comprised of the assumed fair value of the MakerBot shares and additional amount invested in cash by the Company, representing a share of 46.5%\nin the new entity.\nThe allocation of the purchase price (“PPA”) to the underlying net assets acquired and liability assumed resulted in the recognition of intangible assets with a\nvalue of $27.4 million, goodwill of $49.3 million and other net assets of $28.7 million. The value assigned to intangible assets is amortized over a period of 4 to 13\nyears and the related amortization is included under share in net losses (profits) from associated companies. The estimated fair values are based on the information\nthat was available as of August 31, 2022.\nDuring 2023, Ultimaker encountered difficulties in its business partially as a result of tighter competition and global market conditions. As a result, senior\nmanagement at Ultimaker was replaced and the new management implemented a restructuring plan and additional steps to reduce cost and improve profitability.\nThe Company considered such events as indicators of potential impairment and accordingly performed an impairment analysis for the investment in Ultimaker.\nBased on such valuation, the fair value of the investment was estimated below its carrying amount and such reduction in fair value was determined to be other than\ntemporary. Accordingly the Company recorded an impairment charge at the amount of $13.9 million, which was recorded in share in losses of associated\ncompanies in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Management’s cash flow projections for the fair value of the investment in\nUltimaker includes significant judgments and assumptions relating to the cash flow projections, future growth and future profitability. Actual results could differ\nfrom those estimates, and such differences could be material and may result in other than temporary reduction in fair value, which could lead to additional\nimpairments in the carrying value of the Ultimaker investment.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 the equity investment in Ultimaker amounts to $67.8 million and $100.2 million, respectively, which\nrepresents the original investment in Ultimaker, net of share in net losses for the years in the amounts of $32.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nCovestro acquisition\nOn April 3, 2023 (the “Covestro transaction date”), the Company completed the acquisition of the additive manufacturing materials business of Covestro AG.\nCovestro’s additive manufacturing business is expected to give the Company the ability to accelerate innovative developments in 3D printing materials and to\nthereby further grow adoption of its newest technologies. Also, the Company acquired an IP portfolio comprised of hundreds of patents and pending patents,\nincluding all of the SOMOS™ portfolio.\nThe Covestro transaction is reflected in accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations”. The assets acquisition transaction meets the definition of a\nbusiness and was accounted for as a “Business Combinations” transaction, using the acquisition method of accounting with the Company as the acquirer. The\nfollowing table summarizes the fair value of the consideration transferred to Covestro AG for the Covestro transaction:\nU.S. $ in thousands\nCash payments $ 53,815\nIssuance of ordinary shares to Covestro stockholders 5,202\nContingent consideration at estimated fair value 659\nOther liability 868\nTotal consideration $ 60,544\nThe fair value of the ordinary shares issued was determined based on the closing market price of the Company's ordinary shares on the Covestro transaction\ndate.\nF-22\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 805, the estimated contingent consideration as of the Covestro transaction date was included in the purchase price. The total\ncontingent payments could amount to a maximum aggregate amount of up to €37 million. The payment will be settled through the issuance of ordinary shares. The\nestimated fair value of the contingent consideration is based on management’s assessment of whether, and at what level, the financial metrics will be achieved, and\nthe present value factors associated with the timing of the payments. This fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs in the market and\nthus represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration will be recorded in operating expenses.\nRefer to Note 5.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Covestro transaction date. The estimated fair\nvalues are based on the information that was available as of April 3, 2023. The allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is as\nfollows:\nAllocation of Purchase Price\n(U.S. $ in thousands)\nInventory $ 10,342\nFixed assets 7,064\nIntangible assets 21,929\nOther liabilities (605)\nTotal identifiable net assets 38,730\nGoodwill $ 21,814\nThe allocation of the PPA to net assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in the recognition of intangible assets related to developed technology,\ncustomer relationship, and trade name. These intangible assets have a useful life of 7 to 10 years. The fair value estimate of the customer relationship was\ndetermined using a variation of the income approach known as the “Multi-Period Excess Earnings Approach”. This valuation technique estimates the fair value of\nan asset based on market participants’ expectations of the cash flows the asset would generate over its remaining useful life. The net cash flows were discounted to\npresent value. The fair value estimate of the developed technology and trade name, were estimated using the \"Relief from royalty\" method. This valuation\ntechnique estimates the fair value of the asset based on the hypothetical royalty payment that a licensee would be required to pay in exchange for use of the asset.\nGoodwill was recorded as the residual amount by which the purchase price exceeded the provisional fair value of the net assets acquired and is expected to be fully\ndeductible for tax purposes. Goodwill consists primarily of expected synergies of combining operations, the acquired workforce, and growth opportunities, none of\nwhich qualify as separately identifiable intangible assets.\nPro forma information giving effect to the acquisition has not been provided, as the results would not be material.\nDuring 2023, the Company completed several transactions, including acquisitions of an entity and additional assets, for a total consideration of $22 million.\nOther long-term investments\nIn addition to the investment in Ultimaker, other investments included under Long-term investments represents investments in non-marketable equity securities and\nconvertible notes of several companies without readily determinable fair value in which the Company does not have a controlling interest or significant influence.\nOne entity from this group became public during the first quarter of 2021 and accordingly the investment is now treated as a marketable equity investment. During\n2023 and 2022, the Company invested a total of $11.5 million and $16.7 million in non-marketable equity securities and convertible notes of several companies.\nF-23\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestructuring plan\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company initiated certain restructuring activities for some parts of its operations, as part of aligning the business to\nthe Company's growth strategy and streamlining the organization for improved efficiency. In connection with these activities, certain operations were discontinued,\nand others were divested. These restructuring activities resulted in an impairment charge to fixed assets, inventory write-off, employees related expenses and other\ncharges for a total amount of $19.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023 the Company recorded restructuring charges of $12.3 million, $2.7 million\nand $4.2 million under Cost of sales, Research and development and Selling, general and administrative, respectively. The restructuring activities were\nsubstantially completed by December 31, 2023.\nNote 3. Recent developments\nTermination of Merger Agreement with Desktop Metal\nOn May 25, 2023, the Company and Desktop Metal, Inc. (“Desktop Metal”), jointly announced their entry into a merger agreement, whereby a wholly-owned\nDelaware subsidiary of the company was to merge with and into Desktop Metal, with Desktop Metal surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the\nCompany. On September 28, 2023, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders, at which the merger was presented for the approval of\nthe Company’s shareholders. The merger proposal was not approved by the Company’s shareholders at that meeting, and accordingly, pursuant to its rights under\nthe merger agreement, Stratasys terminated the merger agreement with Desktop Metal, effective immediately on September 28, 2023. As a result, the Company\nrecorded a termination fee of $10.0 million, which was included under selling, general & administrative expenses and was paid to Desktop Metal.\nNano Dimension Tender Offer and Board Contest\nOn May 25, 2023, following the announcement of the then-prospective merger with Desktop Metal, Nano Dimension Ltd. (“Nano”), a 14.1% shareholder of the\nCompany, launched a hostile partial tender offer whereby it sought to acquire—including shares already held by it— between 53% and 55% of the Company’s\noutstanding ordinary shares, at a price of $18.00 per share. The tender offer was subject to various conditions and was originally set to expire on June 26, 2023.\nOver the course of subsequent periods of time, the price offered by Nano in its tender offer was ultimately raised to $25.00 per share, with an accompanying\nreduction as to the percentage of Company shares to be held by it upon consummation of the offer, to between 46% and 51%, and the offer was extended\nultimately through July 31, 2023. The offer expired on July 31, 2023 and Nano did not receive enough tendered shares and was therefore unable to complete the\npurchase of any of the Company ordinary shares pursuant to the offer. Nano has recently re-initiated its pursuit of an acquisition of the Company, announcing on\nDecember 23, 2023 a preliminary proposal to purchase all outstanding shares of the Company that it does not currently own for $16.50 per share in cash. The\nCompany has acknowledged receipt of Nano’s offer, and has indicated that its board of directors would consider it as part of the process to explore strategic\nalternatives for the Company.\nThe Company has also been subject to litigation with Nano in an Israeli district court regarding the Company's shareholder rights plan, Nano’s tender offer,\nand the contested board election. The litigation has not changed the outcome of any of the developments described above. Please see note 11.\n3D Systems Offers\nOn May 30, 2023, and then again on June 27, 2023, the Company received an unsolicited non-binding indicative proposal from 3D Systems Corporation (“3D\nSystems”) to merge with the Company. On July 13, 2023, the Company received an updated proposal from 3D Systems, pursuant to which it would merge with the\nCompany for $7.50 in cash and 1.5444 newly issued shares of common stock of 3D Systems per Stratasys ordinary share. The Stratasys board at first determined\nthat the 3D Systems proposal of July 13th would reasonably be expected to result in a “Superior Proposal” under the merger agreement with Desktop Metal and\nF-24\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nauthorized Company management to enter into discussions with 3D Systems with respect to the proposal. Following an extensive due diligence process, Stratasys\ncommunicated its concerns regarding the 3D Systems’ proposal to 3D Systems and indicated that the last proposal was not itself a transaction which Stratasys\nwould be prepared to enter into. 3D Systems revised its proposal on September 6, 2023, offering $7.00 in cash and 1.6387 newly issued shares of common stock of\n3D Systems per Stratasys ordinary share. After consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, the Stratasys board of directors unanimously determined\nthat the September 6 proposal continued to significantly undervalue Stratasys and did not constitute a “Superior Proposal” pursuant to the terms of the merger\nagreement with Desktop Metal, and accordingly terminated discussions with 3D Systems.\nInitiation of Strategic Alternatives Process\nOn September 28, 2023, the Company announced that it has initiated a comprehensive process to explore strategic alternatives for the Company. The\nCompany noted that following the termination of the merger agreement with Desktop Metal, Stratasys is no longer subject to restrictions under that agreement\nregarding the solicitation of or entry into potential transactions.\nNote 4.

The Company expects to recognize $64.7 million of this RPO during the next 12 months, $20.1 million over the subsequent 12 months and the\nremaining $15.7 million thereafter.\nF-26\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIncremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract\nSales commissions earned mainly by the Company’s sales agents are considered incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as the Company\nexpects the benefit of those commissions to be longer than one year. The majority of the sales commissions are not subject to capitalization as the commission\nexpense is recognized as the related revenue is recognized. Sales commissions for initial contracts related to the service type warranty are deferred and then\namortized on a straight-line basis over the expected customer relationship period (generally 5 years) if the Company expects to recover those costs. The Company\ndetermined the period of benefit by taking into consideration customer contracts including renewals, the technology and other factors. Amortization expense is\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the deferred commission\namounted to $10.3 million and $9.6 million, respectively and presented under Other current assets and Other non-current assets.\nF-27\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 5.

Based on the Company's qualitative analysis,\nwhich considered the Company's market valuation, its operation results and projections, and the timing of its goodwill acquisitions, no goodwill was determined to\nbe impaired as of December 31, 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company noted that indicators of potential impairment existed which required an interim goodwill impairment analysis\nfor Stratasys-Core reporting unit. These indicators included sustained decline in the Company’s market capitalization during the last quarter primarily as a result of\nthe global economy and the potential impact on the Company's business segment.\nThe Company performed a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment for its Stratasys-Core reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of Stratasys-\nCore reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying amount with a goodwill assigned to this reporting unit in the amount of $65.0 million. When evaluating the\nfair value of Stratasys-Core reporting unit under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow model which utilized Level 3 measures that\nrepresent unobservable inputs. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value include: (a) internal cash flows forecasts for 5 years following the\nassessment date, including expected revenue growth, costs to produce, operating profit margins and estimated capital needs; (b) an estimated terminal value using a\nterminal year long term future growth determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a discount rate which reflects the weighted average\ncost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the Stratasys-Core reporting unit operations and the uncertainty inherent in the Company's internally\ndeveloped forecasts.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of its cash flow projections used for its goodwill impairment analysis, the Company compared the aggregate fair value of\nits reporting units to its market capitalization and calculated the implied control premium. The Company believes that its fair value assessment is reasonably\nsupported by its calculated market capitalization.\nBased on the Company’s assessment as of December 31, 2022, no goodwill was determined to be impaired.\nGoodwill impairment assessment for the year ended December 31, 2023\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment test for goodwill impairment.\nThe Company performed a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment for its Stratasys-Core reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of Stratasys-\nCore reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 34%, with a carrying amount of goodwill assigned to this reporting unit in an amount of\n$100.0 million. When evaluating the fair value of Stratasys-Core reporting unit under the income approach, the Company used a discounted cash flow model\nwhich utilized Level 3 measures that represent unobservable inputs. Key assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value include: (a) internal cash flows\nforecasts for 4 years following the assessment date, including expected revenue growth, costs to produce, operating profit margins and estimated capital needs; (b)\nan estimated terminal value using a terminal year long- term future growth determined based on the growth prospects of the reporting unit; and (c) a discount rate\nwhich reflects the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with the Stratasys-Core reporting unit operations and the uncertainty\ninherent in the Company's internally developed forecasts.\nIn order to assess the reasonableness of its cash flow projections used for its goodwill impairment analysis, the Company compared the aggregate fair value of\nits reporting units to its market capitalization and calculated the implied control premium. The Company believes that its fair value assessment is reasonably\nsupported by its calculated market capitalization.\nActual results may differ from those assumed in the Company's valuation method. It is reasonably possible that the Company's assumptions described above\ncould change in future periods. If any of these were to vary materially from the Company's plans, it may record impairment of goodwill allocated to this reporting\nunit in the future.\nF-30\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBased on the Company’s assessment as of December 31, 2023, no goodwill was determined to be impaired.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the fair value of its Stratasys-Core reporting unit to determine whether events and changes in circumstances such as\nfurther deterioration in the business climate or operating results, significant decline in the Company's share price, changes in management’s business strategy or\ndownward changes of the Company's cash flows projections, warrant further interim impairment testing.\nNote 9.

Those tax losses carry-\nforward resulted in deferred tax assets of approximately $682.1 million and $678.3 million, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As a result of losses\nincurred in the last few years, and since the near-term realization of these assets is uncertain, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax\nassets that are not likely to be realized.\nF-32\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSignificant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance,\nthe Company considered all available evidence, including past operating results, the most recent projections for taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax\nplanning strategies. The Company reassess its valuation allowance periodically and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance,\na tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of valuation allowance is as follows:\nValuation Allowance\nU.S. $ in thousands\nBalance at January 1, 2021 $ 661,979\nAdditions 31,141\nBalance at December 31, 2021 693,120\nAdditions 8,788\nDecrease (2,214)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 699,694\nAdditions 38,500\nDecrease (634)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 737,560\nIncluded in the net deferred tax are net operating loss and credit carryovers of $137.2 million which expire in years ending from December 31, 2032 through\nDecember 31, 2042, whereas some losses may be carried forward indefinitely, as discussed below\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted into law. The new legislation represents fundamental and dramatic modifications to\nthe U.S. tax system. The Act contained several key tax provisions that impacted the Company's U.S. subsidiaries, including the reduction of the maximum U.S.\nfederal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Other significant changes under the Act included, among others, a one-time\nrepatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, a limitation of net operating loss deduction to 80% of taxable income, and indefinite carryover of post-2017 net\noperating losses. The Act also repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Losses generated prior to January\n1, 2018 will still be subject to the 20-year carryforward limitation and the alternative minimum tax. Other impacts due to the Act included the repeal of the\ndomestic manufacturing deduction, modification of taxation of controlled foreign corporations, a base erosion anti-abuse tax, modification of interest expense\nlimitation rules, modification of limitation on deductibility of excessive executive compensation, and taxation of global intangible low-taxed income.\nThe Act introduced new intangible income rules, Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII). The Company\nhas analyzed the impact of GILTI/FDII and determined that no impact should be recorded due to the U.S. subsidiaries’ net operating losses. Thus, the Company\ncannot elect to include these amounts in the measurement of its deferred taxes under U.S. GAAP.\nF-33\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEffective in 2022, the Act requires all U.S. companies to capitalize, and subsequently amortize R&D expenses that fall within the scope of Section 174 over five\nyears for research activities conducted in the United States and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside of the United States, rather than\ndeducting such costs in the year incurred for tax purposes. Although Congress is considering legislation that would repeal and defer this capitalization and\namortization requirement for research activities performed in the United States, there is no assurance that this provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. As\nof financial year 2023, we have accounted for an estimate of the effects of the R&D capitalization, based on interpretation of the law as currently enacted. To the\nextent that this provision is not deferred, modified or repealed, and once our available Federal NOLs are fully utilized, we would incur an increase in our tax\nexpenses and a decrease in our cash flows provided by operations. To date, we incurred immaterial tax expense and corresponding cashflow impact at State level\nonly.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted into law in response to the economic fallout of the\nCOVID- 19 pandemic in the United States. Among the many business-related provisions, some of which related to non-income taxes, were changes made to net\noperating losses (NOLs). The CARES Act amended Internal Revenue Code Section 172(b)(1) for tax years beginning in 2018, 2019 and 2020, requiring taxpayers\nto carry back NOLs arising in those years to the five preceding tax years, unless the taxpayer elects to waive or reduce the carryback period. To the extent unused\nas a carryback, these NOLs are now carried forward indefinitely. The CARES Act suspended the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act’s 80% limitation on NOL deductions for\ntax years beginning in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The 80% limitation will be reinstated for tax years beginning after 2020, for NOLs arising in tax years after 2017.\nThe Company believes that all future profits of its subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested or that there is no expectation to distribute any taxable dividends\nfrom these subsidiaries. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is estimated as an\nimmaterial amount.\nb.

During the ordinary course of\nbusiness, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company establishes reserves for tax-related\nuncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when the Company believes that\ncertain positions might be challenged despite its belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable. The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing\nfacts and circumstances, such as the outcome of a tax audit or changes in the tax law. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and\nchanges to reserves that are considered appropriate.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of uncertain tax positions is as follows:\nF-35\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of year $ 6,043 $ 3,015 $ 23,389\nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year 3,636 4,684 3,826\nForeign currency impact — 181 2,918\nDecrease related to settlements with tax authorities and lapse of applicable statutes of limitation (458) (500) (26,685)\nClassification to DTA (362) (1,337) (433)\nBalance at end of year $ 8,859 $ 6,043 $ 3,015\nThe Company’s accrual for estimated interest and penalties was $0.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S., various states, Israel and certain other foreign jurisdictions. The Company files income tax returns in\nvarious jurisdictions with varying statutes of limitations. Tax returns of Stratasys Inc. submitted in the United States through 2016 tax year are considered to be\nfinal following the completion of the Internal Revenue Service examination. Tax returns of Stratasys Ltd. submitted in Israel through the 2019 tax year are\nconsidered to be final following the completion of the Israeli Tax Authorities examination upon audit. The expiration of the statute of limitations related to the\nvarious other foreign and state income tax returns that the Company and its subsidiaries file vary by state and foreign jurisdictions.\nc. Basis of taxation:\nThe enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the Company’s major subsidiaries outside of Israel are as follows:\nCompany incorporated in the U.S.— Federal tax rate of approximately 21%.\nCompany incorporated in Germany—tax rate of approximately 29%.\nCompany incorporated in Hong Kong—tax rate of approximately 16.5%.\nA significant portion of the Company’s income is taxed in Israel. The following is a summary of how the Company’s income is taxed in Israel:\nCorporate tax rates in Israel for 2018 and thereafter is 23%. The Company elected to compute its taxable income in accordance with Income Tax Regulations\n(Rules for Accounting for Foreign Investors Companies and Certain Partnerships and Setting their Taxable Income), 1986. Accordingly, the Company’s taxable\nincome or loss is calculated in U.S. dollars. Applying these regulations reduces the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations (of the NIS in relation to the U.S.\ndollar) on the Company’s Israeli taxable income.\nTax benefits under the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxation), 1969\nThe Company is an “Industrial Company” as defined by the Israeli Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxation), 1969, and, as such, is entitled to certain\ntax benefits including accelerated depreciation, deduction of public offering expenses in three equal annual installments and amortization of other intangible\nproperty rights for tax purposes.\nTax benefits under the Law for Encouragement of Capital Investments, 1959 (the “Investment Law”)\nTax incentives programs which were relevant for the company until financial year 2020\nVarious industrial projects of the Company have been granted “Approved Enterprise” and “Beneficiary Enterprise” status, which provided certain benefits,\nincluding tax exemptions for undistributed income and reduced tax rates. Income not eligible for Approved Enterprise and Beneficiary Enterprise benefits is taxed\nat the regular corporate rate, which was 23% in 2021.\nF-36\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company is a Foreign Investors Company, or FIC, as defined by the Investment Law. FICs are entitled to further reductions in the tax rate normally\napplicable to Approved Enterprises and Beneficiary Enterprises, depending on the level of foreign ownership. When foreign (non-Israeli) ownership equal or\nexceeds 90%, the Approved Enterprise and Beneficiary Enterprise income is either tax-exempt for a limit period between two to ten years depending on the\nlocation of the enterprise or taxable at a tax rate of 10% for a 10 years period. The Company cannot assure that it will continue to qualify as a FIC in the future or\nthat the benefits described herein will be granted in the future.\nIn the event of distribution of dividends (or deemed distribution, as described below) from the said tax-exempt income during the tax exemption period as\ndescribed above, the amount distributed will be subject to tax in respect of the amount of dividend distributed (grossed up to reflect such pre-tax income that it\nwould have had to earn in order to distribute the dividend) at the corporate tax rate that would have been otherwise applicable if such income had not been tax-\nexempted under the alternative benefits program. This rate generally ranges from 10% to 25%, depending on the level of foreign investment in the company in\neach year, as explained above, Dividends paid out of income attributed to Approved Enterprise or Beneficiary Enterprise (or out of dividends received from a\ncompany whose income is attributed to an Approved or Beneficiary Enterprise) are generally subject to withholding tax at the source at the rate of 15%, unless a\nlower rate is provided in a treaty between Israel and the shareholder’s country of residence (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel\nTax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate).\nThe 15% tax rate is limited to dividends and distributions out of income derived during the benefits period and actually paid at any time up to 12 years\nthereafter. After this period, the withholding tax is applied at a rate of up to 30%, or at the lower rate under an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in\nadvance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate). In the case of an FIC, the 12-year limitation on reduced withholding\ntax on dividends does not apply.\nOn November 15, 2021, the Investment Law was amended to reduce the ability of companies to retain the tax-exempt profits. Effective August 15, 2021,\ndividend distributions (or deemed distribution, as described below), will be treated as if made on a pro-rata basis from all types of earnings, including Exempt\nProfits (as defined below).\nIn parallel to the above amendment, the Investment Law was amended to provide, on a temporary basis, a reduced corporate income tax on the distribution or\nrelease within a year from such amendment of tax-exempt profits derived by Approved and Benefited Enterprises, which we refer to as Exempt Profits (the\n“Temporary Provision\"). The amount of the reduced tax will be determined based on a formula. In order to qualify for the reduction, the Company must invest\ncertain amounts in productive assets and research and development in Israel.\nFollowing a recent Israeli district court ruling (which is subject to deliberation of the Supreme Court), certain transactions (such as acquisitions and\nintercompany loans) may be treated as deemed dividend distributions for the purpose of the Encouragement Law triggering corporate tax on the respective amount\nof the transaction.\nOn November 13, 2022, according to the Temporary Provision, the Company released an amount of approximately $44.8 million out of its Exempt Profits and\naccordingly paid reduced tax of approximately $2.9 million.\nAs of December 31, 2023, remaining tax-exempt income of approximately $157.6 million is attributable to the Company’s various Approved and Beneficiary\nEnterprise programs. If such tax-exempt income is distributed, it would be taxed at the reduced corporate tax rate applicable to such income, and taxes of\napproximately $15.8 million would be incurred as of December 31, 2023.\nF-37\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTax incentives programs which may be relevant for the company starting from financial year 2021\nA January 2011 amendment to the Investment Law (the “2011 Amendment”) created alternative benefit tracks to those previously in place, as follows: an\ninvestment grants track designed for enterprises located in certain development zones and two new tax benefits tracks (“Preferred Enterprise” and “Special\nPreferred Enterprise”), which provide for application of a unified tax rate to all preferred income of the Company, as defined in the Investment Law.\nThe 2011 Amendment canceled the availability of the benefits granted in accordance with the provisions of the Investment Law prior to 2011 and, instead,\nintroduced new benefits for income generated by a “Preferred Company” through its “Preferred Enterprise” (as such terms are defined in the Investment Law)\neffective as of January 1, 2011 and thereafter. A Preferred Company is defined as either (i) a company incorporated in Israel which is not wholly owned by a\ngovernmental entity, or (ii) a limited partnership that: (a) was registered under the Israeli Partnerships Ordinance, and (b) all of its limited partners are companies\nincorporated in Israel, but not all of them are governmental entities; which has, among other things, Preferred Enterprise status and is controlled and managed from\nIsrael. Pursuant to the 2011 Amendment, a Preferred Company was entitled to a reduced corporate tax rate of 16% with respect to its preferred income attributed to\nits Preferred Enterprise, unless the Preferred Enterprise was located in a certain development zone, in which case the rate was 9%. In 2017 and thereafter, the\ncorporate tax rate for Preferred Enterprise which is located in a certain development zone was decreased to 7.5%, while the reduced corporate tax rate for other\ndevelopment zones remains 16%.\nDividends paid out of preferred income attributed to a Preferred Enterprise are generally subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 20%, or such lower\nrate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty (subject to the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax\nrate). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli company, no tax is required to be withheld (although, if such dividends are subsequently distributed to\nindividuals or a non-Israeli company, withholding tax at a rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty will apply.\nNew Tax benefits under the 2017 Amendment that became effective on January 1, 2017.\nThe 2017 Amendment was enacted as part of the Economic Efficiency Law that was published on December 29, 2016, and was effective as of January 1, 2017.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides new tax benefits for two types of “Technology Enterprises”, as described below, and is in addition to the other existing tax\nbeneficial programs under the Investment Law.\nThe 2017 Amendment provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions will qualify as a “Preferred Technology Enterprise” and will thereby\nenjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 12% on income that qualifies as “Preferred Technology Income,” as defined in the Investment Law. The tax rate is further\nreduced to7.5% for a Preferred Technology Enterprise located in development zone A. In addition, a Preferred Technology Company will enjoy a reduced\ncorporate tax rate of 12% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain “Benefited Intangible Assets” (as defined in the Investment Law) to a related foreign\ncompany if the Benefited Intangible Assets were acquired from a foreign company on or after January 1, 2017 for at least NIS 200 million, and the sale receives\nprior approval from the Israeli Innovation Authority, to which we refer as the IIA.\nF-38\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe 2017 Amendment further provides that a technology company satisfying certain conditions will qualify as a “Special Preferred Technology Enterprise” and\nwill thereby enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on “Preferred Technology Income” regardless of the company’s geographic location within Israel. In\naddition, a Special Preferred Technology Enterprise will enjoy a reduced corporate tax rate of 6% on capital gain derived from the sale of certain “Benefited\nIntangible Assets” to a related foreign company if the Benefited Intangible Assets were either developed by an Israeli company or acquired from a foreign\ncompany on or after January 1, 2017, and the sale received prior approval from the IIA. A Special Preferred Technology Enterprise that acquires Benefited\nIntangible Assets from a foreign company for more than NIS 500 million will be eligible for these benefits for at least ten years, subject to certain approvals as\nspecified in the Investment Law Dividends distributed by a Preferred Technology Enterprise or a Special Preferred Technology Enterprise, paid out of Preferred\nTechnology Income, are generally subject to withholding tax at source at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be provided in an applicable tax treaty (subject\nto the receipt in advance of a valid certificate from the Israel Tax Authority allowing for a reduced tax rate). However, if such dividends are paid to an Israeli\ncompany, no tax is required to be withheld. If such dividends are distributed to a foreign company and other conditions are met, the withholding tax rate will be\n4%.\nIn 2021, the Company noticed the Israeli tax authorities that it waived the Approved / Beneficiary Enterprise regime starting from tax year 2021. The Company\nis currently considering its qualification for the 2017 Amendment and the term and degree to which it may be qualified as a Preferred Technology Enterprise or\nSpecial Preferred Technology Enterprise.\nPillar Two Taxation\nThe OECD introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Pillar Two rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15% for large multinational\ncorporations. On December 12, 2022, the EU Council announced that EU member states had reached an agreement to implement the minimum taxation component\nof 15% of the OECD’s reform of international taxation.

Commitments and contingencies\nLegal proceedings\nLitigation with Nano Dimension regarding Stratasys’ Rights Plan and Nano Dimension’s tender offer\nOn April 25, 2023, the Company was named as a defendant in an action filed by Nano in the Tel-Aviv District Court in which Nano sought declaratory relief\ndeclaring that Stratasys’ shareholder rights plan is both illegal and void, and also requested a court order enjoining the Company and its directors from intervening\nwith, or hindering in any way, a tender offer that Nano at the time intended to launch to acquire Stratasys ordinary shares.\nOn June 8, 2023, in its statement of defense, the Company rejected all of Nano’s claims, stating, among other things, that there was a substantial change of\ncircumstance since Nano’s action was filed due to Stratasys’ entry into the Desktop Metal Merger Agreement on May 25, 2023 and the launch of Nano’s tender\noffer on May 25, 2023. The Company argued that its rights plan is legal under Israeli law, and that due to the many flaws and unlawful conditions of Nano’s tender\noffer and Nano’s conduct and circumstances, The Company’s board was obligated to get involved and protect the Company and its shareholders. The Company\nalso submitted a counterclaim to the court, seeking an order restraining Nano from completing its tender offer until certain conditions were to be fulfilled.\nF-39\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn July 18, 2023, in the context of an interim procedural decision, the Israeli court took the opportunity to express its preliminary view on the legality of\nshareholder rights plans for Israeli companies. The court indicated that it is inclined to view rights plans as permissible under Israeli law; that the adoption of a\nrights plan by a board should be viewed “with suspicion”; and that the board would bear the burden of proving certain matters related to the adoption of such a\nplan.\nAfter Nano’s tender offer expired on July 31, 2023, the Tel-Aviv District Court decided that the litigation should be put on hold. On October 10, 2023, the court\nissued an order instructing the parties to inform it whether they consent to the dismissal of the claim and counter-claim, with no order for costs. On November 15,\n2023, Nano informed the court that it requests to resume the proceedings. On December 19, 2023, the court issued an order noting that, from the parties' written\nsubmissions, it is appropriate to rule upon one critical question: whether, under Israeli law, a company can adopt a ‘poison pill’ (i.e., a shareholder rights plan). The\ncourt further noted that Nano should consider either amending its claim or withdrawing it and filing a new one. The court emphasized that no new evidence will be\nallowed and that should Nano choose to proceed with the current action, the only question to be considered by the court is the validity of the poison pill under\nIsraeli law. Nano is due to file its position paper with the court by March 17, 2024.\nLitigation with Nano Dimension regarding Stratasys board election\nIn a separate action, on July 13, 2023, Nano filed a motion in an Israeli court requesting that the court order, among other things, that (i) the Company correct\nthe agenda sent out to its shareholders in advance of an annual general shareholder meeting scheduled for August 8, 2023, so that the agenda would include Nano’s\nindividual director nominees for the Company’s board, and (ii) the Company issue a new proxy statement and proxy card for the annual general shareholder\nmeeting.\nOn July 28, 2023, Nano issued a press release in which it announced that it intends to withdraw its nominees for the Company’s board, which Nano reiterated in\na press release that it issued on August 1, 2023.\nOn September 26, 2023, at the parties’ request, the court dismissed the proceedings, without prejudice.\nOrdinary course litigation\nIn addition to the foregoing litigations, the Company is also a party to various legal proceedings from time to time, the outcome of which, in the opinion of\nmanagement, will not have a significant effect on the financial position, profitability or cash flows of the Company.\nRoyalty commitments\nAs part of its acquisition of XAAR 3D on November 1, 2021, the Company assumed a royalty liability to a third party in respect of the developed technology.\nSuch liability was recorded based on a fair value estimate, which was determined using the valuation model used to value the developed technology and is\nrecorded under other non-current liabilities. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022 the royalty liability amounted to $8.4 millions, $9.3 millions, respectively.\nNote 12. Equity\na.

The increase in the issued and\noutstanding ordinary shares during 2023 was attributable to exercises of stock options and RSUs under the Company’s stock-based compensation plans (including\nits ESPP). During 2022 the reserve pool under the 2022 Plan was increased by 1.5 million shares.\nb. Stock-based compensation plans\nThe Stratasys Ltd. 2012 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”), which became effective upon closing of the Stratasys-Core merger, provides for the\ngrant of options, restricted shares, RSUs, PSUs and other share-based awards to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ respective directors, employees, officers,\nconsultants, and to any other person whose services are considered valuable to the Company or any of its affiliates. Under the 2012 Plan, options, RSUs and PSUs\ngenerally have a contractual term of ten years from the grant date. Options granted become exercisable and RSUs are vested over the requisite service period,\nwhich is normally a four-year period beginning on the grant date, subject to continued service to the Company. PSUs are vested only upon the achievement of\ncertain pre-determined performance metrics. Once the performance metrics are met, vesting of PSUs is subject to continued service to the Company over the\nrequisite service period, which is normally a two-year to four-year period. The 2012 Plan expired pursuant to its own terms in September 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were an aggregate of 8,534,204 ordinary shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2012 Plan, and no further shares\navailable for future equity awards under the 2012 plan, as all remaining shares under the plan were transferred to the new 2022 Plan (as described below) upon the\nexpiration of the 2012 Plan.

Rights plan\nOn July 24, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (the “Initial Rights Plan”) to protect the interests of the Company’s\nshareholders. Each Right entitled the registered holder thereof to purchase from the Company one ordinary share at a price of NIS 0.01 per share, subject to\nadjustment, once the Rights were to become exercisable, and subject to the exercise terms and conditions thereof described in a related Rights Agreement, dated as\nof July 25, 2022, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights agent. The Rights were to become exercisable only if an entity,\nperson, or group were to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding ordinary shares in a transaction not approved by the\nCompany’s Board of Directors. The Initial Rights Plan initially had a 364-day term, expiring on July 24, 2023, which was extended to December 31, 2023. Under a\nThird Amendment to Rights Agreement, entered into on December 21, 2023, the Initial Rights Plan and related Rights Agreement were terminated in conjunction\nwith the adoption of the New Rights Plan (as described below).\nF-44\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn December 21, 2023, prior to the expiration of the Initial Rights Plan, the Company’s Board of Directors unanimously adopted a limited-duration shareholder\nrights plan (the “New Rights Plan”, together with the Initial Rights Plan, collectively, the “Rights Plans”) to protect the interests of the Company’s shareholders, in\nreplacement of the Initial Rights Plan. The New Rights Plan expires on December 19, 2024. The New Rights Plan, if triggered, will significantly dilute the\nownership of any entity, person or group that acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding ordinary shares in a transaction not\napproved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The New Rights Plan contains enhanced shareholder protections that are intended to limit the scope of the New\nRights Plan. The New Rights Plan is designed to give all of the Company’s shareholders (other than an offeror) a way to voice their position directly to the\nCompany’s Board of Directors on certain types of offers and whether the plan should apply to those offers, and in other circumstances to exempt an offer from the\nplan altogether.\nThe adoption of the Rights Plans was intended to protect the long-term interests of Stratasys and all Stratasys shareholders. The Rights Plans were designed to\nreduce the likelihood that any entity, person, or group would gain control of, or significant influence over, Stratasys through the open-market accumulation of the\nCompany’s shares without appropriately compensating all Stratasys shareholders for control. The Rights Plans were meant to encourage anyone seeking to gain a\nsignificant interest in Stratasys to negotiate directly with the Company’s Board of Directors prior to attempting to control or significantly influence the Company.\nFurther to those goals, the Rights could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that would acquire 15% or more of the ordinary shares of the Company or\nany existing holder of 15% or more of the ordinary shares who would acquire any additional ordinary shares.\ne. Public offering of ordinary shares\nDuring March 2021, the Company completed a public offering of its ordinary shares in an amount of $218.9 million, net of $11.1 million underwriting\ndiscounts and offering expenses. The total number of shares sold by the Company in the public offering was 7,931,034. The Company recorded a deferred tax asset\nin respect of a tax benefit, arising from the underwriting discounts and offering expenses, as an increase to Additional Paid-In Capital.\nNote 13. Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company carries out transactions involving foreign currency exchange derivative financial instruments. The transactions are designed to hedge the\nCompany’s exposure to change in relative value of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect\nto recognized assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions denominated in the New Israeli Shekel (“NIS”) and, the Euro. Gains and losses on the hedging\ninstruments offset losses and gains on the hedged items.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated balance sheets classification and fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments:\nF-45\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value Notional Amount\nDec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31, Dec 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nU.S. $ in thousands\nAssets derivatives -Foreign exchange contracts, not Other current assets\ndesignated as hedging instruments $ 164 $ 159 $ 82,873 $ 101,733\nAssets derivatives -Foreign exchange contracts, Other current assets\ndesignated as cash flow hedge 2,087 3 51,830 4,900\nLiability derivatives -Foreign exchange contracts, not Accrued expenses and other\ndesignated as hedging instruments current liabilities (51) (38) 21,168 16,751\nLiability derivatives -Foreign exchange contracts, Accrued expenses and other\ndesignated as cash flow hedge current liabilities (657) (1,640) 74,054 72,273\n$ 1,543 $ (1,516) $ 229,925 $ 195,657\nForeign exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments\nAs of December 31, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding exchange forward contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, were\n$104.0 million and were used to reduce foreign currency exposures of the Euro, New Israeli Shekel (the “NIS”),British Pound, Japanese Yen, Korean Won and\nChinese Yuan. With respect to such derivatives, gain of $0.5 million and gain of $2.1 million were recognized under financial income (expenses) , net for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Such gains partially offset the revaluation losses of the balance sheet items, which are also recognized under\nfinancial income (expenses), net.\nCash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Payroll and other operating expenses\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had in effect foreign exchange forward contracts for the conversion of $46.2 million and $64.4 million,\nrespectively, into NIS. These foreign exchange forward contracts were designated as cash flow hedge for accounting purposes. The Company uses short-term cash\nflow hedge contracts to reduce its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting mainly from payroll costs denominated in New Israeli Shekels.\nThe changes in fair value of those contracts are included in the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nCash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue\nThe Company transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. The Company may use foreign exchange or forward contracts to hedge certain\ncash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up\nto twelve months. The Company enters into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the\nnormal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had in effect foreign exchange forward contracts, designated as cash flow hedge for accounting purposes, for the\nconversion of €72.0 million into dollars.\nF-46\nSTRATASYS LTD.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and the hedges must be highly effective\nin offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions. The Company record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) in its consolidated balance sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction occurs, we reclassify the\nrelated gain or loss to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, the Company\nreclassifies the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to the same statement of operations line item as\nthe hedged item. If the Company does not elect hedge accounting, or the contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in fair value from\nperiod to period are recorded under financial income (expenses), net.\nResearch and development, Selling, general and Financial (expenses) Other comprehensive\nRevenues Cost of sales net administrative income, net income\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31,\n2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022\nU.S. $ in thousands\nLine items in which\neffects of hedges are\nrecorded $ 627,598 $ 651,483 $ 360,574 $ 375,016 $ 94,425 $ 92,876 $ 260,179 $ 240,750 $ (2,993)$ (229) $ 5,739 $ (4,047)\nForeign exchange\ncontracts designated\nas hedging instrument 1,578 3,625 472 243 1,604 950 3,030 1,941 — — (1,797) (1,566)\nForeign exchange\ncontracts not\ndesignated as hedging\ninstrument — — — — — — — — (470) (2,125) — —\nNote 14.

Ordinary Shares\nThe Stratasys Ltd. (hereinafter, “we”, “us”, “our” or similar expressions) authorized share capital consists of 180 million ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.01 per share.\nAs of February 14, 2024, 69,750,397 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding.\nWe may from time to time, by approval of a majority of our shareholders, increase our authorized share capital. Our fully paid ordinary shares are issued in registered form\nand are freely transferable under our amended and restated articles of association, as further amended (to which we refer herein as our amended articles). Under the Israeli\nCompanies Law, 5759-1999, or the Companies Law, we are required to maintain a major shareholder register listing for shareholders holding 5% or more of our outstanding\nordinary shares.\nOur amended articles and the laws of the State of Israel do not restrict the ownership or voting of ordinary shares by non-residents of Israel, except with respect to\nindividuals and entities that are residents of countries in a state of war with Israel, and except with respect to entities which are controlled by residents of countries in a state of\nwar with Israel.\nListing, Register Number and Purpose\nOur ordinary shares are listed and traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol “SSYS.”\nOur registration number at the Israeli Registrar of Companies is 51-260769-8. Our purpose under our memorandum of association includes every lawful purpose.\nDividend and Liquidation Rights\nHolders of our ordinary shares are entitled to their proportionate share of any cash dividend, share dividend or dividend in kind declared with respect to our ordinary shares.\nWe may declare dividends out of profits legally available for distribution. Under the Companies Law, a company may distribute a dividend only if the distribution does not\ncreate a reasonably foreseeable risk that the company will be unable to meet its existing and anticipated obligations as they become due. A company may only distribute a\ndividend out of the company’s profits, as defined under the Companies Law.\nUnder the Companies Law, the declaration of a dividend does not require the approval of the shareholders of a company unless the company’s articles of association\nprovide otherwise. Our amended articles provide that our board of directors may declare and distribute dividends without the approval of the shareholders.\nIn the event of liquidation, holders of our ordinary shares will have the right to share ratably in any assets remaining after payment of liabilities, in proportion to the paid-up\nnominal value of their respective holdings. These rights may be affected by the grant of preferential liquidation or dividend rights to the holders of a class of shares that may be\nauthorized in the future.\nShareholder Meetings\nHolders of ordinary shares have one vote for each ordinary share held on all matters submitted to a vote of shareholders. This right may be changed if shares with special\nvoting rights are authorized in the future.\nUnder the Companies Law, an annual general meeting of our shareholders is required to be held once every calendar year, but no later than 15 months from the date of the\nprevious annual general meeting.\n1\nAll meetings other than the annual general meeting of shareholders are referred to as extraordinary general meetings. Our board of directors may call extraordinary general\nmeetings whenever it sees fit, at such time and place, within or outside of Israel, as it may determine. In addition, the Companies Law and our amended articles provide that our\nboard of directors is required to convene an extraordinary general meeting upon the written request of (i) any two of our directors or one-quarter of our board of directors or (ii)\none or more shareholders holding, in the aggregate, either (a) 5% of our outstanding issued shares and 1% of our outstanding voting power or (b) 5% of our outstanding voting\npower. The Chairman of the Board of Directors or any other person appointed for that purpose by the board of directors, presides at each of our general meetings. The\nChairman of the Board of Directors is not entitled to vote at a general meeting in his capacity as Chairman.\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, shareholders that are entitled to participate and vote at general meetings are the\nshareholders of record on a date decided by our board of directors, which may be between four and 40 days prior to the date of the meeting. Furthermore, the Companies Law\nand the amended articles require that resolutions regarding the following matters must be passed at a general meeting of our shareholders:\n● amendments to the amended articles;\n● appointment or termination of our auditors;\n● appointment of directors and appointment and dismissal of external directors;\n● approval of acts and transactions involving related parties, as defined by the Companies Law or pursuant to our amended articles;\n● director compensation;\n● increases or reductions of our authorized share capital;\n● a merger; and\n● the exercise of our board of directors’ powers by a general meeting, if the board of directors is unable to exercise its powers and the exercise of any of its\npowers is required for our proper management.\nThe Companies Law and the amended articles require that a notice of any annual general meeting or extraordinary general meeting be provided to shareholders at least 21\ndays prior to the meeting, and if the agenda of the meeting includes the appointment or removal of directors, the approval of transactions with office holders or interested or\nrelated parties, or an approval of a merger, notice must be provided at least 35 days prior to the meeting.\nUnder the Companies Law and the amended articles, shareholders are not permitted to take action via written consent in lieu of a meeting.\nVoting Rights\nQuorum requirements\nPursuant to our amended articles, holders of ordinary shares have one vote for each share held on all matters submitted to a vote before the shareholders at a general meeting.\nThe quorum required for a general meeting consists of at least two shareholders present in person, by proxy or written ballot who hold or represent between them at least 25%\nof the total outstanding voting rights. A meeting adjourned for lack of a quorum is generally adjourned to the same day in the following week at the same time and place or to a\nlater time/date if so specified in the summons or notice of the meeting. At the reconvened meeting, any two or more shareholders present in person or by proxy constitute a\nlawful quorum.\n2\nVote requirements\nOur amended articles provide that all resolutions of our shareholders require the approval of a majority of the voting power present and voting at a general meeting, in\nperson or by proxy, unless otherwise required by the Companies Law or by the amended articles. Under the Companies Law, each of (i) the approval of an extraordinary\ntransaction with a controlling shareholder, and (ii) the terms of employment or other engagement of the controlling shareholder of the company or such controlling\nshareholder’s relative (even if not extraordinary) requires, in addition to approval by the audit committee (or, in the case of a compensatory arrangement, the compensation\ncommittee) and the board of directors, approval by a special majority of the shareholders that fulfills one of the following requirements:\n● the majority includes a majority of shareholders who lack a conflict of interest (referred to under the Companies Law as a “personal interest”) in approval of the\ntransaction or terms of employment or engagement (as applicable); or\n● the votes of shareholders who have no conflict of interest in the transaction or terms of employment or engagement and who are present and voting, in person,\nby proxy or by voting deed at the meeting, and who vote against it, may not represent more than two percent (2%) of the voting rights of the company.\nTo the extent that any such transaction with a controlling shareholder is for a period extending beyond three years, approval is required once every three years, unless the\naudit committee determines that the duration of the transaction is reasonable given the circumstances related thereto.\nThe Companies Law generally requires a similar special majority for approval of the terms of employment of the chief executive officer (as with a transaction with a\ncontrolling shareholder that is described above), based on the fulfillment of either of the above two conditions, except that for each such condition, the votes of non-controlling\nshareholders who lack a conflict of interest (instead of just shareholders generally who lack a conflict of interest) count towards fulfillment of the relevant condition.\nUnder our amended articles, if the share capital is divided into classes, the alteration of the rights, privileges, preferences or obligations of any class of share capital will\nrequire approval by a majority of the voting power present and voting, in person or by proxy, at a class meeting of the class so affected (or such other percentage of the relevant\nclass that may be set forth in the governing documents relevant to such class).\nIsraeli law provides that a shareholder of a public company may vote in a meeting and in a class meeting by means of a voting deed in which the shareholder indicates how\nhe or she votes on resolutions relating to the following matters:\n3\n● appointment or removal of directors;\n● approval of transactions with office holders or interested or related parties;\n● approval of a merger or any other matter in respect of which there is a provision in the articles of association providing that decisions of the general meeting\nmay also be passed by voting deed;\n● approval of an arrangement or reorganization of the company pursuant to Section 350 of the Companies Law; and\n● other matters which may be prescribed by Israel’s Minister of Justice.\nThe provision allowing the vote by voting deed does not apply if, to the best knowledge of the company at the time of calling the general shareholders meeting, a\ncontrolling shareholder will hold on the record date for such shareholders meeting, voting power sufficient to determine the outcome of the vote.\nShareholder Duties\nPursuant to the Companies Law, a shareholder has a duty to act in good faith and in a customary manner toward the company and other shareholders and to refrain from\nabusing his or her power in the company, including, among other things, in voting at the general meeting of shareholders and at class shareholder meetings with respect to the\nfollowing matters:\n● an amendment to the company’s articles of association;\n● an increase of the company’s authorized share capital;\n● a merger; or\n● the approval of interested party transactions and acts of office holders that require shareholder approval.\nIn addition, a shareholder also has a general duty to refrain from discriminating against other shareholders.\nIn addition, certain shareholders have a duty of fairness toward the company. These shareholders include any controlling shareholder, any shareholder who knows that it has\nthe power to determine the outcome of a shareholder vote or a shareholder class vote and any shareholder who has the power to appoint or to prevent the appointment of an\noffice holder of the company or other power towards the company. The Companies Law does not define the substance of this duty of fairness, except to state that the remedies\ngenerally available upon a breach of contract will also apply in the event of a breach of the duty to act with fairness.\nAccess to Corporate Records\nUnder the Companies Law and our amended articles, shareholders are provided access to the following corporate records: minutes of our general meetings; our shareholders\nregister and principal shareholders register, articles of association and financial statements; and any document that we are required by law to file publicly with the Israeli\nCompanies Registrar or the Israel Securities Authority. In addition, shareholders may request to be provided with any document related to an action or transaction requiring\nshareholder approval under the related party transaction provisions of the Companies Law. We may deny this request if we believe it has not been submitted in good faith or if\nsuch denial is necessary to protect our interest or protect a trade secret or patent.\n4\nModification of Class Rights\nThe rights attached to any class of shares, such as voting, liquidation and dividend rights, may be amended by adoption of a resolution by the holders of a majority of the\nshares of that class present at a separate class meeting, or otherwise in accordance with the rights attached to such class of shares, as set forth in our amended articles.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nOur transfer agent and registrar in the United States is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nFull Tender Offer\nA person wishing to acquire shares of a public Israeli company and who could as a result hold over 90% of the target company’s issued and outstanding share capital or\nvoting rights is required by the Companies Law to make a tender offer to all of the company’s shareholders for the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the\ncompany. A person wishing to acquire shares of a public Israeli company and who could as a result hold over 90% of the issued and outstanding share capital or voting rights of\na certain class of shares is required to make a tender offer to all of the shareholders who hold shares of the relevant class for the purchase of all of the issued and outstanding\nshares of that class. If the shareholders who do not accept the offer hold less than 5% of the issued and outstanding share capital and voting rights of the company or of the\napplicable class, all of the shares that the acquirer offered to purchase will be transferred to the acquirer by operation of law (provided that a majority of the offerees that do not\nhave a personal interest in such tender offer shall have approved it, which condition shall not apply if, following consummation of the tender offer, the acquirer would hold at\nleast 98% of all of the company’s outstanding shares and voting rights (or shares and voting rights of the relevant class)). However, shareholders may, at any time within six\nmonths following the completion of the tender offer, petition the court to alter the consideration for the acquisition. Even shareholders who indicated their acceptance of the\ntender offer may so petition the court, unless the acquirer stipulated that a shareholder that accepts the offer may not seek appraisal rights). If the shareholders who did not\naccept the tender offer hold 5% or more of the issued and outstanding share capital or voting rights of the company or of the applicable class, the acquirer may not acquire\nshares of the company that will increase its holdings to more than 90% of the company’s issued and outstanding share capital or voting rights or 90% of the shares or voting\nrights of the applicable class, from shareholders who accepted the tender offer.\n5\nSpecial Tender Offer\nThe Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares of a public Israeli company must be made by means of a special tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the\npurchaser could become a holder of 25% or more of the voting rights in the company, unless one of the exemptions in the Companies Law (as described below) is met. This\nrule does not apply if there is already another holder of at least 25% of the voting rights in the company. Similarly, the Companies Law provides that an acquisition of shares in\na public company must be made by means of a tender offer if as a result of the acquisition the purchaser could become a holder of more than 45% of the voting rights in the\ncompany, if there is no other shareholder of the company who holds more than 45% of the voting rights in the company, unless one of the exemptions in the Companies Law is\nmet.\nA special tender offer must be extended to all shareholders of a company but the offeror is not required to purchase shares representing more than 5% of the voting power\nattached to the company’s outstanding shares, regardless of how many shares are tendered by shareholders. A special tender offer may be consummated only if (i) at least 5% of\nthe voting power attached to the company’s outstanding shares will be acquired by the offeror and (ii) the number of shares tendered in the offer exceeds the number of shares\nwhose holders objected to the offer.\nIf a special tender offer is accepted, then the purchaser or any person or entity controlling it or under common control with the purchaser or such controlling person or entity\nmay not make a subsequent tender offer for the purchase of shares of the target company and may not enter into a merger with the target company for a period of one year from\nthe date of the offer, unless the purchaser or such person or entity undertook to effect such an offer or merger in the initial special tender offer.\nMerger\nThe Companies Law permits merger transactions if approved by each party’s board of directors and, unless certain requirements described under the Companies Law are\nmet, by a majority vote of each party’s shares, and, in the case of the target company, a majority vote of each class of its shares, voted on the proposed merger at a shareholders\nmeeting called with at least 35 days’ prior notice.\nFor purposes of the shareholder vote, unless a court rules otherwise, the merger requires approval by a majority of the votes of shares represented at the shareholders’\nmeeting that are held by parties other than the other party to the merger, or by any person (or group of persons acting in concert) who holds (or hold, as the case may be) 25% or\nmore of the voting rights or the right to appoint 25% or more of the directors of the other party to the merger. If, however, the merger involves a merger with a company’s own\ncontrolling shareholder or if the controlling shareholder has a personal interest in the merger, then the merger is instead subject to the same special majority approval that\ngoverns all extraordinary transactions with controlling shareholders (as described above under “Voting Rights—Vote requirements”).\nIf the transaction would have been approved by the shareholders of a merging company but for the separate approval of each class or the exclusion of the votes of certain\nshareholders as provided above, a court may still approve the merger upon the request of holders of at least 25% of the voting rights of a company, if the court holds that the\nmerger is fair and reasonable, taking into account the value of the parties to the merger and the consideration offered to the shareholders of the company that have petitioned the\ncourt to approve the merger.\nUpon the request of a creditor of either party to the proposed merger, the court may delay or prevent the merger if it concludes that there exists a reasonable concern that, as\na result of the merger, the surviving company will be unable to satisfy the obligations of any of the parties to the merger, and may further give instructions to secure the rights of\ncreditors.\nIn addition, a merger may not be consummated unless at least 50 days have passed from the date on which a proposal for approval of the merger was filed by each party\nwith the Israeli Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the date on which the merger was approved by the shareholders of each party.\nPreferred Share Issuance\nUnder the Companies Law, we are allowed to create and issue shares having rights different from those attached to our ordinary shares, including shares providing certain\npreferred rights, distributions or other matters and shares having preemptive rights. No preferred shares are currently authorized under our amended articles. In the future, if we\ndo authorize, create and issue a specific class of preferred shares, such class of shares, depending on the specific rights that may be attached to it, may have the ability to\nfrustrate or prevent a takeover or otherwise prevent our\n6\nshareholders from realizing a potential premium over the market value of their ordinary shares. The authorization and designation of a class of preferred shares will require an\namendment to our amended articles, which requires the prior approval of the holders of a majority of the voting power present and voting, in person or by proxy, at the\napplicable general meeting of our shareholders. The convening of the meeting, the shareholders entitled to participate and the majority vote required to be obtained at such a\nmeeting will be subject to the requirements set forth in the Companies Law as described above under “Voting Rights.”\nBoard of Directors\nUnder the Companies Law, the management of our business is vested in our board of directors. Our board of directors may exercise all powers and may take all actions that\nare not specifically granted to our shareholders or to management. Our executive officers are responsible for our day-to-day management and have individual responsibilities\nestablished by our board of directors. Our Chief Executive Officer is appointed by, and serves at the discretion of, our board of directors, subject to any employment agreement\nthat we may enter into with him. All other executive officers are also appointed by our board of directors, subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreements that we\nmay enter into with them.\nUnder our amended articles, our board of directors must consist of at least seven and not more than 11 directors, including, to the extent applicable, at least two external\ndirectors required to be elected under the Companies Law.\nIn May 2016, we elected to be governed by a newly-adopted exemption under the Companies Law regulations that exempts us from appointing external directors and from\ncomplying with the Companies Law requirements related to the composition of the audit committee and compensation committee of our board of directors. Our eligibility for\nthat exemption is conditioned upon: (i) the continued listing of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market (or one of a few select other non-Israeli stock exchanges); (ii)\nthere not being a controlling shareholder (generally understood to be a 25% or greater shareholder) of our company under the Companies Law; and (iii) our compliance with\nthe Nasdaq Listing Rules requirements as to the composition of (a) our board of directors—which requires that we maintain a majority of independent directors (as defined\nunder the Nasdaq Listing Rules) on our board of directors and (b) the audit and compensation committees of our board of directors (which require that such committees consist\nsolely of independent directors (at least three and two members, respectively), as described under the Nasdaq Listing Rules). At the time that it determined to exempt our\ncompany from the external director requirement, our board affirmatively determined that we meet the conditions for exemption from the external director requirement,\nincluding that a majority of the members of our board, along with each of the members of the audit and compensation committees of the board, are independent under the\nNasdaq Listing Rules.\nAs a result of our election to be exempt from the external director requirement under the Companies Law, each of our directors is elected annually, at our annual general\nmeeting of shareholders. The vote required for the election of each director is a majority of the voting power represented at the meeting and voting on the election proposal.\nOur board of directors may appoint directors to fill vacancies on the board, for a term of office equal to the remaining period of the term of office of the director(s) whose\noffice(s) have been vacated.\nIn accordance with the exemption available to foreign private issuers under the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we do not follow the requirements of the Nasdaq rules with regard to\nthe process of nominating directors. Instead, we follow Israeli law and practice, in accordance with which our board of directors (based on the recommendation of the executive\ncommittee thereof) is authorized to recommend to our shareholders director nominees for election. Under the Companies Law and our amended articles, nominations for\ndirectors may also be made by any shareholder holding at least one percent (1%) of our outstanding voting power. However, any such shareholder may make such a nomination\nonly if a written notice of such shareholder’s intent to make such nomination (together with certain documentation required under the Companies Law) has been delivered to\nour registered Israeli office within seven days after we publish notice of our upcoming annual general meeting (or within 14 days after we publish a preliminary notification of\nan upcoming annual general meeting).\nDescription of Rights to Purchase Stratasys Ltd. Ordinary Shares\nRights and Rights Agreement\n7\nOur board of directors authorized, pursuant to a rights plan, adopted on July 24, 2022, (i) the issuance, on August 4, 2022, of one special purchase right, or Right, for\neach ordinary share outstanding at the close of business on August 4, 2022, or the Record Date, as well as (ii) the issuance of one Right for each ordinary share issued after the\nRecord Date and prior to the earliest of the Issuance Date, the Redemption Date and the Expiration Date (as defined below) (including ordinary shares issued pursuant to the\nexercise, conversion or settlement of securities exercisable for, convertible into or that may be settled for, ordinary shares or rights, in each case, issued or granted prior to, and\noutstanding as of, the Issuance Date). Each Right represents the right to purchase one ordinary share, at a price of $0.01 per share, upon the terms and subject to the conditions\ndescribed below.\nThe Rights were issued pursuant to a rights agreement, dated as of July 25, 2022, between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as rights\nagent. Each Right will allow its holder to purchase from us one ordinary share, at a purchase price of $0.01 per ordinary share, once the Rights become exercisable. Prior to\nexercise, each Right does not give its holder any dividend, voting, liquidation or other rights as a shareholder of ours.\nExercise Period; Rights Certificates\nThe Rights will not be exercisable until the earlier of: (a) the close of business on the tenth day after the public announcement or public disclosure that a person or\ngroup has become an “Acquiring Person” by obtaining beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding ordinary shares (subject to the parameters and exceptions\ndescribed below and in the rights agreement), except if such person or group has become an Acquiring Person pursuant to an offer approved by a majority of the board; or (b)\nthe close of business on the tenth business day (or a later date determined by the board before any person or group becomes an Acquiring Person) after a person or group begins\na tender or exchange offer (except if such person or group has become an Acquiring Person pursuant to an offer approved by a majority of the board) which, if completed,\nwould result in that person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. The earlier of such dates, upon which the Rights become exercisable, is referred to as the “Issuance Date”.\nIf a shareholder’s beneficial ownership of the then-outstanding ordinary shares as of the time of the public announcement of the rights plan was at or above 15%\n(including through entry into certain derivative positions), that shareholder’s (or group of shareholders’) then-existing ownership percentage was to be grandfathered and would\nnot trigger the exercisability of the Rights, as that shareholder was not deemed to be an Acquiring Person. However, the Rights would become exercisable (and any such\nshareholder will be deemed to be an Acquiring Person) if at any time after such announcement, that shareholder increases its ownership percentage to an amount equal to or\ngreater than the greater of (1) 15% and (2) the sum of (I) the lowest number of ordinary shares beneficially owned by such shareholder as a percentage of the outstanding\nordinary shares as of any time from and after the time of the public announcement of the declaration of the Rights and (II) 0.001%.\nUntil the Issuance Date, the balances in the book-entry accounting system of the transfer agent for our ordinary shares or, in the case of certificated shares, ordinary\nshares certificates, also evidenced the Rights, and any transfer of ordinary shares or, in the case of certificated shares, certificates for ordinary shares, constituted a transfer of\nRights. After that date, the Rights separated from the ordinary shares and are evidenced solely by Rights certificates that were mailed to all eligible holders of ordinary shares.\nAny Rights held by an Acquiring Person or any associate or affiliate thereof are void and may not be exercised.\nIn addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of ordinary shares following the Issuance Date and prior to the redemption, exchange, or expiration of the Rights,\nwe (a) shall, with respect to ordinary shares so issued or sold pursuant to the exercise of share options or pursuant to any other award or right under any employee benefit plan\nor arrangement, granted or awarded as of the Issuance Date (including, for example, upon the vesting and settlement of our outstanding Restricted Share Units or purchase of\nordinary shares under our 2021 Employee Share Purchase Plan), or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of securities hereinafter issued by us (except as may otherwise be\nprovided in the instrument(s) governing such securities), and (b) may, in any other case, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the board, issue Rights certificates representing\nthe appropriate number of Rights in connection with such issuance or sale; provided, however, that (i) no such Rights certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, we\nshall be advised by counsel that such issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax consequences to our company or the person to whom such Rights\ncertificate would be issued, and (ii) no such Rights certificate shall be issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the\nissuance thereof.\nFlip-In/Flip-Over\n8\nIf a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, then beginning on the Issuance Date, all holders of Rights except the Acquiring Person or any associate or affiliate\nthereof may, for a purchase price of $0.01 per one ordinary share, purchase one (1) ordinary share.\nIf our company is later acquired in a merger or similar transaction after the Issuance Date, all holders of Rights except the Acquiring Person or any associate or affiliate\nthereof may, for a purchase price of $0.01 per share, purchase one (1) times the number of shares of the acquiring corporation that each shareholder of our company is entitled\nto receive for each ordinary share held.\nScope of “Acquiring Person” Definition\nAn “Acquiring Person” is any person or entity who or which, together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, shall be the beneficial owner of 15% or\nmore of our ordinary shares then outstanding, but shall not include our company, any subsidiary of our company, any employee benefit or share ownership plan of our company\nor any subsidiary of our company, or any entity holding ordinary shares for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person or entity shall\nbecome an “Acquiring Person” as the result of an acquisition of ordinary shares by our company which, by reducing the number of ordinary shares outstanding, increases the\nproportionate number of ordinary shares beneficially owned by such person or entity to 15% or more of the ordinary shares then outstanding; provided, however, that, if a\nperson or entity shall become the beneficial owner of 15% or more of the ordinary shares then outstanding by reason of share purchases by our company and shall, after such\nshare purchases by our company, become the beneficial owner of any additional ordinary shares of our company, then such person or entity shall be deemed to be an\n“Acquiring Person.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, if our board determines in good faith that a person or entity that would otherwise be an “Acquiring Person” has become\nsuch inadvertently, and such person or entity divests as promptly as practicable a sufficient number of ordinary shares, so that such person or entity would no longer be an\n“Acquiring Person,” as defined pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, then such person or entity shall not be deemed to be an “Acquiring Person” for any\npurposes of the rights agreement. The definition of Acquiring Person is furthermore subject to the “grandfathering” scenarios described under “Exercise Period; Rights\nCertificates” above.\nExchange\nOur board of directors may, at its option, at any time after any person or entity becomes an Acquiring Person, exchange all or part of the then outstanding and\nexercisable Rights (except for Rights that have become void) for ordinary shares at an exchange ratio of one ordinary share per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any\nadjustment in the number of Rights. However, the board will not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after any person or entity (other than our company, any\nsubsidiary of our company, any employee benefit or stock ownership plan of our company or any such subsidiary, or any entity holding ordinary shares for or pursuant to the\nterms of any such plan), together with all affiliates and associates of such person or entity, becomes the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the ordinary shares then\noutstanding.\nImmediately upon the action of the board ordering the foregoing exchange, the right to exercise the Rights that are to be exchanged will terminate and the only right\nthereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of ordinary shares equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the exchange ratio.\nIn the event that there shall not be sufficient ordinary shares issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit any exchange of Rights, we will take all such action\nas may be necessary to authorize additional ordinary shares for issuance upon exchange of the Rights.\nSpecial Tender Offer\nIn connection with a special tender offer that is made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Law, the board will consider the requirements of Section 330\nof the Companies Law.\nAnti-Dilution Provisions\nOur board may adjust the purchase price of ordinary shares under each Right, the number of ordinary shares issuable under each Right, and the number of outstanding\nRights to prevent dilution that may occur from a share dividend, a share split, or a reclassification of the ordinary shares. No adjustments of less than 1% will be made to the\npurchase price under the Rights.\nAmendments\n9\nThe terms of the rights agreement may be amended by our board without the consent of the holders of the Rights. After a person or group becomes an Acquiring\nPerson, our board may not amend the rights agreement in a way that adversely affects holders of the Rights.\nRedemption\nThe board may, at its option, at any time prior to such time that any person or entity becomes an Acquiring Person, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding\nRights. The redemption of the Rights by the board may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the board, in its sole discretion, may establish\n(the effective date of redemption is referred to as the Redemption Date). Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the board ordering the redemption of the Rights,\nand without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate.\nExpiration\nThe Rights will expire on July 24, 2023 (which we refer to as the Expiration Date).\n10\nEXHIBIT 8.1\nSubsidiaries\nJURISDICTION OF\nINCORPORATION\nOR ORGANIZATION\nENTITY\nStratasys Solutions Ltd.

Persons Subject to Policy\nThis Policy shall apply to and be binding and enforceable upon current and former Officers. In addition, the Committee and the Board may apply this\nPolicy to persons who are not Officers, and such application shall apply in the manner determined by the Committee and the Board in their sole discretion.\n2. Compensation Subject to Policy\nThis Policy shall apply to Incentive-Based Compensation received on or after the Effective Date. For purposes of this Policy, the date on which\nIncentive-Based Compensation is “received” shall be determined under the Applicable Rules, which generally provide that Incentive-Based Compensation is\n“received” in the Company’s fiscal period during which the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is attained or satisfied, without regard to whether the grant,\nvesting or payment of the Incentive-Based Compensation occurs after the end of that period.\n3. Recovery of Compensation\nIn the event that the Company is required to prepare a Restatement, the Company shall recover, reasonably promptly and in accordance with Section 4\nbelow, the portion of any Incentive-Based Compensation that is Erroneously Awarded Compensation, unless the Committee and the Board have determined that\nrecovery from the relevant current or former Officer would be Impracticable. Recovery shall be required in accordance with the preceding sentence regardless\nof whether the applicable Officer engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for the Restatement and regardless of whether or\nwhen restated financial statements are filed by the Company. For clarity, the recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation under this Policy will not give\nrise to any Officer’s right to voluntarily terminate employment for “good reason” or due to a “constructive termination” (or any similar term of like effect)\nunder any plan, program or policy of or agreement with the Company or any of its affiliates.\n4. Manner of Recovery; Limitation on Duplicative Recovery\nThe Committee and the Board shall, in their sole discretion, determine the manner of recovery of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation, which may\ninclude, without limitation, reduction or cancellation by the Company or an affiliate of the Company of Incentive-Based Compensation or Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation, reimbursement or repayment by any person subject to this Policy, and, to the extent permitted by law, an offset of the Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation against other compensation payable by the Company or an affiliate of the Company to such person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless\notherwise prohibited by the Applicable Rules, to the extent this Policy provides for recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation already recovered by the\nCompany pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or Other Recovery Arrangements, the amount of Erroneously Awarded Compensation\nalready recovered by the Company from the recipient of such Erroneously Awarded Compensation may be credited to the amount of Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation required to be recovered pursuant to this Policy from such person.\n1\n5. Administration\nThis Policy shall be administered, interpreted and construed by the Committee, which is authorized to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or\nadvisable for such purpose. The Board may re-vest in itself the authority to administer, interpret and construe this Policy in accordance with applicable law, and\nin such event references herein to the “Committee” shall be deemed to be references to the Board. Subject to any permitted review by the applicable national\nsecurities exchange or association pursuant to the Applicable Rules, all determinations and decisions made by the Committee pursuant to the provisions of this\nPolicy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company and its affiliates, shareholders and employees. The Committee may delegate\nadministrative duties with respect to this Policy to one or more directors or employees of the Company, as permitted under applicable law, including any\nApplicable Rules.\n6. Interpretation\nThis Policy shall be interpreted and applied in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Applicable Rules, and to the extent this Policy is\ninconsistent with such Applicable Rules, it shall be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to ensure compliance therewith.\n7. No Indemnification; No Liability\nThe Company shall not indemnify or insure any person against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Policy, nor shall the\nCompany directly or indirectly pay or reimburse any person for any premiums for third-party insurance policies that such person may elect to purchase to fund\nsuch person’s potential obligations under this Policy. None of the Company, an affiliate of the Company or any member of the Committee or the Board shall\nhave any liability to any person as a result of actions taken under this Policy.\n8. Application; Enforceability\nExcept as otherwise determined by the Committee or the Board, the adoption of this Policy does not limit, and is intended to apply in addition to, any\nOther Recovery Arrangements. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event of a conflict between this Policy and the Compensation Policy, the latter shall\nprevail, except with respect to the recovery of any portion of Incentive-Based Compensation that is Erroneously Awarded Compensation that would not be\nrecoverable under the Compensation Policy, in which case this Policy shall prevail. Subject to Section 4, the remedy specified in this Policy shall not be\nexclusive and shall be in addition to every other right or remedy at law or in equity that may be available to the Company or an affiliate of the Company or is\notherwise required by applicable law and regulations.\n9. Severability\nThe provisions in this Policy are intended to be applied to the fullest extent of the law; provided, however, to the extent that any provision of this Policy\nis found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such provision will be applied to the maximum extent permitted, and shall automatically be\ndeemed amended in a manner consistent with its objectives to the extent necessary to conform to any limitations required under applicable law.\n10. Amendment and Termination\nThe Board or the Committee may amend, modify or terminate this Policy in whole or in part at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion.\nThis Policy will terminate automatically when the Company does not have a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or association in the U.S.\n2\n11.
