(Nasdaq: LMB) (“Limbach” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**2024 Third Quarter Financial Overview Compared to 2023 Third Quarter**\n\n  * Owner Direct Relationships (“ODR”) revenue increased 41.3%, or $27.2 million, to $93.0 million accounting for 69.4% of total revenue. \n  * Total revenue was $133.9 million, an increase of 4.8% from $127.8 million. \n  * Total gross profit was $36.1 million, an increase of 15.6% from $31.2 million. \n  * ODR gross profit accounted for $29.6 million, or 82.1%, of total gross profit. \n  * Net income of $7.5 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.2 million, or $0.61 per diluted share. \n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $17.3 million, up 27.2% from $13.6 million. \n  * Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 million compared to $17.2 million. \n\n\n\n**Management Comments**\n\n“In the third quarter, we continued to execute the three pillars of our strategy with each pillar contributing to our EBITDA growth and gross margin expansion,” said Michael McCann, President and Chief Executive Officer of Limbach Holdings. “Our results are a direct outcome of executing our plan to shift our business to working directly for building owners on existing facilities, evolving our service offerings and scaling through acquisitions. \n\n“We are seeing durable customer demand for our value-added solutions and achieving organic growth by focusing on deeper penetration with existing customers. Demand in all verticals has been strong, and we believe the long-term growth potential of data centers is set to play an increasingly important role for demand. \n\n“Our recent acquisition of Kent Island Mechanical increased market share within the Greater Washington, D.C. metro region. We immediately began integrating Kent Island on to the Limbach platform to expand our capabilities, gain efficiencies and add new customers to our existing ODR business. We’re pleased with the initial progress and anticipate making additional acquisitions at a pace of about two to three per year from our strong pipeline of potential targets. \n\n“We are quickly approaching our ODR and GCR target revenue mix of 65% to 70% ODR for 2024, and in 2025 we expect to see growth in our top line, total consolidated revenue.” \n\nThe following are results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023: \n\n  * Total revenue was $133.9 million, an increase of 4.8% from $127.8 million. ODR segment revenue of $93.0 million increased by $27.2 million, or 41.3%, while GCR revenue decreased by $21.0 million, or 33.9%. The increase in period-over-period ODR segment revenue was primarily due to the Company’s continued focus on accelerating the growth of its ODR business and as a result of the Industrial Air transaction. Industrial Air was not an acquired entity for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in period-over-period GCR segment revenue was primarily due to the Company’s continued focus on the execution of its mix-shift strategy to the ODR segment. \n\n\n  * Total gross profit was $36.1 million, compared to $31.2 million. ODR gross profit increased $10.4 million, or 53.8%, due to the combination of an increase in revenue and higher segment margins of 31.9% versus 29.3% driven by contract mix. GCR gross profit decreased $5.5 million, or 46.0%, primarily due to lower revenue and lower margins of 15.8% compared to 19.3% in the prior period. The total gross profit percentage increased from 24.5% to 27.0%, mainly driven by the mix of higher margin ODR segment work, the Company continuing to being more selective when pursuing GCR work, and the Industrial Air transaction. \n\n\n  * Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased by approximately $2.8 million, to $23.7 million, compared to $21.0 million. The increase in SG&A expense was primarily due to $1.0 million of SG&A expenses incurred within the Industrial Air entity that was not an acquired entity of the Company during the three months ended September 30, 2023, a $1.1 million increase in payroll related expenses, a $0.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expenses and a $0.4 million increase in professional services fees. As a percent of revenue, SG&A expenses were 17.7%, up from 16.4% in the prior period. \n\n\n  * Interest expense was relatively flat at $0.5 million during the current quarter compared to $0.4 million. \n\n\n  * Interest income was $0.6 million during the current quarter compared to $0.4 million. This increase was due to the Company’s timing and amounts of investments in overnight repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and money market funds period-over-period. \n\n\n  * Net income was $7.5 million compared to $7.2 million, an increase of 4.1%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.62 as compared to $0.61 in the prior period. Adjusted EBITDA was $17.3 million compared to $13.6 million in the prior period, an increase of 27.2%. \n\n\n  * Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 million compared to $17.2 million in the prior period primarily due to changes in working capital. \n\n\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAt September 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents were $51.2 million. Current assets were $217.1 million and current liabilities were $138.2 million at September 30, 2024, representing a current ratio of 1.57x compared to 1.50x at December 31, 2023. Working capital was $78.9 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $7.1 million from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 million in borrowings against our revolving credit facility and $4.3 million for standby letters of credit. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\nWe are updating our guidance for FY 2024 as follows: \n\n**Current** |  **Previous**  \n---|---  \n**_Revenue_** |  $520 million – $540 million  |  $515 million – $535 million   \n**_Adjusted EBITDA_** |  $60 million – $63 million  |  $55 million – $58 million   \n  \nWith respect to projected 2024 Adjusted EBITDA guidance and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a quantitative reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts due to the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to certain items, which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on future financial results. \n\n**Conference Call Details**\n\nDate:  |  Wednesday, November 6, 2024   \n---|---  \nTime:  |  9:00 a.m. Eastern Time   \nParticipant Dial-In Numbers:   \nDomestic callers:  |  (877) 407-6176   \nInternational callers:  |  +1 (201) 689-8451   \n  \n**Access by Webcast**\n\nThe call will also be simultaneously webcast over the Internet via the “Investor Relations” section of Limbach’s website at [www.limbachinc.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.limbachinc.com&esheet=54147522&newsitemid=20241105655435&lan=en-US&anchor=www.limbachinc.com&index=1&md5=3936d4b86405d96632668e38e91f9b2a) or by clicking on the conference call link: [https://event.choruscall.com/mediaframe/webcast.html?webcastid=O8Y8RPcV](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DO8Y8RPcV&esheet=54147522&newsitemid=20241105655435&lan=en-US&anchor=https%3A%2F%2Fevent.choruscall.com%2Fmediaframe%2Fwebcast.html%3Fwebcastid%3DO8Y8RPcV&index=2&md5=2b8b3d3cafc9dd520ede67d9a23be7ce).

performance of our business, management utilizes a variety of financial and performance measures. The key measures are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, and taxes, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of, when applicable, other non-cash items or expenses that are unusual or non-recurring that we believe do not reflect our core operating results. We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance for the current period and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. We understand that these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. When assessing our operating performance, investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, the results presented by Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure excludes. A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, the most comparable GAAP measure, is provided below. \n\nWe refer to our estimated revenue on uncompleted contracts, including the amount of revenue on contracts for which work has not begun, less the revenue we have recognized under such contracts, as “backlog.” Backlog includes unexercised contract options. \n\nReconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended** **September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended** **September 30,**  \n**_(in thousands)_** |  **2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nNet income  |  $  |  7,484  |  $  |  7,192  |  $  |  21,033  |  $  |  15,505   \nAdjustments:   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  2,741  |  1,892  |  8,261  |  5,751   \nInterest expense  |  468  |  437  |  1,375  |  1,615   \nInterest income  |  (626  |  )  |  (377  |  )  |  (1,734  |  )  |  (624  |  )   \nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense  |  1,603  |  1,140  |  4,323  |  3,374   \nLoss on early debt extinguishment  |  –  |  –  |  –  |  311   \nChange in fair value of interest rate swap  |  267  |  (116  |  )  |  130  |  (153  |  )   \nCEO transition costs  |  –  |  –  |  –  |  958   \nIncome tax provision  |  3,394  |  2,760  |  5,462  |  5,407   \nAcquisition and other transaction costs  |  826  |  225  |  877  |  524   \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration  |  610  |  161  |  2,344  |  464   \nRestructuring costs(1) |  565  |  317  |  827  |  1,089   \nAdjusted EBITDA  |  $  |  17,332  |  $  |  13,631  |  $  |  42,898  |  $  |  34,221   \nRevenue  |  $  |  133,920  |  $  |  127,768  |  $  |  375,131  |  $  |  373,659   \nAdjusted EBITDA Margin  |  12.9  |  %  |  10.7  |  %  |  11.4  |  %  |  9.2  |  %   \n(1) |  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the majority of the restructuring costs related to our Southern California and Eastern Pennsylvania branches.   \n---|---  \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241105655435/en/>\n\n**Investor Relations** Financial Profiles, Inc.

The key measure is Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus depreciation and amortization expense,\ninterest expense (net), and taxes, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of, when applicable, other non-cash items or expenses that are unusual or non-recurring or that we believe do not reflect our core operating results. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to our investors to\nenhance their understanding of our financial performance for the current period and our ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes, capital expenditures and debt service. We understand that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other\ninterested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, however, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. When\nassessing our operating performance, investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) calculated in accordance with GAAP. Further, the results presented by Adjusted EBITDA cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure\nexcludes.
