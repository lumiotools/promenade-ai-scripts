We continue to advance our clinical and pre-clinical candidates, while leveraging our robust enLIGHTENTM Discovery Platform to identify new and innovative assets that may be impactful in cancer immunotherapy,” said Paul Peter Tak, MD, PhD, FMedSci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Candel. “We are encouraged by the first clinical and biomarker activity data after repeated injection of CAN-3110 from our ongoing phase 1b clinical trial of CAN-3110 in recurrent high-grade glioma, which suggests a long tail of survival. We are also excited about the data that supports potential expansion of CAN-3110 from recurrent high-grade glioma into melanoma, where we observed antitumor activity in pre-clinical models.”\n\nDr. Tak continued, “As to the future, we are also looking forward to reporting updated overall survival data from both our ongoing CAN-2409 phase 2 NSCLC and pancreatic cancer clinical trials in Q1 2025.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 & Recent Highlights**\n\n  * _CAN-3110 – Recurrent High-Grade Glioma_\n    * Received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for CAN-3110 for the treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG).\n    * Presented a Trial-in-Progress poster at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting on the ongoing phase 1b clinical trial exploring multiple doses of CAN-3110 in patients with rHGG.\n    * Presented clinical and biomarker activity data from the ongoing phase 1b clinical trial at the 16th Annual International Oncolytic Virotherapy Conference (IOVC).\n    * In the oral presentation, the investigators reported ongoing improved survival compared to historical controls, with 3 out of 6 patients still alive after more than one year (12.2, 13.0, and 18.7 months, respectively) after initiation of experimental treatment with repeated CAN-3110 injections.\n    * The data also show discrepancies between imaging and histologic findings, suggesting radiologic pseudo-progression: there was a near absence of tumor cells alongside dense lymphocyte infiltrates in biopsies obtained after CAN-3110 administration, especially in patients with enhancement on post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.\n  * _CAN-3110 – Melanoma_\n    * Presented preclinical results on the therapeutic potential of CAN-3110 in the Ras-Raf pathway altered melanoma model at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s 39th Annual Meeting.\n    * CAN-3110 exhibited potent, tumor-specific cytotoxicity in human and murine melanoma cell lines with varied CDKN2A pathway alterations and Nestin expression. _In vivo_ mouse studies showed dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth, with regression observed in a subset (3 of 8) of tumors treated with a high dose of CAN-3110.\n    * Cytotoxic activity in melanoma-bearing mice was associated with systemic immune activation, including increased activation and proliferation of circulating T cells.\n    * Findings mirror those from rHGG patients treated with CAN-3110 reported last year in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06623-2). The therapy was well-tolerated in preclinical models based on body weight and histopathological analysis following intratumoral administration.\n  * _enLIGHTEN_ _™_ _Discovery Platform_\n    * Presented poster titled “A first-in-class multimodal immunotherapy for enhanced immune activation in the tumor microenvironment as a novel therapeutic strategy for solid tumors” at IOVC.\n    * The presentation focused on the latest asset from the enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform, a multimodal viral therapeutic candidate encoding IL-12 and IL-15. Data showed the ability of the asset to induce expansion and activation of natural killer and CD8+ T cell populations, resulting in significant tumor growth inhibition and regression in two different models.\n\n\n\n**Anticipated Milestones**\n\n  * Phase 2b topline data for CAN-2409 in _low-to-intermediate-risk_ , localized, non-metastatic prostate cancer expected in Q4 2024.\n  * Phase 3 topline disease-free survival data for CAN-2409 in localized _intermediate/high-risk_ prostate cancer expected in Q4 2024.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results for Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2024**\n\n**Research** **and** **Development Expenses:** Research and development expenses were $5.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $5.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses following the corporate restructuring in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a decrease in depreciation, impairment, and loss on the sale of fixed assets. These decreases were partially offset by clinical development costs driven by increased manufacturing costs for CAN-2409 programs. Research and development expenses included non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.6 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.3 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**General** **and** **Administrative** **Expenses:** General and administrative expenses were $3.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $3.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased professional and consulting fees. The increase was partially offset by lower insurance costs. General and administrative expenses included non-cash stock compensation expense of $0.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2023.\n\n**Net** **Loss:** Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.6 million, compared to a net loss of $8.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, and included other expense, net of $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2024 and other income, net of $0.4 million for the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the change in the fair value of the Company’s warrant liability.\n\n**Cash** **Position:** Cash and cash equivalents, as of September 30, 2024, were $16.6 million, as compared to $35.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Based on current plans and assumptions, the Company expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its current operating plan to the end of the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**About Candel Therapeutics**\n\nCandel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing off-the-shelf multimodal biological immunotherapies that elicit an individualized, systemic anti-tumor immune response to help patients fight cancer.

The data will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting, taking place November 6-10, in Houston, Texas by Anne R. Diers, PhD, Senior Director of Research at Candel Therapeutics.\n\nCAN-3110 is a first-in-class, replication-competent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) oncolytic viral immunotherapy candidate designed with dual activity for oncolysis and immune activation. CAN-3110 activity is conditional to the expression of Nestin in cancer cells and specific genetic alterations such as loss of the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2A.\n\nThe poster, titled “Therapeutic potential of CAN-3110 in Ras-Raf pathway altered melanoma,” will focus on new data demonstrating the mechanism of action and antitumor activity of CAN-3110 in preclinical models of melanoma, a tumor characterized by high Nestin expression, frequent loss-of-function in CDKN2A, and additional alterations in the Ras-Raf signaling pathway.\n\n“Melanoma exhibits numerous genetic alterations in common with high-grade glioma, a tumor type for which CAN-3110 treatment has consistently shown promising biological and clinical activity,” said Francesca Barone, MD, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Candel. “The presence of this genetic profile, and in particular the high expression of Nestin, positions CAN-3110 as a potential first-in-class viral immunotherapy in this new indication. This hypothesis is supported by data showing marked anti-tumor activity in models of melanoma.”\n\nData presented at SITC showed potent monotherapy, anti-tumor activity of CAN-3110 in both _in vitro_ human cell lines and _in vivo_ murine models of melanoma. _In vivo_ , CAN-3110 exhibited tumor-specific cytotoxicity with dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and tumor regression observed in a subset of tumors treated with a high dose of CAN-3110. Cytotoxic activity in melanoma-bearing mice was associated with systemic immune activation and increased proliferation of circulating T cells, mirroring the effect observed in patients with high-grade glioma treated with CAN-3110, as reported last year in [_Nature_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kSnsmdkWmLBR--CftWnc67iwc5v-giLTeTAI-0mKBF5rSS55ehFuSepitwF3qjEajSNtvRF4ynGx1w62L_oljfo0Z45xxDpmYCvRDhNM2l4=). CAN-3110 was well-tolerated in mice based on body weight and histopathological analysis following intratumoral administration.\n\n“These encouraging preclinical results validate the broader potential of CAN-3110 in treating a variety of Nestin-positive solid tumors” said Paul Peter Tak, MD, PhD, FMedSci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Candel. “The data supports the ability of CAN-3110 to selectively target and kill Nestin-positive tumor cells while eliciting profound immune activation. We are excited by the possibility to develop a new pipeline in a product centered around this first-in-class experimental medicine”.\n\nFor more information about the presented data, please visit the Candel website at: [https://www.candeltx.com/media/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1KuOTe8iNt3QgE1MGcVlT0Ez8u7xD7kyBhFtlgSiSrPrARdLxw1QEEdthRsZsYneYHSPoFNvZdxqdVI9nInhFeiQenZTlIaugYwYmt26s9jrjB4dvIQaYEQKOE7Aq8-N)\n\n**About CAN-3110**\n\nCAN-3110 is a first-in-class, replication-competent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) oncolytic viral immunotherapy candidate designed with dual activity for oncolysis and immune activation in a single therapeutic. CAN-3110 is being evaluated in a phase 1b clinical trial in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (rHGG). In October 2023, the Company announced that [ _Nature_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kSnsmdkWmLBR--CftWnc62InrvdAuGiUUMr1U9O4rBpRI22XXZDKXcWpOrxKAUgHRex6DRwOKCzb2Zt9-i0y3H91qQv_pWGc1DTXwd0qOYs=) published results from this ongoing clinical trial. CAN-3110 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting toxicity reported. In the clinical trial, the investigators observed improved median overall survival compared to historical controls after a single CAN-3110 injection in this therapy-resistant condition.1 The Company and academic collaborators are currently evaluating the effects of multiple CAN-3110 injections in rHGG, supported by the Break Through Cancer foundation. CAN-3110 has previously received U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of rHGG.\n\n**About Candel Therapeutics**\n\nCandel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing off-the-shelf multimodal biological immunotherapies that elicit an individualized, systemic anti-tumor immune response to help patients fight cancer. Candel has established two clinical stage multimodal biological immunotherapy platforms based on novel, genetically modified adenovirus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) gene constructs, respectively. CAN-2409 is the lead product candidate from the adenovirus platform and is currently in ongoing clinical trials in non-small cell lung cancer (phase 2), borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (phase 2), and localized, non-metastatic prostate cancer (phase 2b and phase 3). CAN-3110 is the lead product candidate from the HSV platform and is currently in an ongoing investigator-sponsored phase 1b clinical trial in rHGG. Finally, Candel’s enLIGHTEN™ Discovery Platform is a systematic, iterative HSV-based discovery platform leveraging human biology and advanced analytics to create new viral immunotherapies for solid tumors.\n\nFor more information about Candel, visit: [www.candeltx.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=ibf3J5hpOGoJghKuxEa1lrSJmzz4zHJFJDOhsTd5sbrn3blUnI-hEa5BWym3A5LZDw47OqYdj2eQMs_2Nqy3Tw==)\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release includes certain disclosures that contain “forward-looking statements,” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including, without limitation, express or implied statements regarding the timing and advancement of current and future development programs, including key data readout milestones and presentations; expectations regarding early biological readouts as predictor of clinical response; expectations regarding the therapeutic benefit of the Company’s programs, including the ability of CAN-3110 to treat high-grade glioma, melanoma or other Nestin-expressing solid tumors; and expectations regarding the potential benefits conferred by orphan drug designation and fast track designation.
