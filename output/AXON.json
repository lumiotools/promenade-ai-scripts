We are thrilled to announce\nthe closing of our acquisition of Dedrone, bringing integrated\nairspace security technology — including comprehensive\nprotection, detection, identification and mitigation of\nunauthorized drones in restricted airspace — into the\nAxon DFR solution.\nAlong with Dedrone, Axon’s DFR offering has continued to\nadvance through our unmatched partnerships with Skydio and\nDroneSense. Together, our DFR solution includes U.S.-made\ndrone hardware and a newly introduced autonomous docking\nsolution from Skydio, enabling fully remote-controlled launches,\nlandings, recharging and airspace deconfliction for beyond\nvisual line of sight (BVLOS) operations. In addition, our DFR\nsolution integrates into Fusus, which provides unified situational\nawareness by allowing agencies to monitor live drone feeds,\nshare footage and streamline coordinated responses.\nThis combination positions us as the leader in powering\nscalable, end-to-end DFR operations.\nThe differentiated capabilities of our DFR offering are\nevidenced by the Campbell Police Department in California\nrecently receiving a first-of-its-kind waiver from the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) for BVLOS operations as part of\nits DFR program. Their approval includes nighttime operations,\nenabling 24/7 drone use, and allows the department to fly\nmissions without the need for visual observers. We are excited\nto enable this ground-breaking advancement in DFR operations\n“This FAA approval is a major\nas we continue to invest in this market opportunity.\nmilestone for our department and our\ncommunity.

Helping our\ncustomers achieve better outcomes is at the center of\neverything we do. This is especially true in times of crisis.\nWhen hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated communities\nacross the Southeast U.S., thousands were left grappling with\nextensive damage.

Refer to “Statistical Definitions” below.\nQ3\n2024\nLetter\nto\nShareholders\nAxon\nEnterprise,\nInc.\nNASDAQ\n:\nAXON\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Axon’s expectations as of November 7, 2024, and are subject to risks\nand uncertainties. Please refer to “Forward-looking Statements” below for more information.\nQ4 2024\n→ For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue within the range of $560 million to $570 million, representing greater than\n30% annual growth at the midpoint.\n→ * We expect Adjusted EBITDA within the range of $130 million to $135 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA margin\nof approximately 23.5%.\n• We provide Adjusted EBITDA guidance, rather than net income guidance, due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain\ntypes of expenses and gains such as stock-based compensation, income tax expenses and gains or losses on marketable\nsecurities and strategic investments, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA. We are unable to reasonably estimate\nthe impact of such expenses, which could be material, on net income. Accordingly, we do not provide a reconciliation\nof projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA.\nFULL YEAR\n→ Axon’s full year 2024 revenue expectation has improved to approximately $2.07 billion, representing greater than 32%\nannual growth. This is an increase from our prior revenue guidance range of $2.00 billion to $2.05 billion, or 29.5%\nannual growth at the midpoint.\n→ Axon expects full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA dollars of approximately $510 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA margin\nof approximately 24.6%. This is an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $460 million to $475 million,\nwhich implied Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 23.1%\n→ We expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $360 million to $380 million, up from $355 million\nto $370 million previously. Because our stock-based compensation expense may vary based on changes in our stock price\nor the actual timing of attainment of certain metrics, it is inherently difficult to forecast future stock-based compensation expense.\n• Full year stock-based compensation expense includes approximately $210 million for broad-based equity compensation\nprograms and a one-time enhanced equity compensation program provided to employees whose compensation is under a\nspecific threshold. Approximately $170 million in full year expected stock-based compensation expense, primarily in SG&A\nand R&D, is related to the broad-based 2024 eXponential Stock Plan and the 2024 CEO Performance Award approved by\nour shareholders in May 2024. These performance-based incentive programs are achieved through stock price, operational\nand time-based requirements and are divided into seven substantially equal tranches. As of September 30, 2024, we have\nrecognized expenses related to some tranches where we currently deem achievement to be probable. Approximately\n$43 million in expense, primarily in COGS, is related to a one-time enhanced equity compensation program provided to\nemployees whose compensation is under a specified threshold.\n→ We expect 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $80 million to $95 million, unchanged from prior quarters. Our 2024 CapEx plans\ninclude investments in TASER 10 automation and capacity expansion, including cartridge capacity, global facility build-out\nand upgrades, such as warehousing support for global shipping facilities.\n11\nQ3\n2024\nLetter\nto\nShareholders\nAxon\nEnterprise,\nInc.\nNASDAQ\n:\nAXON\n2024 outlook\nThank you for investing QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST\nThursday, November 7, 2024 / 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET\nin our mission.\nIR WEBSITE investor.axon.com\n— The Axon Team ZOOM LINK axon.zoom.us/j/98297372356\nStatistical\ndefinitions\nANNUAL RECURRING REVENUE\nAnnual recurring revenue is a performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our\nrevenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue\nand deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or\ndeferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not\nintended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue. We calculate annual recurring revenue as monthly\nrecurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue, annualized.\nNET REVENUE RETENTION\nDollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing\ncustomers. We calculate it as the software, camera and TASER warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of\nagency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription and warranty revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by\nthe software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This\ncalculation includes high-margin warranty revenue but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription component of the\ncustomer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are\nbuilding. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago\nquarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated\nduring the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for\nthe effect of phased deployments — meaning that, for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied\nmonthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to\nthe customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies,\nplease reference our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nTOTAL COMPANY FUTURE CONTRACTED REVENUE\nTotal company future contracted revenue represents remaining performance obligations and includes both recognized contract\nliabilities as well as amounts that are expected to be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance\nobligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606\nas of September 30, 2024. We currently expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months, and\ngenerally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments,\nbudget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.\n12\nQ3\n2024\nLetter\nto\nShareholders\nAxon\nEnterprise,\nInc.\nNASDAQ\n:\nAXON\nNon-GAAP\nmeasures\nTo supplement the Company's financial results presented in Free cash flow (most comparable GAAP measure: cash flow\naccordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial from operating activities) – Cash flows provided by operating\nmeasures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, activities minus purchases of property and equipment and\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP intangible assets.\nDiluted Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free\nCash Flow.

I hope we've all had a chance to\nread our shareholder letter released after the market closed, which you can find @investor.axon.com.\nOur prepared remarks today are meant to build upon the information in that letter. During this call, we'll\ndiscuss our business outlook and make forward looking statements. Any forward looking statements\nmade today are pursuant to and within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private\nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Now turning to our quarterly update. First we'll start off with a quick video showing you an\nawesome example of one of our customers using products across our ecosystem. It'll be about five\nminutes, so you get a chance to take a minute.\n>> Quarterly Earnings Video << https://vimeo.com/1012893915?share=copy\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAlright, thanks Erik, and I want to thank all of you. I thank all of our shareholders for joining us here\ntoday. So welcome to Axon's third quarter 2024 earnings call. It is truly humbling to come back to you\nwith another fantastic update and to show you these videos that capture what we've been working on\nand the relationships we strive to build with our customers. These calls are a great opportunity for us to\nreflect on our recent momentum while thinking about what's next. As I've shared with you in the past, I\nspend the majority of my time with our customers and with our product teams, ensuring that we are\ninventing and focused on the right things and aligning our efforts where our customers need us and\nwhere they need us to be for their future. I've been able to lean in with hundreds of our customers over\nthe past few months between the AUSA, which is the big Army show, IACP, the Chiefs of Police\nConference, and several events at our offices and internationally.\nOur customers are as excited as we are about what's ahead, and it's energizing to see them ready to\nmove forward with us on this journey together. There's no place where this is more clear to me than the\narea of artificial intelligence. The interest is immense here, and we are already building a suite of\nproducts for our new AI era plan, providing access to an expanding set of solutions. Our strategy here is\ntwofold. First, we understand and believe that AI innovation is moving at a breakneck pace. It would be\nalmost impossible for us to continually update our go-to-market offerings at the speed that AI is moving.\nWith this plan, we get to deliver an ever-changing and expanding offering that drives increased value for\nour customers over time. Second, we want to partner with our customers by offering them access to the\nsolutions we have today and those we are building for the future.\nWe can work together on this adapting to deliver what they need. As technology improves and evolves,\nwe know the best way to win is by putting our customers first. This is going to be how we help them\n3\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nharness the power of AI as we launch many exciting products over the coming years. AI is one of the\nmany areas that excite me about our business, but it's not the only one. Taser 10, combined with the\npower of expanding virtual reality or VR training portfolio continues to gain traction as a disruptive force\nto how we deescalate in difficult situations. Real-time capabilities enabled with Axon Body 4 and Fusus\nhave advanced response and communication in ways that are finally modernizing public safety\ncommunication tools that have been a bit stagnant for decades. And our momentum in newer\ncategories like drones and robotics, continues to accelerate with our recently closed acquisition of\nDedrone, which helped enable Campbell PD, as you saw, to gain the first FAA approval waiver for 24/7\ndrone operations as first responder.\nTo summarize, I'm very excited about what we are seeing in the market today and the energy our\ncustomers have put behind what we are doing. We're on a multi-year journey to modernize the way\npublic safety operates, and the opportunity in front of us is to drive real improvement in outcomes that\nmatter to our communities and to our customers who work tirelessly every day to make the world safer.\nWhile we report our results to you on a quarterly basis, I believe our success is measured in years and\nlives saved. We remain focused on our moonshot goal and our mission to protect life, and we're\nthankful to have you on this journey with us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Josh Isner.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks a lot, Rick, and good afternoon, everybody. This week we are participating in a core element of\nour culture at Axon, putting our customers first together. It is the week of the customer internally where\nwe invite customers into work to share their stories, recognize our internal support teams, and double\ndown on employee in on employee training to ensure that the customer remains at the center of our\nuniverse. I'd like to share a quick anecdote to that end. In response to the devastating hurricanes that\nimpacted the Southeastern US in September and October, we deployed our Axon Aid emergency\nresponse team to work alongside first responders around the clock for 16 days, our team got to witness\nthe magnitude of customers efforts firsthand. At Axon, we know our customers are heroes, and being a\nsmall service to them in this mission was an honor and nothing short of inspirational.\nWe work every day to help our customers achieve better outcomes, and when we put their needs first,\nwe get to share in their successes. Understanding. This is something I have spent a lot of time on, and it\npercolates into how we've built our team. When I look at what our team is working on with our\ncustomers and the results we are delivering because of our strong partnership with them, I continue to\nbe excited and impressed. I'll briefly share a few updates that build my confidence. First, our record\nresults. We just delivered our 11th consecutive quarter, growing above 25%, and our third quarter this\nyear growing above 30%. That growth puts us at a level where we are accomplishing in quarters what\ntook us years to do only a few years ago. Second, while we've been growing fast, we still have line of\nsight to a multi-year growth opportunity that continues to build.\nWe close Q3 with record bookings in excess of $1 billion on both an absolute and normalized five-year\nbasis. That's our strongest normalized booking quarter in history outside of Q4 last year. As we move to\nclose out this Q4, which has historically been our strongest bookings quarter, we are already executing\nagainst the largest pipeline we've ever had, and we fully expect to post an exceptional and record result\nagain. Third, what's really encouraging here is that we are seeing strength across the board. Our state\nand local business is firing on all cylinders led by Jessica Duncan. In the early interest we are seeing in\nour AI error plan signals to me that this new offering could be one of the more meaningful drivers for us\n4\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nin the year to come beyond our state and local business. Our US federal bookings came in higher than\nwhat we did in a full year, just a few years ago, with four of our top 10 domestic deals in the quarter,\ncoming from federal customers across several agencies, including DHS, IRS and Amtrak.\nLooking ahead, we have a clear path to surpass the Q3 Federal bookings again in Q4 for our strongest\nyear yet. International bookings came in at near record levels matching Q4 of last year, up 40%\nsequentially from Q2, and our year-to-date international bookings are up 40% from last year. Similar to\nFederal, we see a clear path to surpass Q3 bookings again in Q4. Finally, we saw strong bookings from\nCorrections customers, our Justice segment continued to grow, and we have several Fortune 500\ncompanies conducting retail security trials with Axon products in the Enterprise segment. As is the case,\nevery Q4, we must do two things. Well number one, close out the year with maximum intensity and\nflawless execution. And number two, ensure that we are well prepared to drive a record 2025. We have\na lot of sharp, adaptable, and unstoppable teammates that are embracing this challenge. I know I say\nthis a lot, but I truly believe Axon is in the strongest position we've ever been. We have an immense\nopportunity ahead to grow our business and continue to progress toward our moonshot goal, which we\nwill pursue with vigor. Now, I'll pass it over to Brittany to go over everything in more detail. Brittany,\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc\nThank you, Josh. This quarter marks two years for me at Axon, and the business has certainly been\nincredible. I couldn't be more pleased to share the results of another great Q3. We grew revenue 32%\nyear over year and delivered strong adjusted EBITDA with a 26.7% margin. We achieved this margin\nexpansion while driving over 30% top line growth, and we continue to successfully prioritize balancing\nthe bottom line with achieving that strong top line growth that we promise. As Rick and Josh both talked\nabout, the focus on pro, the focus on product innovation and delivering for our customers remains our\nNorth star, and is what enables us to keep delivering these types of results. Thank you to everyone on\nour team who drives that focus. As we get into the details, I am particularly excited that the revenue\ngrowth is broad based in terms of products and customer verticals.\nJosh spoke to the strength we're seeing across different customers. The strength is across our products\nas well. For example, our acquisition of Fusus has been very positive across a number of our verticals,\nand Taser 10 also continues to exceed our expectations on its adoption. TASER revenue was a standout\nin the quarter, growing 36% year over year. The strongest growth in our TASER segment in more than\ntwo years on the back of increased capacity and broad-based demand cloud and services was up 36%\nyear over year with software revenue as the primary driver. ARR of 885 million is up 36% year over year.\nAnd our net revenue retention an indicator of growth with our existing and new customers increased to\n123% sensors and other revenue was up 18% year over year with strong demand for Axon Body 4\npartially offset by Fleet. Fleet continues to be a very strong product, but given RFP timing and customer\ndeployment schedules, we expect it to have inconsistent hardware revenue quarter to quarter.\nOverall, our future contracted revenue sits at approximately 7.7 billion exiting the quarter, which is up\n33% year over year. As a reminder, this is a gap definition of our remaining performance obligations and\nwill not tie exactly to commentary we share about bookings. Bookings are also seasonally strongest for\nus in Q3 and Q4, and as Josh shared, we're continuing to see that this year with a strong Q4 in front of\nus. Adjusted gross margin of 63.2% was stable sequentially and up approximately 50 basis points from\nlast year. Overall, as we have ramped automation and efficiency in our TASER 10 manufacturing, we\nhave stabilized our margins and expect to maintain these approximate levels. Subject to the usual\n5\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nbusiness mix dynamics, adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.7% was a three-year record driven by operating\nleverage as we delivered scale on strong revenue.\nOne note on our financials that you will see in our forthcoming 10 Q is that we have made a revision to\nour historical financials to reflect corrections of certain errors related to the categorization of some of\nour partner relationships as principle instead of as agent. We concluded that these were not material to\nany previously issued financial statements. Our current period reported financials and revised historical\nfinancials reflect revenue and expense recognition consistent with the corrections we made in the\nrevision. Now turning to our guidance, we are pleased to raise guidance again on both revenue and\nadjusted EBITDA. Our Q4 revenue guidance is a range of five 60 to 570 million, representing more than\n30% growth at the midpoint. This implies approximately 2.07 billion in full-year revenue, or greater than\n32% annual growth up from our prior guidance of two to 2.05 billion or 29.5% growth. Our adjusted\nEBITDA guidance for the fourth quarter is a range of 130 to 135 million, or approximately 23.5%\nadjusted EBITDA margin.\nThis implies full year adjusted EBITDA dollars of approximately 510 million or 24.6% margin. Note that\nQ4 implies lower adjusted EBITDA margins than we were just able to achieve in Q3, which is a result of\ntiming on some of our expenses and also reflects a full quarter of our now closed Dedrone acquisition\nand cost to integrate. We continue to have conviction in our margin target of 25% for 25, which\ncontinues to show nice leverage over full year 24. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress against\nthe three year targets we set out for 2025. We are on pace to deliver our initial 2 billion revenue target\nfor 2025, a full year early, and remain confident in our extended target of 20% or greater annual growth,\nall while increasing our adjusted EBITDA margins and achieving the 25% target next year. With that, I'd\nlike to turn the call over to take any questions.\nQUESTION AND ANSWER SEGMENT\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks, Brittany. We can all get up into gallery view. We'll take our first question from George Notter at\nJefferies. Hey, George.\nGeoge Notter Analyst, Jefferies\nHi guys. Thanks very much. Congratulations on the strong results. I wanted to ask some questions about,\nDraft One. I'm curious if you can give us an update on your progress in the September quarter there in\nterms of, pipeline, was there any revenue recognition tied to Draft One? you know, any significant\ncontributions to your ARR?\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSo, thanks a lot for the question. I really appreciate it. in terms of Draft One, yes, we did receive some\norders in Q3 from early customers so there was some impact on revenue from Draft One, but I would\nstill say we're in like the top of the first inning on what that's going to look like moving forward,\n6\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nespecially as we go into next year with draft rule one being the anchor product of our AI era bundle. And\nso, certainly we're very, very bullish on Draft One and all of our AI products contributions to both\nrevenue and profitability over time. But we're still not yet seeing a, a major impact on the quarter-to-\nquarter results, which is expected at due to the, you know, SaaS accounting\nGeoge Notter Analyst, Jefferies\nLast quarter, I think you guys mentioned a hundred, a hundred-million-dollar pipeline. I think in six or\nseven weeks of selling Draft One. Is there an update to that number?\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nIt continues to grow, especially after IACP, so we're again and we're converting some of that pipeline\ninto the new kind of AI era bundle that we're coming out with next year as well. And again, Draft One is\nreally the kind of central driver of interest in that bundle, along with a number of other AI features we're\ndeveloping right now. So, certainly safe to say that the interest is the most we've seen out of any year\none product.\nGeoge Notter Analyst, Jefferies\nGot it. One, one last follow up and I'll pass it on. Where are we going to land in terms of pricing on, on\nthat? You know, I realize it's going to go into the bundle. I know you guys have been selling it a la carte\nto some degree to early customers. You know, we had heard price points of 30 and $40 a month, but, is\nthat kind of the right zip code in terms of where this is priced or where, you know, maybe the\nincremental bundle would step up to, in terms of pricing? Any, any sense there?\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSure. so right now, Draft One alone is $65 a month, and it requires transcription on top of that for\nanother 20. So at 85 a month for just Draft One, we're looking at the AI error bundle price of 1 99 and,\nthe sum of the parts of that bundle is expected to be somewhere around 250 to $350 in terms of\neverything included in it. So good economics for buying, you know, as, as a group of features instead of\nindividual standalone features. but that'll be the price going into next year.\nGeoge Notter Analyst, Jefferies\nGreat. Thank you.\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThose are just the launch features. Of course, the features in the AI era plan are going to grow rapidly.\n7\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nGeoge Notter Analyst, Jefferies\nMakes sense. Thanks.\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAnd I would probably just note that, you'll hear us talking more and more about the AI bundle plan and\nless and less about Draft One as sort of an individual product or an individual data point. It's really going\nto, as Josh said, be the anchor product in the new AI bundle. We'll continue to add features there, but\nthat's what you'll hear us talking about quarter to quarter.\nJeff Kunins Chief Product Officer & Chief Technology Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThat's right. And of course, you know, pretty much everything in that plan are pure SaaS software\nadditions on top of our overall software, ARR Of course, they, you know, build upon people who have\nour hardware, like cameras and TASERs and the like, but the era plan itself is all good old SaaS.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks, George. Up next we've got Jonathan Ho at William Blair.\nJonathan Ho Analyst, William Blair\nHey, good afternoon. just wanted to get a sense from you as you start to think about sort of the broader\nopportunity around drones as a first responder. How should we think about, you know, maybe the\nability to monetize this the ability to see broader adoption and what sort of has to happen for that to\ntake place. Thank you.\nJeff Kunins Chief Product Officer & Chief Technology Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nRick, do you want to start? And I'll pile on.\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSorry, I had myself on mute. First Jonathan, are you cheating on us with the headphones listening to\nanother earnings call at the same time? <laugh>,\nJonathan Ho Analyst, William Blair\npotentially <laugh> <laugh>,\n8\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAwesome. Hey, so yeah, we see drones as a huge opportunity. The Dedrone acquisition, we think, is a\nreal key part of that. Because before you can start flying drones without extra humans standing around\nwatching them, you've got to be able to see your airspace. And an array of sensors can see the airspace\nfar better than a human on a rooftop. So part of our assessment in making the Dedrone acquisition was\na dual bet. Number one, that it would be a key enabler for DFR to be able to fly your own drones. You've\ngot to be able to see the airspace well. And then the second is that we're going to see increased interest\nin counter drone capabilities. I just learned this past week that apparently somebody in Pennsylvania\nput a pipe bomb on a drone and is going to fly it into critical infrastructure or something.\nWe'd be glad to see there has not been that much of that kind of activity here in the us but it's certainly\ngrowing all over the world. and what we certainly hope it doesn't come here, I think, it, it, it is\nsomething that's likely to get more nefarious use. And right now, counter drone is really limited to\nfederal agencies, meaning, you know, state and local cannot interdict the drones themselves. So drone\nis helpful in that case. Because it'll tell you where the pilot is and you can go deal with the pilot directly.\nHowever, there was a bill in Congress, I believe this year. I don't think it's going to make it through, but\nthere have been some efforts to give state and local law enforcement the ability to interdict drones. not\nto get into politics, but my assessment of the shift of, you know, of the election we're coming out of is\nthat that is likely to speed up, law enforcement enabling legislation, potentially including the local,\nability for law enforcement to ECT drones.\nSo Dedrone is a tech enabler. I think Skydio is a partner. You know, we sort of made a shift with the\nshifting relationship. DDJI, you know, as a Chinese drone manufacturer. we think there's legislation afoot\nthat passed the House of Representatives unanimously that's going to be blocking DJI long term and\nfrankly all Chinese, drones, and so we shifted our focus really to Skydio, who turns out is the world\nleader in autonomy already, you know, for drones that can fly themselves effectively. So we think\nbetween the partnership, the acquisition of Dedrone, and then some pending legislative changes that I\nwould expect within 24 months, we'll see a shifting landscape to where our state and local folks can\nbegin using more aggressive counter drone capabilities. And by the way, last thing I'll say is we did a full\nscan of the of the world's sort of counter drone providers a few years ago before we selected Dedrone.\nand we liked Dedrone strategy. They were very focused on detection, and not getting too aggressive on\nmitigation, knowing that that, you know, basically owning the detection space and being at a lower cost\npoint than some of the competitors that have been out there focused on more military style interdiction\nefforts has given them a good footprint to scale from. And then the strategy's been able to plug in other\nhardware over time as the legal landscape changes.\nJeff Kunins Chief Product Officer & Chief Technology Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAnd, and then Jonathan, just add two things to Rick's great summary. One thing that we're super\npumped about is how the market's evolving to think about the real time crime center space and the DFR\nspace together, which we think is both right and good for agencies and communities and plays right into\nour strengths and our differentiation as a solution. So the combination of Fusus, in the real time crime\ncenter, deeply connected with all of our other devices, and then into the DFR partnership stuff that Rick\nwas just talking about, agencies are thinking about buying those together, and that's both great for\nthem as they think about how they use this technology to keep communities safe. And it plays right into\nall of Exxon's strengths. and the second, which is another example of that same thing, we just had a\n9\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nmajor agency, who's in the middle of rolling out their DFR stuff the other day, talk unprompted about\nthe notion of they would love to have an officer be able to press that watch me button that, you know,\nwe have on our AB four cameras and have that under the right conditions automatically trigger, the\ndispatch of A DFR drone to bring help and extra Overwatch to that situation even faster than what any\nother human in the loop could be.\nAnd that's exactly the kind of solution that's powered by the combination of all the things we bring to\nbear for agencies.\nJonathan Ho Analyst, William Blair\nExcellent. And then just as a follow up, I mean, TASER again, had very strong quarter. You know, we, we\nregularly receive the question whether, you know, the TASER business can sustain this level of growth,\nand you just want to get a sense from, you know, what gives you the confidence that we can continue to\nsee, you know, TASER be one of the major drivers of the business. Or, or maybe do you see, you know, a\nshift in leadership where, you know, things like Draft One will start to take over that growth over time.\nThank you.\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThey do compete for the top slot and it does make me proud that the old war warhorse that's TASER can\nstill, can still run. so we, you know, I think we've got so many things that have the opportunity to\ncontinue, you know, to be disruptive and to grow. The big one for TASER, just to come back on, that to\nme is really international. I think we are on the cusp, and actually I'm getting text updates from my\nengineers that are in the lab today actually working on some pretty cool stuff related to TASER that, we\nthink we have the opportunity in the next couple of years to become the primary weapon\ninternationally. Now in the US the gun is going to remain primary for quite a while culturally, because\npolice are dealing with so many guns out in the public. But in much of the world, a gun is just if you had\na viable high reliability alternative and for within that 45 foot range, and I'll just tell you the last thing\nwe're working on is clothing penetration. Once we get that dialed in, we've got a shot at becoming the\nprimary self-defense weapon in international markets where there's not a high propensity of, you know,\nhandguns out in the public. And I think that could be a real game changer for TASER.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAnd I might just add one or two more thoughts there about the question of, you know, is this\nsustainable for the TASER business to keep growing in? In my opinion, the answer is absolutely yes. Like,\nwe're year two of five in an upgrade cycle right now. we continue to see exceptionally strong demand,\nliterally double what it was. you know, as we've said on previous calls, you know, with T seven and so,\ncertainly a lot of runway ahead to continue to grow the TASER business and look like, as Rick said, the\nTASER business is going to solve one of the most critical issues in policing over the long term, which is,\nthat these encounters can end in death either from a civilian or, you know, a police officer. And if we can\nsolve that problem, I still think we're scratching the surface of what the TASER business is capable of.\n10\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nJust, just from a detailed sort of modeling perspective, I don't know that I would expect every quarter to\nbe as strong as this quarter was. This was a particularly strong quarter for TASER. And that is partly\nbecause we got more capacity online for the TASER business, which helps us go fulfill all of that demand.\nSo just from a growth standpoint, I would say this quarter really stood out. and it continues to be across\nboth T10 and, you know, our, our T7 and, and legacy handles. So, that was a little bit unique, but\neverything Rick and Josh said about the long-term trajectory, you know, the power of T10, the ability to\nsell it into different markets holds over, over the long term.\nJonathan Ho\nAnalyst, William Blair Excellent. Thank you again and congrats on the strong quarter.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks, Jonathan. Up next we have Mike Ng at Goldman Sachs.\nMike Ng Analyst, Goldman Sachs\nGood afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I wanted to follow up on a comment made\nabout four Q ‘24. I think you said it would be likely a record bookings quarter. Is that right? And was the\nyear ago four Q bookings in that like 1.7, $1.8 billion range, just to make sure we're thinking about that\nthe right way. And if you could talk about some of the visibility and the, the confidence that you have in\nthose things that you mentioned, you know, federal bookings increasing sequentially international\nbookings. Is it AI era? Is it, you know, the pipeline growth that you've seen coming out of IACP? would\njust love some color around the, the bookings outlook that you gave for four Q. Thank you.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSure. yeah, certainly reiterating that I'm very confident and encouraged here in terms of what we're\ngoing to do in Q4 bookings. probably won't give you a specific number other than we expect it to, you\nknow, exceed last quarter. And I think on the last call I said the sum of Q3 and Q4 this year, will be, you\nknow, comparable to what we did in the full year last year in terms of booking. So we're very, bullish on\nbookings. part of what's informing that confidence is just tremendous execution across all four\nsegments of the business, state and loca,l enterprise, federal and international. We have meaningfully\nmeaningful deals in all four of those segments in Q4 and a lot of them, such that there's not a huge\npercentage of the bookings would be concentrated on one deal. We feel really, really good about the\nfoundation and we're excited to, to talk in more detail about our Q4 bookings in February.\n11\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThere, there's been a couple questions now about like what's, what's going to do better or what's going\nto drive the growth going forward. I think one of the things that I like so much that this quarter\ndemonstrates is the growth is across the board. So, you might get a little more from one segment, one\nquarter and a little more from another segment, another quarter, but really across the business, you\nknow, the, the devices on the strength of AB four TASER on the strength of, TASER 10. And then our\nsoftware, you know, on the strength of both our existing software businesses continuing to perform\nwell. And then the very bright future that we think the AI plan has will continue to drive software. And\nso, you know, you'll see a slightly different mix every quarter, but as you look long term, you really\nshould expect all three of those pieces to continue driving our growth.\nMike Ng Analyst, Goldman Sachs\nExcellent. Thanks. And if, if I could follow up on the earlier TASER question. I counted, this was the sixth\nconsecutive quarter where TASER has hit revenue record. You talked a little bit about faster than\nexpected adoption. I think if we look back to TASER 7, it probably took you, I think, five years to get to 80\nto 85% adoption. How much shorter can that be? And could you just remind us like what's the typical\nprice mix or ASP uplift versus TASER 7? Thank you.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSo, Mike, the question was how fast can we get to 85% adoption on T 0 versus T7?\nMike Ng Analyst, Goldman Sachs\nYes, that's right.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nOkay, I think, that would be setting our sights short. I would say our goal is to transition every T7 and\nlegacy model TASER into a T10. And we think we have an opportunity to do that. You know, I, I think,\nthis, this TASER 10 while, while each TASER is an incremental improvement over the last one, TASER 10\nis just a fundamental massive leap forward in the technology, in the de-escalation capabilities, in the\nofficer safety features. We really believe that, you know, every cop will be best served with a TASER set\nwith a TASER 10, I'm sorry. And certainly, as we go into the next few years of the Taser 10 lifecycle, the\nprimary goal is upgrade and replacement of the current Fleet. And, and again, we're very confident in\nour ability to do that.\nMike Ng Analyst, Goldman Sachs\nGreat. Excellent. Thank you, Josh.\n12\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThank you.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Mike. Up next we have Joe Cardoso at JP Morgan.\nJoe Cardoso Analyst, J.P. Morgan\nHi. Thanks for the questioning guys. I guess maybe just a quick clarification on the bookings. And Josh,\ncan you just like quickly clarify if your comments today, are you guys on track to meet the bogey that\nyou laid out last quarter in achieving bookings in line with full year 23 in the back half of this year? Or is\nit more like unknown? I'm just curious if you could just flesh that out a little bit more. Because it does\nseem like perhaps you're a little bit off pace and I just want to make sure that I'm not thinking about\nthat incorrectly.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nI'd say you're thinking about that incorrectly.\nJoe Cardoso Analyst, J.P. Morgan\nOkay. And then, so when you, when you're going into the back half of this year, like where are you\nactually seeing the growth in driving these bookings across the portfolio? Is it really all broad base in\nterms of the, the entire portfolio? Are you guys embedding any of the new AI suite in that in terms of\nthe releases there? Just curious in terms of like how you're thinking about the drivers in the rank\nordering, and then I have a quick follow up.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nYeah, sure. Look, I certainly appreciate the question, Joe, and these deals that are going to be closed in\nQ4 are deals that, you know, generally a six-to-12-month sales cycle at, at a minimum, right? These\nthings take the full year to come together. We talk in Q1 when bookings are seasonally light, you know,\ntraditionally that part of that is the team is getting their arms around the new products and the new\npricing, getting their arms around their new book of business as the territories can change and so forth.\nAnd so that's really where the groundwork goes into like building the pipeline for the rest of the year.\nAnd naturally most of that closes in Q3 and Q4, especially when you see some of the biggest budgets in\nthe country, the federal government, Florida, Texas all ending on September 30th.\nYou know, you get a lot of, you know, September action and then you get a lot of new budget dollars\nbeing spent in Q4. And so I don't know that the AI bundle is going to have a major impact on Q4 since\nwe launched it in the same quarter. We're still building the pipe for the long term for some of our newer\nfeatures and products. So the big driver of a lot of these deals is officer safety plan, execution in the\n13\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nstate and local market and some large deals and International, Federal and Enterprise that have been\ncoming together over the course of several quarters. So certainly expect Q4, to really trump Q3 in terms\nof just the absolute dollars and the normalized bookings, but it's also the result of a lot of pipeline\nbuilding that happened throughout the year.\nJoe Cardoso Analyst, J.P. Morgan\nNo, got it. Very clear, Josh. Thanks. I appreciate the explanation there. And then maybe a question for\nBrittany, just margins subtract nicely through the year and expanded each quarter and even\noutperforming kind of your expectations, if I'm remembering the guides correctly. So as we look here\ninto the fourth quarter, the guide here for a sequential decline, can you maybe just walk us through\nwhat has been the driver of outperformance and margins over the past couple of quarters, and then\nrelative to your expectations going into this quarter, like what's different that's driving your expectation\nfor the sequential decline to occur in the fourth quarter itself? Thanks for the questions.\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nWe've actually done a pretty good job hitting our expense targets and our Opex targets, and then our\nrevenue has outperformed. And so what you're really seeing is some nice flow through on that higher\ntop line revenue coming through to the bottom line. It's been really nice to see how the team has been\nable to scale and get some leverage out of the Opex and especially on the SG&A side. When we look at\nQ4 though, we also expect that some of the benefit has been timing, right? Like we've been talking\nabout timing, not everything hits exactly in the quarter. So we've been a little bit behind on some of our\nexpense spend as we've gone through the first three quarters. We expect to catch up on some of that in\nQ4. And then the other thing is we expect to have a full quarter of Dedrone and some of the integration\ncosts associated with Dedrone in Q4, now that we have closed that deal.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAnd I might just add one more thought on, on adjusted EBITDA, just high level, which is, the thing I'm\nmost excited about is the fact that, we are not sacrificing R&D to achieve these results, right? Like,\nthat's, that, you know, it, it would be very easy to drive up a adjusted EBITDA by mortgaging the future.\nAnd I don't think anyone feels that way right now. We're still in the place of just loading up on new\nopportunities and investing relentlessly in them. we're just seeing like Brittany said, over delivery and a\nlot more discipline in SG&A as well.\nJoe Cardoso Analyst, J.P. Morgan\nThanks Brittany. Thanks Josh. Appreciate the color.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks, Joe. Up next we have Jamie Reynolds at Morgan Stanley.\n14\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nJamie Reynolds Analyst, Morgan Stanley\nHey, good afternoon, everyone, and congrats again on the quarter. Rick, I know you just mentioned\nthere's probably some stuff to keep an eye on for the international market going forward, but just given\nthe strength and bookings that you've kind of seen through the year, I guess, could you give us a sense\nas to what's driving maybe the improved traction kind of near term and kind of as we go into next year?\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nIt really is broad based. I think, Jeff was it six, seven months ago, I had just come back from a tech\nconference and told Jeff, we need to pull the emergency break and take a look at all of our product\ndevelopment plans and look at where AI would enable new features that weren't even on our visibility\nlist a year ago. Not, not the emergency break turn the wheel <laugh> <laugh>. Well, no, this is the one\nwhere you're in reverse and you pull the brake. It's like the Duke's of Hazard and you anyways drifting. It\nwas, it was, a, a pretty big shift. and for example, one that came out of that, we also, I did these AI round\ntables, well, they're, they're customer round tables, but we did one really focused on AI.\nAnd one thing that became very clear was being able to do real time translation on a body camera\nwould be just insanely valuable. it, it rated at the top of the charts. And so we pivoted, you know, Jeff\nbasically, as you can imagine, like how disruptive this is to his days, managing like 1,015 hundred\nengineers. And it's like, Hey, hold on, we, I know we've got everything planned and everybody's working,\nbut let's like disrupt everything. I think that enabled us to talk about six or seven major new AI features\nby IACP already. and I'm really proud, you know, companies at our scale, it's hard to move like that, but I\nthink that, so our customers are seeing, again, things that just feel almost magical that are possible with\nAI and our investment in things like our EEAC, our, ethics advisory Council to help us do safety testing on\nthings like Draft One, just simply running tests to see if you change the race of the subject, does that\npick up any historical bias from the global data set that these models are trained on?\nAnd, and we did pick up some things like word choice, you know, if it says the, the man fled the scene\nversus the man left the scene, you know, can really change the emotional perception of that statement.\nAnd so, you know, we did things like tuning down the word choice severity so that our AI writes the\nmost boring police report it can write because it's a human's job to add emotion and tone to it. Anyway,\nI think that focus is really rejuvenated interest in the real-time connectivity of body cameras. You all may\nremember a few years ago we had this whole debate about when we were developing AB3, should we\nput a wireless chip, a cellular LTE chip in the camera. Our customers were telling us they actually, not\nonly were they not interested in it, they were skeptical of it.\nWe were hearing things like, ah, I don't want my boss watching me real time and micromanaging me\nfrom the field. And we still said, you know, just, it may not be, maybe they don't want a real stream real\ntime video, but there's going to be something they're going to want to do. And so, not only did we\ndecide to put the LTE chip in the camera, we decided to put it in every camera. We made a decision not\nto sell a camera without it, because we knew our customers, if we had a cheaper camera without the\nthing they didn't know they needed yet, that's the one they would buy. And there was some short-term\npain because our cost of goods crept up. And as maybe you know, our customers are on these upgrade\nplans where they get the next camera and we don't get to charge them any more for it.\n15\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nSo eating, you know, an $80 bomb increase, on the hopes and dreams that we would find, you know, a,\na value for that, was a bit of a risky bet. Well, now that's really coming home to roost because things like\nDraft One are only possible because of that realtime connectivity, realtime translation only possible\nbecause of that realtime, connectivity. So I think we're now reaping the gains of some of those bets we\nmade historically. and it's across the portfolio. I don't think there's any one thing that's what makes this\njust so exciting. I mean, it makes Jeff's job so difficult, and Brittany's, because I'm throwing a thousand\nfeatures at Jeff, and he is like, hold on, slow, slow it down. We’ve got to like rationalize the sequencing\nand when we're going to build things and what are the things that are going to be, delightful to use out\nof the gate now that aren't going to customer expectations. And of course Brittany is making sure that\nwe're holding the line on how much we're spending on all this stuff. So anyways…\nJeff Kunins Chief Product Officer & Chief Technology Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSo one just thought I think again, is one, so many of the things that are a Goldilocks and magical, I think\nabout Axon's flywheel, for lack of a better phrase, connecting like the questions about what's happening\nwith bookings or demand, like right now. And then everything Rick's talking about the future is it's, you\nknow, all of our new innovations are really leading indicators of this time next year's growth, not about\nthis quarter's growth because of the sales cycle stuff, because of building stuff, but they feed into\ncustomer's excitement about their bet on Axon for the long term. But the bookings that are this quarter,\nnext quarter are about the pipe, as Josh talked about that got, that got laid nine months ago, and it all\nconnects in that ongoing sequence beating upon itself in a really virtuistic way that we're super excited\nabout.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAnd Jamie, was your question specific to international?\nJamie Reynolds Analyst, Morgan Stanley\nYeah, yeah, it was just kind of what's driving that improved uptake internationally?\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nYeah, for sure. You're going to actually answer the question he asked. <laugh> <laugh>, everything's\noptional, but we might as well answer that one as well. <laugh>. so on, on international, look, you know,\nas, as you know, we, in searching for a new CRO, our, our big priority was upping our game\ninternationally. And Cameron Brooks has come in really, you know, early on this year, hit the ground\nrunning and has, has really just helped up our game in terms of the, the quality of the team, the quality\nof the execution, how we're executing now, but also building for the future. And I think just across the\nboard, we've got some new players on the team that are really good kind of free agent signings. We've\ngot a lot of customer momentum from the work that's been done in the last couple years.\n16\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc\nAnd we're starting to frankly just see things come together at a more polished level. You know, there's\nstill a long way to go. There's still a huge TAM out there, everything's going to take time internationally\njust due to the fact you're dealing with federal governments in all of these countries, not, you know,\nstate and local police forces that are able to operate semi autonomously. So it's still going to be a grind,\nbut we really, really believe we're on the right track. And it's a tribute to the team we're building here\nled by Cameron.\nJamie Reynolds Analyst, Morgan Stanley\nGreat. Thank you so much. Congrats again.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc\nYou got it, Jamie. Thanks.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Jamie. Up next we have Jordan at Bank of America.\nJordan Lyonnais Analyst, Bank of America\nHey, thank you guys for taking the question. On the administration change, how are you guys looking at\nthe opportunities versus the risks involved, just with what plans have been said, if they come true or\nnot, the increased emphasis on border security versus tariffs?\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc\nYeah. I appreciate the question, Jordan. I'd say the first thing that I want to make really clear is like we\nhave a very apolitical culture at Axon. We know we've got to be successful in a democratic\nadministration as well as a Republican administration. And, you know, we've seen that over the last 10\nyears with, with both parties being in power and the business continuing to grow. of course there are\ngoing to be some interesting opportunities for us, in the new administration that's focused primarily on\nborder security. We’re excited about how we can help there and, you know, new capabilities that we\ncan bring to the table to offer support on that. But at the high level, certainly we believe saving lives,\ndriving transparency and delivering disruptive technologies to governments and public safety agencies\naround the world. Those are things that are really not specific to which party is in power and we're really\nfocused on just delivering the best products we can.\n17\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nJordan Lyonnais Analyst, Bank of America\nThanks. And then on just, if tariffs are imposed, how are you looking at what levers you can pull to offset\nany supply chain component changes?\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc\nYeah, so, we've certainly lived in an environment of tariffs before. I think our philosophy is generally to\nbe pretty flexible. We've got multiple sources from a supplier standpoint. We manufacture our TASERs\nin the U.S. so then it'll really be on component parts as those come in. We'll just work through it and,\nand we'll be flexible and be nimble as those come through and as we see what they are.\nJordan Lyonnais Analyst, Bank of America\nThank you guys.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks, Jordan. Up next we have Josh Reilly at Needham.\nJosh Reilly Analyst, Needham & Co., LLC\nAlright, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting off, can you discuss how the, FedRAMP\nstatus and your position as the, I believe the only cloud, body cam vendor with the highest level\nFedRAMP status, has been helping you win some of these U.S. federal opportunities. And how, just\nalong with that, how has the growth in U.S. Federal been, I guess, relative to the broader business this\nyear? Is it significantly above the consolidated growth rate? I know you don't break it out, but any color\nthere would be helpful.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc\nYeah, thanks a lot. Josh, on the first question regarding FedRAMP, look like we, we've invested a lot and\nwe've put a lot of effort into being a FedRAMP high product, in the federal government, no question\nabout that. And, and that's certainly a differentiator for us, but I would be so bold as to say, even if\neverybody was on FedRAMP, we're still winning the majority of deals in state and local where we're\ncompeting against the same companies with without FedRAMP. And so I think it's more of a tribute to\nthe team's quality product delivery and the federal team's phenomenal execution on the sales, and\nmore importantly, the support front for our, for our federal law enforcement customers. And so, the\nteam's done a nice job this year. There's as I said, in my remarks, there's a lot to still close in Q4. We\ncould have a better Q4 than Q3, you know, in the federal space, which is generally uncommon because\nof the end of the budget year at the end of Q3. And so, we'll have to see where the dust settles. But, you\nknow, certainly exciting double-digit growth from federal and, and a lot of conviction that we're on the\nright path there.\n18\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nJosh Reilly Analyst, Needham & Co., LLC\nGot it. That's helpful. And then, just going back to the TASER revenues, you know, I think we all generally\nknow that the capacity has been increasing sequentially, but maybe just over the next three or four\nquarters, should we assume that, you know, I, I know you said that maybe the sequential increases in\nrevenue may not be the same, but is it safe to assume there's still more capacity increases that will be\ncoming in the next kind of three to five quarters as well? Thank you.\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nYeah, for sure. As we talk about capacity, we have both cart capacity and handle capacity. And as you\ncan imagine, we're working to bring both of those up to meet the demand. We see, there are lead times,\nwe do have automation equipment, so it's not, we can't always turn on as much supply immediately as\nwe would like to. So you can see the results of us getting more supply on this quarter. And then again,\nthe growth was particularly impressive this quarter. I want to temper everyone's expectations, you\nknow, on that looking the same every quarter. But yes, we'll keep bringing capacity on as we continue to\nsee demand increase.\nJosh Reilly Analyst, Needham & Co., LLC\nAwesome. Thanks guys.\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThank you.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Josh. Up next, we'll go to Trevor Walsh at JMP.\nTrevor Walsh Analyst, JMP\nGreat. Thanks, team for taking the questions. Maybe Rick or Josh, kind of high level one for you, circling\nback to the Dedrone or, or just general DFR opportunity. Does that seem to be, in your minds, kind of a\nstate and local U.S. domestic kind of initial push? Or is there international, opportunities along the, the\nlines there? I guess I ask from the standpoint of, seems like the landing with TASER 10, TASER of any\nkind, whether it's TASER 10 or previous models, is sort of the the tip of the spear for the, the U.S.\nbusiness. and it seems to be following a similar type of path and kind of the international front, but just\ncurious if there's, you know, ways for DFR type of use cases to be more, again, of that tip of the spear,\nkind of on the international front with respect to Dedrone and the other things you guys are doing.\n19\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nSure. If I could start, first just Dedrone by itself without DFR, ton of interest internationally, I mean,\nevery country in the world is now thinking about how they're going to deal with drone threats in the\npast 24 months. And in many cases, AD brought just a great capabilities, the CEO of Dedrone, and he is\nbrought us new customers too, whether it was the World Cup in Qatar, you know, the NFL stadiums,\ncritical infrastructure. And then we've seen the same thing with Fusus. I mean, both of these\nacquisitions, these were two big bites for us to take, you know, this closely together. It's been really just\nimpressive, how much customer interest there has been in those, you know, with Fusus, that's really\nsupercharged our enterprise customers, you know, enterprises want to be able to work collaboratively\nwith public safety and Fusus becomes the backbone of doing that in real time.\nDedrone, we think there's, there's more. You know, it's a new angle into military customers for us.\nmilitaries around the world are very interested in how you deal with these small first person or Mavic\nstyle drones, critical infrastructure and then enterprise there as well. So I'd say Dedrone even on its own\nis I think not only interesting to our existing customers, but frankly probably even more interesting to\nthe new customer sets they're bringing to us. The DFR is what's making counter drone especially\nrelevant. When I survey our customers in state and local, the responses are, yeah, we're kind of\ninterested in counter drone, but that's not really our mission set today to be dealing with hostile drones\ncoming in. Now that for us is more of a future bet, that's going to come on your plate as those threats\ngrow. But the DFR thing is here and now that's where our customers really light up.\nOh, if I can use Dedrone to enable DFR, I want to be able to fly my own drones, and that's something I\ncan do today, but I've got to do it in this awkward way where I've got to have people standing on\nrooftops and it's kind of this manual klugy thing and we make it much safer and less klugy by putting a\nDedrone sensor up there. I also am getting interest, where was it? We had a, another DFR use case, in\none of our other markets that's not drone as a first responder, but, for competitive reasons, I don't want\nto name which sector it is, but this is a non-law enforcement sector, and they don't need to be flying\ndrones as first responder, but boy, they sure would like to be able to fly drones on automated patrol\naround their facilities. And so our partnership with Skydio and the acquisition of Dedrone and all that\nreally come together naturally for us to be able to service a lot more than just drone as a first responder\nfor police, if you want to fly a drone without having to have manual human overseers on site, like we\ncan take that. And by the way, Skydio is a partner as well, brings us into potentially new customers and\ncritical infrastructure and elsewhere where we haven't been historically.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Rick. Thanks Trevor. Up next we have, Keith Housum at Northcoast.\nKeith Housum Analyst, Northcoast Research Partners, LLC\nGood morning guys. I know we're going to run long here, so I'll try and make my questions quick. Just\nreal quick, Brittany, you talk about, probably like a bit of pull forward or can I pull forward but catching\nup with a T 10 with your capacity, how much of growth in the quarter would you say was more catching\nup with capacity as opposed to normalized demand?\n20\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nI would break it out necessarily, Keith. What I would say is we've had incredible demand, like our\ndemand has been outpacing our capacity. So as that demand grows every quarter, we need to bring\nmore capacity on. And so what you saw this quarter was the combination of the two. I wouldn't say, it's\nnot like we chewed through backlog or something like that to deliver. You're just seeing the ability for us\nto ship more into that demand.\nKeith Housum Analyst, Northcoast Research Partners, LLC\nGotcha. Appreciate it. And then services, I know services can be lumpy, but if we look at a sequential\ngrowth and services of about $6 million, probably the lowest has grown sequentially for several years. If\nI look correct at it correctly, Amy happened in the quarter, or how should we think about services going\nforward?\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nForward? Yeah, great. Great question. I think there's two pieces in that. One, there's a little bit of a lag in\nthat step as you go through each quarter. So what we really booked in Q3 will show up in Q4, so a little\nbit of what you're seeing in the step in the quarter is sort of what was going on in Q2 from a booking\nstandpoint. And that's because many of the bookings come in pretty late in the quarter, so the revenue\nfrom that doesn't necessarily get captured in our actual number. Then the other piece that's going on in\nthere is that's both our software step and our services business, and so with some of the deployments of\nour Fleet hardware being down in the quarter, which you can see in the Fleet number, we actually had\nless professional services associated with Fleet. And so that's actually offsetting some of the software\npiece. So if you were just looking at software, you would see a larger step than what's coming through in\nthe number you're actually seeing. because we actually had a step down in PSO, which is atypical.\nNormally PSO is growing and software is growing, but because Fleet came down this quarter, you're\nseeing that dynamic.\nKeith Housum Analyst, Northcoast Research Partners, LLC\nGotcha. Okay. I'll reach, I'll turn back over. Thank you.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Keith. We'll try to get everyone in here. We have Will Power at Baird.\nWilliam Verity Power Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nOkay, awesome. Thank you all. Congratulations on a strong quarter on execution. Question probably for\nBrittany, the software and ARR growth continues to be very good. There was some deceleration from\nthe trend line you've been on there. I wonder if there's any other color or impacts to kind of be aware of\n21\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\nthere and how to think about modeling that going forward. Is mid-thirties kind of the right growth rate\nand what are the puts and takes there?\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nYeah, I mean, I, we really look at that sort of on an average basis. I think because of the dynamics I just\ntalked about of timing of when bookings come in in a quarter, looking at any one quarter is not as good\nas sort of averaging out over the year. And you do have things like seasonality playing into that. So I\nwould say nothing underlying it that would change our sort of four to six quarter average on anything.\nThe step on ARR growth, on any of that you're just seeing a little bit of timing and a quarterly lag is\nwhat's showing up in Q3 is really Q2. What'll show up in Q4 is really what we're talking about with\nstrength in Q3. And then what'll show up in Q1, it'll be whatever we deliver in Q4.\nWilliam Verity Power Analyst, Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.\nOkay. yeah, just for time. I'll leave it there. Thank you all.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nWe have one left with Jeremy Hamblin at Craig-Hallum.\nJeremy Hamblin Analyst, Craig-Hallum Capital Group, LLC\nThanks, and congrats on another fantastic quarter. I want to come back to TASER, just for a second. I\nthink 50% year over year growth, really impressive and it sounds like getting great traction on the\ninternational front. I wanted to see if we could, you know, unpack the driver there and it sounds like it's\nreally picking up on the international piece of the business. We know that there's a lot of opportunity\ndomestically still, but internationally, is this more about the capability and I think, you know, just seeing\nwhat the device does versus the prior version. it is a, a huge step forward from a technology\nperspective. Does this make you think that the longer term potential is quite a bit bigger internationally\nthan maybe what you'd seen before? That's part one of my question. The second part, it actually has to\ndo with cartridge. Cartridge revenue relative to the growth inTASER was really not, you know, that that\nwas, it was up I think maybe about 10% year over year. And I was just curious if there was something, in\nparticular there, why that didn’t grow a little bit stronger.\nBrittany Bagley Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nYeah, I can maybe start with cartridge 'cause that's easy and then if Josh wants to talk more about\nTASER, he can. Most of our TASER customers are on sort of a cartridge deployment plan, which smooths\nout how you see cartridge revenue come in. But we do have international customers who are not on a\nplan. And so, what you'll see is every now and then our cartridge revenue is particularly lumpy quarter\nto quarter. And so last quarter we had some big international customers come in and place cartridge\norders and then those didn't repeat this quarter. So again, I'd look at a longer trend line of cartridge\n22\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\ngrowth, versus last quarter to this quarter. And then I think the only other thing I would add, maybe to\ngive a little more color on TASER before I let it go over to Josh is last quarter in his script, Josh talked a\nbit about how much demand we're seeing for TASER 10 relative to TASER 7. I think he said demand is\nsort of two x the pace, but we are still seeing really good performance from TASER 7. And so part of\nwhat you're seeing in this quarter is not only are you getting all of those benefits from Taser 10 that\nwe've been talking about, but we do still have customers ordering Taser 7 and some of our other legacy\nTASER handles and products. And so, you know, that that sort of combining to give a particularly nice\nresult.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nYeah, and I'd just add, Jeremy, I'd say it's in part due to international, certainly it's a big TAM, we're\ngetting better there. We're building relationships kind of with the right customers. We're doing a better\njob explaining and demonstrating the value that TASERs bring to police, both in terms of lives saved, but\nalso in terms of officer safety increasing and workers' comp decreasing and just some of the issues, that\ncome along with the absence of TASER deployments. But I think the bigger thing is just very simple. We\nhave phenomenal product market fit with this product and that's really a credit to Rick. Like our\ncustomers are for the first time really seeing that man this thing is on track to outperforming a firearm in\nthe field.\nAnd, and we had been talking about it for a long time, but for 30 years with only up to two shots, that\nwas still kind of a pipe dream and now we're seeing it with 10 shots and customers are saying, man, you\nknow, the increased distance of 45 feet combined with the number of shots combined with the better\npenetration, those are all things that I think are inspiring more confidence in the device from our\ncustomers, whether they be in state and local or federal or international. And so I think that's really it.\nIt's like good sales execution with a product that has phenomenal product market fit.\nJeremy Hamblin Analyst, Craig-Hallum Capital Group, LLC\nGreat. Thanks for all the color, best wishes.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Jeremy. It was nice to see many of you at IACP. Thanks for making the trip out there and always\ngreat to see you at the booth.\nErik Lapinski Senior Director, Investor Relations, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nThanks Jeremy, and thanks everyone. That's it for us. We'll give it to Rick to close this out.\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nAll right, so I have two things I want to conclude on. One, I want to be careful that my previous\nstatement when I talked about the election results, I'm not talking about which party won where I'm\n23\nAxon Enterprise, Inc. (AXON) | Q3 2024 Earnings Call | Thursday, November 7, 2024\ntalking about the overall political environment. For example, in California, voters approved Proposition\n36 that basically raised the penalties for shoplifting and certain drug crimes. We're seeing a general shift\nthat manifested in this election, swinging the pendulum more supportive of public safety in general. And\nI would say at our company, we are violently nonpartisan. We have passionate gun control advocates\nand passionate Second Amendment gun owners who come to meetings together and are productive.\nand you could say that across all the divisive issues in politics. And I think Josh in particular is going to\ngreat job from setting the tone from leadership perspective that we want to be an intellectually diverse\nplace that where everyone is welcome and we keep the divisive stuff like out of the office because we've\ngot a job to do. And, we do best when the best, brightest, smartest, most passionate people, no matter\ntheir political views, feel like this is a place where they can come and do their best work. And then the\nother thing I wanted to say was, Brittany, man, two years, it's flown by. What you're seeing right now, I\nmean, we see a lot of Brittany's fingerprints on the P&L. She really does a great job of just driving both\noperating and financial rigor. I come back from customers with all sorts of ideas. Some people might say\nthey're crazy and some of them are, and between Brittany and Jeff, they've got to figure out, okay, how\ndo we sort through what we're actually going to execute on? What's actually going to go into a product?\nYou see Jeff give you the thumbs up, he said it's great, Rick, this is really fuzzy idea, that his idea is to\ntake it from fuzzy to concrete, and for Brittany to work with the team, make sure we can make this stuff\nand execute and make money on it. And then, you know, Josh, the other key member of the team here,\nhe's our Jimmy Johnson as a lifelong Cowboys fan, as I'm sure he'll appreciate that reference. He is our\nhead coach and really focuses on just building the team and the people, and that is the magic that we're\nseeing now is we've got these awesome productive dynamic tensions between our team as we each\nhave different strengths and weaknesses. and that through the whole organization, you're just seeing a\nphenomenal execution. And I would also say, hey, you're the ownership is part of this team as well. So\nwe appreciate our shareholders and the analysts who take the time to get to know us over the years and\nare supportive of us using our shareholders' capital to go solve these problems that we're excited and\ninterested to go do that fundamentally we believe make the world a better place when we're done. And\nthat motivates everybody to come to work excited.\nJoshua Isner President, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nRick, I would've appreciated a Belichick comparison over Jimmy Johnson, but we'll, we'll let that one\nslide.\nPatrick W. Smith Chief Executive Officer & Founder, Axon Enterprise, Inc.\nWell, I should have made a bet whether I could get that by without comment. <laugh>. Alright, so thanks\neverybody, thanks to our team, those people listening on the phone, what a phenomenal quarter, and\nwe're really excited to talk to you after the first year. Everybody have a fantastic holiday season. Hug\nyour kids and your family. Hopefully the world's going to get a little less crazy over the next couple\nyears. And it's been over the last few with what's been happening in the Middle East in Ukraine, and it's\nbeen just so much violence in the world. I self-admittedly was maybe too optimistic in my 2017 or 18\nbook, the End of Killing that thought we were at the end of war. We have proven sort of the thesis was\nwrong in terms of timing, but I do think humanity can do better and we can find ways to deal with\nthreats, while minimizing the loss of life. And, and we're going to stay true to that mission. So thanks\neverybody. Enjoy the holidays. We'll see you next year.\n24\nAxon Enterprise, Inc.

This calculation includes high-margin warranty but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription contingent of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a\nsoftware-as-a-service (“SaaS”) metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit 12\nof new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments --meaning that for the year-ago\nperiod, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution.

Note that with Axon’s integrated bundles, under ASC 606, product (hardware) revenue is recognized upon shipment to the\ncustomer and service (software) revenue is recognized over time as a time-based obligation to the customer.The TAM, as presented, shows potentialannual subscription spending.Subscription spending equalsrevenue recognized over the life of a multi-year contract, but spending and revenue do not always match up in the same\nyear due to the timing difference between subscription-based payments and revenue recognition.The Digital Evidence Management TAM products include Axon Evidence licenses and storage for both 1P and 3P devices. “Added software” includes Auto-Tagging, Redaction, Third-Party Video Playback, Performance, Community 14\nRequest, My90 and Axon Fleet software, including ALPR. Real-time operations includes Axon Respond, Axon Dispatch and Fusus. The Axon Air TAM includes Axon drone and robotic security solutions, Sky-Hero and Dedrone. Axon's planned acquisition of Dedroneis expected to close in the 2H of 2024 and is subject to customary\nclosing conditions. The product and vertical level TAMs shown have been rounded to the nearest whole number and will not arrive at our total TAM of $77 billion when added together due to rounding.\n02\nAxon enjoys early TAM penetration & global expansion opportunity\nUS C OMMONWEA LT H EUR OPE LA T IN A MER IC A A SIA\nUser adoption of TASER devices is still\nearly outside of US state and local law\n35% 22% 3% 1% 0%\nenforcement.

body-worn cameras will be deployed to more than 10,000 RCMP officers across Canada, along with digital evidence management system Axon Evidence_\n\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Nov. 14, 2024 /[PRNewswire](http://www.prnewswire.com/)/ -- Axon (Nasdaq: AXON), the global public safety technology leader, today announced that, following a competitive procurement process, it has been awarded a Public Services and Procurement Canada-led contract to supply the [Royal Canadian Mounted Police](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4303568-1&h=2006587178&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rcmp-grc.gc.ca%2F&a=Royal+Canadian+Mounted+Police) (RCMP) with Axon Body 4 body-worn cameras and digital evidence management system Axon Evidence.\n\n[ ![TASER's Axon brand includes a growing suite of connected products and services from body cameras and digital evidence management tools to mobiles apps.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/231466/axon_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/231466/axon_logo.html)\n\nAxon President Josh Isner said: \"The opportunity to support the RCMP marks a significant international milestone for Axon in our continued mission to build safer communities and protect more lives in more places.\"\n\nOnce the rollout is complete, the RCMP will have deployed more than 10,000 Axon Body 4 body-worn cameras to frontline contract and federal police officers who serve communities across Canada's rural, urban and remote locations. In addition to body-worn cameras, the RCMP is deploying Axon Evidence across its service, enabling secure storage, management and sharing of evidentiary data.\n\nThe Axon Ecosystem is a connected network of hardware, software and sensor solutions that work together to streamline operations. Axon Body 4 integrates seamlessly with Axon Evidence, automatically uploading video to a secure cloud environment that ensures a strict chain of custody protecting the data and integrity of the videos. Axon Evidence leverages AI-powered tools and advanced technologies to quickly locate, transcribe and redact critical footage, saving officers significant time in reviewing evidence. This streamlined process enhances operational efficiency while maintaining the highest levels of security and integrity for all digital evidence.\n\nLearn more about Axon's technology suite and how it drives greater safety, efficiency and visibility for both officers and the communities they serve: [https://www.axon.com/ecosystem](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=4303568-1&h=100807472&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.axon.com%2Fecosystem&a=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.axon.com%2Fecosystem).\n\n**_About Axon_** Axon is a technology leader in global public safety.

and digital evidence management tools to mobiles apps.](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/231466/axon_logo.jpg) ](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/231466/axon_logo.html)\n\n  * Axon Cloud & Services revenue grows 36% to $203 million\n  * Annual recurring revenue grows 36% to $885 million\n  * Net income of $67 million supports non-GAAP net income of $113 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $145 million\n  * Raises full year revenue outlook to approximately $2.07 billion, over 32% annual growth; expects full year Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 24.6%\n\n\n\nFellow shareholders,\n\nAxon is proud to report strong third quarter results and raise our outlook for the remainder of the year once again. Robust demand for our products and services remains driven by our innovative product leadership and deep customer relationships. We delivered over 30% annual revenue growth in each of the first three quarters of 2024, marking our 11th consecutive quarter of growth above 25%, achieved third quarter net income margin of 12.3%, and Adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.7% — our highest in over three years.\n\nTASER revenue of $222 million grew 36% year over year, driven by demand for TASER 10 and associated cartridges and services. Axon Cloud & Services revenue of $203 million, grew 36% year over year. Strength in Axon Cloud & Services was driven by new customer adoption of Axon Evidence and continued expansion with our existing customers, supporting increased net revenue retention of 123%. Sensors & Other revenue of $120 million increased 18% year over year, driven by record demand for Axon Body cameras, with more than 100,000 units shipped in the quarter.\n\nAxon's third quarter results demonstrate strong product-market fit and support our increased outlook. We expect fourth quarter revenue in the range of $560 million to $570 million, representing over 30% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $130 million to $135 million, or approximately 23.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin. Our fourth quarter guidance implies full year 2024 revenue of approximately $2.07 billion, representing over 32% annual growth and full year Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 24.6%. We provide more detail on our product vision, most recent financial performance and improved outlook, below.\n\n**Select Highlights:**\n\n**Axon AI — The AI Era Plan** Axon has established itself as a leading technology vendor in public safety through our commitment to continually develop innovative solutions that enhance the customer experience with the Axon ecosystem. Axon AI further advances our leadership, featuring a suite of AI-powered products designed to increase operational efficiency, improve investigative accuracy and support proactive policing. Today, this includes Axon Auto-Transcribe, Draft One, automatic license plate reading (ALPR) and video redaction, to name a few.\n\nBeginning in Q4, our commitment has taken a new step forward with the introduction of the AI Era Plan. The AI Era Plan enables customers to subscribe to an expanding set of AI capabilities and features that further leverage our connected ecosystem as quickly as we can develop them. It provides new AI features in a subscription offering and gives customers access to unmatched value across our AI innovations by including the newest AI products we bring to market. Its exponential value is fully unlocked when combined with our officer safety plans (OSP). Draft One is one illustrative example already live and in customers' hands today, utilizing real-time connected body cameras, cloud evidence management, video transcription and generative AI.\n\n_\"Axon AI represents not just a single product, but a**commitment to continuous innovation for our customers**. We have developed a suite of AI-powered products and solutions designed to evolve with the demands of modern law enforcement — and our portfolio is only growing. As new capabilities emerge, we intend to integrate them seamlessly into our hardware and software solutions, enhancing our customers' workflows. This will enable officers to work smarter, faster, and more efficiently —**driving real change in public safety**._\"— Rick Smith, Axon Founder and CEO\n\nAxon believes we are most successful when we listen to our customers and seek to solve the most pertinent problems they face each day. Our development in AI is no different, and we are building this technology through deep collaboration and partnership with our customers. In October, we highlighted our vision for the AI Era Plan to more than 2,200 attendees at the 2024 International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) Annual Conference and more than 2,000 attendees at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Annual Meeting. Our demonstrations featured products available today and a roadmap of additional, in-development capabilities, enabling us to gather critical feedback on where we are headed over the next 1-2 years. The rapid and accelerating pace of AI innovation also supports us planning ahead for the next 5-10 years — early interest in our AI Era Plan indicates our customers are ready.\n\nAlongside Draft One, we showcased additional AI use cases including Axon Body 4 Live Translation. Axon Body 4 Live Translation utilizes Axon's cloud-connected body cameras to enable real-time translation between two speakers in over 100 languages, removing language barriers, fostering relationships and enhancing transparency. This feature is made possible through the Axon ecosystem, which connects our devices to our advanced cloud software. We expect to make Axon Body 4 Live Translation available to AI Era Plan subscribers in the first half of 2025.\n\nWe are not stopping there. Our roadmap continues to expand, and our pace of innovation is accelerating. In addition to Draft One and Axon Body 4 Live translation, we previewed a suite of features in development for the AI Era Plan, including Evidence Translation, Form One, Brief One, Smart Capture, Policy Chat, and CAD Q&A. We also continue to improve existing features and products, including recent enhancements to our redaction tools delivering an estimated 70% time savings from our earlier generation Redaction Assistant.\n\n_\"We've seen**65-75% time savings** just by being able to push a button to get a transcript.\"_— Lieutenant Steve Ferrie, Rowlett Police Department\n\n_\"...one of the**biggest, [most] exciting changes in technology in policing** that I have seen...\"_— Chief Steve Redfearn, Boulder Police Department\n\n_\"We spend a lot of time thinking about what could go wrong. But we also need to think about what could go right.**Can we do better than today?** \"__— Rick Smith, Axon Founder and CEO_\n\n  * _67% decrease in time spent writing incident reports — Fort Collins Police Department with Draft One_\n  *  _32 minutes stolen vehicle recovery — Cobb County Police Department with Fusus AI Image Search_\n  *  _75% decrease in time spent redacting evidence — Rowlett Police Department with Redaction Assistant_\n  *  _400+ unauthorized drone detections — at Tulsa State Fair with Dedrone by Axon_\n  *  _1 camera = equivalent of 5 officers searching for vehicle — Fairfax County Police Department with Fleet 3 ALPR_\n\n\n\n _The statistics related to Axon AI, such as time savings and productivity improvements, reflect data from select customer use cases and specific implementations. These results are not guaranteed and may vary based on a range of factors unique to each customer, including but not limited to the nature of their operations, the specific configurations of Axon AI products, and the integration of AI tools within their workflows. Actual outcomes depend on each customer's operational environment, training, and level of adoption. As with any technology deployment, results will vary, and customers may experience different levels of efficiency and effectiveness._\n\n**Axon Air — Drone as First Responder** Axon's innovative momentum extends beyond AI into drones and robotics, where we are leading the way to power drone as first responder (DFR) operations. We are thrilled to announce the closing of our acquisition of Dedrone, bringing integrated airspace security technology — including comprehensive protection, detection, identification and mitigation of unauthorized drones in restricted airspace — into the Axon DFR solution.\n\nAlong with Dedrone, Axon's DFR offering has continued to advance through our unmatched partnerships with Skydio and DroneSense. Together, our DFR solution includes U.S.-made drone hardware and a newly introduced autonomous docking solution from Skydio, enabling fully remote-controlled launches, landings, recharging and airspace deconfliction for beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations. In addition, our DFR solution integrates into Fusus, which provides unified situational awareness by allowing agencies to monitor live drone feeds, share footage and streamline coordinated responses. This combination positions us as the leader in powering scalable, end-to-end DFR operations.\n\nThe differentiated capabilities of our DFR offering are evidenced by the Campbell Police Department in California recently receiving a first-of-its-kind waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for BVLOS operations as part of its DFR program. Their approval includes nighttime operations, enabling 24/7 drone use, and allows the department to fly missions without the need for visual observers. We are excited to enable this ground-breaking advancement in DFR operations as we continue to invest in this market opportunity.\n\n_\"This FAA approval is a major milestone for our department and our community. With the ability to conduct drone operations day or night without the need for visual observers, we can respond faster and more effectively to emergencies, improving both officer and public safety.**This technology is a game changer in ensuring we have the tools to support our community when it matters most**.\"_— Chief Gary Berg, Campbell Police Department\n\n**Axon Aid — Partnering with first responders to support heroic efforts** Axon is steadfast in our commitment to supporting first responders and the communities they serve. Helping our customers achieve better outcomes is at the center of everything we do. This is especially true in times of crisis. When hurricanes Helene and Milton devastated communities across the Southeast U.S., thousands were left grappling with extensive damage. Heroic first responders worked tirelessly around the clock conducting search and rescue missions, restoring power, and providing essential resources — all while overcoming significant communication challenges.\n\nSupporting their efforts, Axon Aid partnered with agencies, regardless of whether they were Axon customers, to assist in post-disaster assessments and recovery support at no cost. The Axon Aid emergency response team supported missions across four states, assisting more than 10 agencies and communities in what became Axon Aid's longest deployment effort to date, spanning more than 16 days. Axon is proud to play a small part in supporting our first responders on these critical missions, and we are inspired by their dedication to public safety and their communities in times of need. \n\n_\"During Hurricane Helene in Fairview, I worked in conjunction with Axon Aid to enhance drone operations, coordinating real-time aerial footage to assess damage and improve resource allocation. This experience demonstrated the**effectiveness of integrating drone surveillance with Axon systems for rapid decision-making during emergency response**.\"_ — Firefighter with Graham Fire Department\n\n**Q3 2024 Summary Results**\n\n**Quarterly revenue** of $544 million grew 32% year over year, exceeding our expectations, driven by growth in each of our product segments. Demand for our latest TASER and body camera products remained strong, driving growth in TASER and Sensors & Other revenue, while adoption of premium software offerings continued to fuel growth in Axon Cloud & Services.\n\n**Total company gross margin** of 60.8% declined 130 basis points year over year, driven by increased stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangibles in our cost of goods sold (COGS). Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation and intangibles amortization, non-GAAP company gross margin of 63.2% increased 50 basis points year over year.\n\n**Operating profit** of $24 million decreased from $57 million year over year primarily due to increased stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense of $102 million included $60 million of expenses related to broad-based equity incentive programs due to expected achievement of operational and time based service components.\n\n  * COGS of $214 million, 39.2% of revenue, included $10 million in stock-based compensation expense.\n  * SG&A expense of $192 million, 35.3% of revenue, included $55 million in stock-based compensation expense.\n  * R&D expense of $114 million, 21.0% of revenue, included $36 million in stock-based compensation expense.\n\n\n\n**Net income** of $67 million (12.3% net income margin), or $0.86 per diluted share, supported non-GAAP net income of $113 million (20.8% non-GAAP net income margin), or $1.45 per diluted share.\n\n**Adjusted EBITDA** of $145 million (26.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin) increased 54% year over year driven by higher revenue and operating leverage.\n\n**Operating cash flow** of $91 million increased 45% year over year, supporting free cash flow of $65 million and adjusted free cash flow of $68 million.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, Axon had $1.01 billion in **cash, cash equivalents and investments** , and outstanding convertible notes in principal amount of $690 million, for a net cash position of $317 million, up $38 million sequentially.\n\n_During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we revised our previously issued financial statements from 2021 through the second quarter of 2024 to reflect the impact of corrections of certain errors that we concluded were not material to any previously issued financial statements. For additional information related to this revision, see Note 1 to our condensed consolidated financial statements of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which we expect to be available on November 8, 2024._\n\n_Detailed definitions of our non-GAAP financial measures and caution on the use of non-GAAP measures are included later in this letter_.\n\n**Financial commentary by segment**\n\n**Software & Sensors**  \n---  \n**THREE MONTHS ENDED** | **CHANGE**  \n**30 SEP 2024** | **30 JUN 2024** | **30 SEP 2023** | **QoQ** | **YoY**  \n_(in thousands)_  \nAxon Cloud & Services revenue(1) | $202,514 | $ 196,499 | $149,028 | 3.1 % | 35.9 %  \nAxon Cloud & Services gross margin | 72.3 % | 73.1 % | 72.7 % |  (80) bp |  (40) bp  \nAxon Cloud & Services adjusted gross margin | 75.2 % | 75.7 % | 73.7 % |  (50) bp |  150 bp  \nSensors & Other revenue | $120,026 | $ 110,019 | $101,680 | 9.1 % | 18.0 %  \nSensors & Other gross margin | 41.4 % | 39.9 % | 46.0 % |  150 bp |  (460) bp  \nSensors & Other adjusted gross margin | 43.3 % | 41.1 % | 46.5 % |  220 bp |  (320) bp  \n  \n(1) | The TASER segment includes Cloud and Services revenue, which is not included here.  \n---|---  \n  \n  * Axon Cloud & Services revenue growth of 36% year over year was primarily driven by new customer adoption of Axon Evidence and expansion with existing customers adopting premium software offerings.\n  * Axon Cloud & Services gross margin of 72.3% decreased from 72.7% year over year. Excluding the impacts of stock-based compensation expense and intangibles amortization, Axon Cloud & Services adjusted gross margin of 75.2% increased from 73.7% year over year primarily due to a higher software mix revenue relative to professional services.

Growth in annual recurring revenue is primarily driven by new users adopting our cloud products and upgrades to premium offerings.\n  * Net revenue retention accelerated to 123% in the quarter, reflecting our ability to deliver additional value to our customers over time and de minimis attrition. We drive adoption of our cloud software solutions through integrated subscription plans, which include a variety of premium software options. This Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) metric excludes the hardware portion of customer subscriptions and is normalized to account for phased customer deployments throughout the year.\n  * Total company future contracted revenue of $7.7 billion increased sequentially and is up 33% year over year. We expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years.\n\n\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nThe following forward-looking statements reflect Axon's expectations as of November 7, 2024, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to \"Forward-looking Statements\" below for more information.\n\n**Q4 2024**\n\n  * For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue within the range of $560 million to $570 million, representing greater than 30% annual growth at the midpoint.\n  * We expect Adjusted EBITDA within the range of $130 million to $135 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 23.5%.\n    * We provide Adjusted EBITDA guidance, rather than net income guidance, due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting certain types of expenses and gains such as stock-based compensation, income tax expenses and gains or losses on marketable securities and strategic investments, which affect net income but not Adjusted EBITDA. We are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of such expenses, which could be material, on net income. Accordingly, we do not provide a reconciliation of projected net income to projected Adjusted EBITDA.\n\n\n\n**Full Year**\n\n  * Axon's full year 2024 revenue expectation has improved to approximately $2.07 billion, representing greater than 32% annual growth. This is an increase from our prior revenue guidance range of $2.00 billion to $2.05 billion, or 29.5% annual growth at the midpoint.\n  * Axon expects full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA dollars of approximately $510 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 24.6%. This is an increase from our prior Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $460 million to $475 million, which implied Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 23.1%\n  * We expect stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $360 million to $380 million, up from $355 million to $370 million previously. Because our stock-based compensation expense may vary based on changes in our stock price or the actual timing of attainment of certain metrics, it is inherently difficult to forecast future stock-based compensation expense.\n    * Full year stock-based compensation expense includes approximately $210 million for broad-based equity compensation programs and a one-time enhanced equity compensation program provided to employees whose compensation is under a specific threshold. Approximately $170 million in full year expected stock-based compensation expense, primarily in SG&A and R&D, is related to the broad-based 2024 eXponential Stock Plan and the 2024 CEO Performance Award approved by our shareholders in May 2024. These performance-based incentive programs are achieved through stock price, operational and time-based requirements and are divided into seven substantially equal tranches. As of September 30, 2024, we have recognized expenses related to some tranches where we currently deem achievement to be probable. Approximately $43 million in expense, primarily in COGS, is related to a one-time enhanced equity compensation program provided to employees whose compensation is under a specified threshold.\n  * We expect 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $80 million to $95 million, unchanged from prior quarters. Our 2024 CapEx plans include investments in TASER 10 automation and capacity expansion, including cartridge capacity, global facility build-out and upgrades, such as warehousing support for global shipping facilities.\n\n\n\n**_Quarterly conference call and webcast_** We will host our Q3 2024 earnings conference call webinar on Thursday, November 7, at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET.\n\nThe webcast will be available via a link on Axon's investor relations website at <https://investor.axon.com> or can be accessed directly via <https://axon.zoom.us/j/98297372356>.\n\n**_Statistical Definitions_** Annual recurring revenue: Annual recurring revenue is a performance indicator that management believes provides more visibility into the growth of our revenue generated by our highest margin, recurring services. Annual recurring revenue should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue because it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace GAAP revenue or deferred revenue, as they can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. Annual recurring revenue is not intended to be a replacement or forecast of revenue or deferred revenue. We calculate annual recurring revenue as monthly recurring license, integration, warranty, and storage revenue, annualized.\n\nNet revenue retention: Dollar-based net revenue retention is an important metric to measure our ability to retain and expand our relationships with existing customers. We calculate it as the software, camera and TASER warranty subscription and support revenue from a base set of agency customers from which we generated Axon Cloud subscription and warranty revenue in the last month of a quarter divided by the software and camera warranty subscription and support revenue from the year-ago month of that same customer base. This calculation includes high-margin warranty revenue but purposely excludes the lower-margin hardware subscription component of the customer contracts, as it is meant to be a SaaS metric that we use to monitor the health of the recurring revenue business we are building. This calculation also excludes the implied monthly revenue contribution of customers that were added since the year-ago quarter, and therefore excludes the benefit of new customer acquisition. The metric includes customers, if any, that terminated during the annual period, and therefore, this metric is inclusive of customer churn. This metric is downwardly adjusted to account for the effect of phased deployments — meaning that, for the year-ago period, we consider the total contractually obligated implied monthly revenue amount, rather than monthly revenue amounts that might have been in actuality smaller on a GAAP basis due to the customer not having yet fully deployed their Axon solution. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nTotal company future contracted revenue: Total company future contracted revenue represents remaining performance obligations and includes both recognized contract liabilities as well as amounts that are expected to be invoiced and recognized in future periods. The remaining performance obligations are limited only to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 as of September 30, 2024. We currently expect to recognize between 15% to 25% of this balance over the next 12 months, and generally expect the remainder to be recognized over the following ten years, subject to risks related to delayed deployments, budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses.\n\n**_Non-GAAP Measures_** To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Gross Margin, Non-GAAP Net Income, Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share, Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented below.\n\n  * EBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: net income) - Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA (most comparable GAAP measure: net income) - Earnings before interest expense, investment interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities, transaction costs related to acquisitions and strategic investments, and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (identified and listed below in the reconciliation).\n  * Adjusted EBITDA margin (most comparable GAAP measure: net income margin) – Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\n  * Adjusted gross margin (most comparable GAAP measure: gross margin) – Gross margin before noncash stock-based compensation expense and amortization of acquired intangible assets.\n  * Non-GAAP net income (most comparable GAAP measure: net income) - Net income excluding the costs of non-cash stock-based compensation, gain/loss/write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; fair value adjustments to strategic investments and marketable securities; transaction costs related to acquisitions and strategic investments; costs related to antitrust litigation and other unusual, non-recurring pre-tax items that are not considered representative of our underlying operating performance (listed below). The Company tax-effects non-GAAP adjustments using the blended statutory federal and state tax rates for each period presented.\n  * Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (most comparable GAAP measure: earnings per share) - Measure of Company's Non-GAAP Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding during the period presented.\n  * Free cash flow (most comparable GAAP measure: cash flow from operating activities) - Cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets.\n  * Adjusted free cash flow (most comparable GAAP measure: cash flow from operating activities) - Cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding the net impact of investments in our new Scottsdale, Arizona campus and bond premium amortization.\n    * We believe that free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow excluding the impact of bond premium amortization and net campus investment are non-GAAP measures that are useful to investors and management to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash. These non-GAAP measures can also be used to evaluate the Company's ability to generate cash flow from operations and the impact that this cash flow has on the Company's liquidity.\n\n\n\n**Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:\n\n  * these non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's GAAP financial measures;\n  * these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures;\n  * these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and\n  * these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP or under a comprehensive set of rules or principles proposed by a third party.\n\n\n\nFurther, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies.\n\n**_About Axon_** Axon is a technology leader in global public safety.

Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"future,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. However, not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words.\n\nWe cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized, although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions. The following important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: our exposure to cancellations of government contracts due to non-appropriation clauses, exercise of a cancellation clause, or non-exercise of contractually optional periods; the ability of law enforcement agencies to obtain funding, including based on tax revenues; our ability to design, introduce and sell new products, services or features; our ability to defend against litigation and protect our intellectual property, and the resulting costs of this activity; our ability to win bids through the open bidding process for governmental agencies; our ability to manage our supply chain and avoid production delays, shortages and impacts to expected gross margins; the impacts of inflation, macroeconomic conditions and global events; the impact of catastrophic events or public health emergencies; the impact of stock-based compensation expense, impairment expense, and income tax expense on our financial results; customer purchase behavior, including adoption of our software as a service delivery model; negative media publicity or sentiment regarding our products; the impact of various factors on projected gross margins; defects in, or misuse of, our products; changes in the costs of product components and labor; loss of customer data, a breach of security, or an extended outage, including by our third party cloud-based storage providers; exposure to international operational risks; delayed cash collections and possible credit losses due to our subscription model; changes in government regulations in the United States and in foreign markets, especially related to the classification of our products by the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; the impact of declines in the fair values or impairment of our investments, including our strategic investments; our ability to attract and retain key personnel; litigation or inquiries and related time and costs; and counter-party risks relating to cash balances held in excess of federally insured limits. Many events beyond our control may determine whether results we anticipate will be achieved. Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements. Our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30 2024, which we expect to be available on November 8, 2024, lists various important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These factors are intended as cautionary statements for investors within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Readers can find them in Part II, Item 1A under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q, and investors should refer to them. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider any such list to be a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties.\n\nExcept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 8-K, 10‑Q and 10‑K reports to the SEC.
