(Nasdaq: CMMB) (Chemomab), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing innovative therapeutics for fibro-inflammatory diseases with high unmet need, today announced that data from its Phase 2 SPRING trial in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) was presented at the [American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) The Liver Meeting® 2024](https://www.aasld.org/the-liver-meeting).\n\nIn the oral, late-breaking presentation, “ _CM-101 improved fibrosis biomarkers in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis: The Phase 2 SPRING Study,”_ Professor Christopher Bowlus, MD**,** FAASLD, a SPRING trial investigator and the Lena Valente Professor and Chief of the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology at the University of California Davis School of Medicine, discussed data from the double-blinded, placebo-controlled portion of the Phase 2 SPRING trial assessing CM-101 in patients with PSC.\n\nThe Phase 2 SPRING study tested two doses of CM-101 (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) administered to PSC patients every three weeks over 15 weeks. A total of 76 patients were treated in the trial. The study analysis included assessments of all patients who completed all doses and the week 15 visit, as well as a prespecified subgroup analysis of moderate/advanced patients with a higher risk of more rapidly progressing disease.\n\nCM-101 met the SPRING trial primary endpoint, demonstrating a favorable safety profile over the 15-week treatment period. Adverse events were generally mild/moderate and distributed similarly between the placebo and CM-101-treated dosing arms. Overall, dose-dependent responses were observed for multiple disease-related biomarker secondary endpoints. A consistent pattern of greater improvement on the secondary endpoints was observed in the study arm receiving the higher 20 mg/kg dose of CM-101 and in the subgroup of PSC patients with moderate/advanced disease. Secondary endpoint data included the following:\n\n  * Liver stiffness: Liver stiffness measured by FibroScan® improved in all CM-101 treated patients compared to placebo and significantly improved in CM-101-treated patients with moderate/advanced disease. \n  * ELF scores: This composite score consistently improved over the treatment period in patients with moderate/advanced fibrosis treated with 20 mg/kg of CM-101 compared to patients receiving placebo. Patients receiving the higher dose of CM-101 with moderate/advanced disease also showed statistically significant reductions at week 15 in the fibrosis-related ELF components procollagen III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). \n  * PRO-C3: This serum biomarker of type III collagen synthesis was reduced in all CM-101-treated patients and showed greater reductions in patients with moderate- advanced disease. \n  * Liver biochemistries: A consistent pattern of decline was seen in CM-101 20 mg/kg treated-patients compared to placebo and a greater decline was seen in patients with moderate/advanced disease. \n  * Bilirubin: The dose-dependent improvement in total bilirubin levels seen in CM-101-treated patients provides evidence for the anti-cholestatic activity of CM-101. \n  * Pruritis (itch): CM-101-treated patients experienced decreased pruritus scores across all timepoints compared to placebo.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, Dr. Bowlus noted that CM-101 was well tolerated and had a safety profile comparable to placebo, and it demonstrated dose-dependent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-cholestatic effects in patients with PSC. PSC patients with moderate to advanced disease treated with CM-101 showed broad and consistent improvement in biomarkers associated with clinical outcomes. He concluded that these findings support further clinical development of CM-101 in patients with PSC.\n\nDr. Bowlus commented, “In the Phase 2 SPRING trial, CM-101 demonstrated that it has the potential to change the lives of patients with PSC by reducing fibrosis and cholestasis, which should lead to improved outcomes. CM-101 may also provide patients with relief of symptoms. This promising clinical data and Chemomab’s intention to advance CM-101 into a registrational trial is good news for patients with PSC, who are in desperate need of an effective, FDA approved therapy.”\n\nMatt Frankel, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Chemomab, noted, “CM-101 is the first investigative therapy for PSC to demonstrate such broad activity across a range of biomarkers representing all major components of the disease. We welcomed the opportunity to present the promising data from the CM-101 Phase 2 SPRING study at this major scientific conference and look forward to meeting with the FDA before the end of the year to agree on a path forward to a PSC registrational trial. We expect to report on the outcome of our discussions with the FDA in the first quarter of 2025 and potentially to launch a CM-101 PSC registrational trial before the end of next year.”\n\nAn open label extension portion of the Phase 2 SPRING trial, in which all eligible patients can receive CM-101 for an additional 33 weeks, is continuing, with results expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nA copy of Chemomab’s presentation at AASLD’s The Liver Meeting® 2024 is available at [chemomab.com/r-d/](http://www.chemomab.com/r-d/).\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, in particular, the statements regarding our resulting cash runway.

(Nasdaq: CMMB), (Chemomab), a clinical stage biotechnology company developing innovative therapeutics for fibro-inflammatory diseases with high unmet need, today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“These are exciting and transformational times for Chemomab,” said Adi Mor, PhD, co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of Chemomab. \"In the third quarter we reported the results of our CM-101 Phase 2 SPRING trial in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The positive data from this trial represents a major clinical proof-of-concept for CM-101 as a potential disease-modifying treatment for PSC and other fibro-inflammatory diseases.” \n\nWe are on track to complete two important milestones in the first quarter of 2025—first, agreement with the FDA on the design of a PSC pivotal trial for CM-101 and second, reporting new clinical data from the open label portion of the Phase 2 SPRING trial. We will be meeting with the FDA before the end of this year to discuss the design of a CM-101 registrational trial in patients with PSC. Based on recent developments, we are optimistic that our proposed design, which incorporates surrogate biomarkers as primary endpoints in a single pivotal study, will be accepted. This would be a significant development for Chemomab and for the PSC field. Importantly, in the Phase 2 SPRING trial, CM-101 demonstrated positive results across the surrogate biomarker endpoints under consideration, which may represent a significant de-risking as CM-101 advances into Phase 3. We look forward to sharing the outcome of these discussions with the FDA and the data from the open label portion of the SPRING trial in the first quarter of 2025.”\n\nDr. Mor added, “We currently are laying the groundwork for the PSC registrational trial, which we anticipate launching later in 2025. We continue to have active discussions with potential strategic partners, whose long-time interest in Chemomab and CM-101 has significantly ramped up since the release of our positive Phase 2 data. Our focus is on assessing options that would help accelerate the PSC clinical program, as well as our programs in systemic sclerosis and potentially other fibro-inflammatory diseases. Our goal is to maximize the value of our novel and unique asset for all our stakeholders and ensure that CM-101 is available to patients in need.”\n\nDr. Mor concluded, “We are excited that our Phase 2 SPRING trial data is the subject of a high profile late breaking oral presentation at the upcoming 2024 AASLD conference. Chemomab will be well-represented at this major scientific meeting, and we also will be available for meetings during the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in January.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 and Recent Updates**\n\n  * On October 15, 2024, Chemomab announced that on November 18, 2024, PSC expert Dr. Christopher Bowlus will be presenting a late-breaking oral presentation discussing the CM-101 PSC Phase 2 SPRING trial results at the AASLD The Liver Meeting® 2024. \n  * On July 30, 2024, Chemomab announced the closing of a private placement that resulted in gross proceeds of approximately $10 million to the company. Existing investors such as OrbiMed and new investors including HBM Partners and Sphera Biotech Master Fund participated in the financing. The financing extended the company’s runway through early 2026, after completion of the two major milestones expected in early 2025. \n  * On July 25, 2024, Chemomab reported topline results from the CM-101 Phase 2 SPRING trial in patients with PSC. CM-101 met the primary study endpoint, demonstrating a favorable safety profile over the 15-week treatment period. CM-101-treated patients with moderate/advanced disease showed improvements on a wide range of disease-related secondary endpoints, including assessments of changes from baseline relative to placebo at Week 15 in liver stiffness; in liver fibrosis biomarkers, including the Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score and PRO-C3 levels; in total bilirubin and liver function tests; in pruritus (itch) and in markers of inflammation. Dose-dependent responses were observed for multiple disease-related biomarkers. A consistent pattern of greater improvement on the secondary endpoints was observed in the study arm receiving the higher 20 mg/kg dose of CM-101. The open label extension portion of the Phase 2 SPRING trial is continuing, with results expected to be reported in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash Position and Liquidity** : Cash and short-term bank deposits were $19.5 million as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $12.8 million as of June 30, 2024 and $19.9 million as of December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024 Chemomab completed a private placement that resulted in gross proceeds to the company of approximately $10 million. Chemomab believes its existing liquidity resources as of September 30, 2024, will enable the company to fund its operations through the beginning of 2026. \n  * **Research and Development (R &D) Expenses**: R&D expenses were $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $3.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily resulted from the completion of the double-blinded portion of the company’s CM-101 Phase 2 PSC trial in the third quarter of 2024. \n  * **General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses**: G&A expenses were $0.9 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $1.0 million for the third quarter of 2023. \n  * **Net Loss** : Net loss was $3.5 million, or a net loss of approximately $0.01 per basic and diluted ordinary share for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $4.1 million, or a net loss of approximately $0.02 per basic and diluted ordinary share for the third quarter of 2023. The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, basic and diluted, was 350,643,531 (equal to approximately 17.5 million ADSs) for the third quarter of 2024. \n  * **Number of issued and outstanding shares** : As of September 30, 2024, following completion of its July 2024 financing, the company had 18,856,611 ADSs (representing 377,132,220 ordinary shares) issued and outstanding and 25,469,786 ADSs (representing 509,395,720 ordinary shares) outstanding on a fully diluted basis. \n\n\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements** This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that involve substantial risks and uncertainties, in particular, the statements regarding our resulting cash runway.
