Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices; Nvidia’s dominance in the graphics processing unit market and its aggressive business practices; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; market conditions of the industries in which AMD products are sold; loss of a significant customer; competitive markets in which AMD’s products are sold; economic and market uncertainty; quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; AMD's ability to adequately protect its technology or other intellectual property; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations; ability of third party manufacturers to manufacture AMD's products on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies; availability of essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes; ability to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products; AMD's ability to introduce products on a timely basis with expected features and performance levels; AMD's ability to generate revenue from its semi-custom SoC products; potential security vulnerabilities; potential security incidents including IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products; AMD’s reliance on third-party intellectual property to design and introduce new products; AMD's reliance on third-party companies for design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components; AMD's reliance on Microsoft and other software vendors' support to design and develop software to run on AMD’s products; AMD’s reliance on third-party distributors and add-in-board partners; impact of modification or interruption of AMD’s internal business processes and information systems; compatibility of AMD’s products with some or all industry-standard software and hardware; costs related to defective products; efficiency of AMD's supply chain; AMD's ability to rely on third party supply-chain logistics functions; AMD’s ability to effectively control sales of its products on the gray market; long-term impact of climate change on AMD’s business; impact of government actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs and trade protection measures; AMD’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets; potential tax liabilities; current and future claims and litigation; impact of environmental laws, conflict minerals related provisions and other laws or regulations; evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters; issues related to the responsible use of AI; restrictions imposed by agreements governing AMD’s notes, the guarantees of Xilinx’s notes and the revolving credit agreement; the ability to obtain applicable regulatory approvals for the acquisition of ZT Systems in a timely manner or otherwise and to satisfy other closing conditions to the transaction; impact of acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments on AMD’s business and AMD’s ability to integrate acquired businesses; impact of any impairment of the combined company’s assets; political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters; future impairments of technology license purchases; AMD’s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and AMD’s stock price volatility. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. \n\n(*) | In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses/revenue%, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2024, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and free cash flow margin as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of October 29, 2024 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related and other costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.  \n---|---  \n  \n**_©2024 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, and acquisition-related and other costs. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.\n\n(3) | **Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow**  \n---|---  \nThree Months Ended | Nine Months Ended  \n---|---  \n(Millions except percentages) (Unaudited) | September 28,2024 | June 29,2024 | September 30,2023 | September 28,2024 | September 30,2023  \nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 628 | $ | 593 | $ | 421 | $ | 1,742 | $ | 1,286  \n_Operating cash flow margin %_ | _9_ | _%_ | _10_ | _%_ | _7_ | _%_ | _10_ | _%_ | _8_ | _%_  \nPurchases of property and equipment | (132 | ) | (154 | ) | (124 | ) | (428 | ) | (407 | )  \nFree cash flow | $ | 496 | $ | 439 | $ | 297 | $ | 1,314 | $ | 879  \n_Free cash flow margin %_ | _7_ | _%_ | _8_ | _%_ | _5_ | _%_ | _7_ | _%_ | _5_ | _%_  \n  \nThe Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/9782a337-07ac-424b-9c5a-f9cde47d8d55/small/amd-logo-black-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9782a337-07ac-424b-9c5a-f9cde47d8d55)\n\nSource: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nReleased October 29, 2024\n"

AMD focuses its efforts on key issues that have the greatest impact on its business and society, determined through an ESG materiality assessment1, including environmental sustainability; digital impact; diversity, belonging and inclusion; and supply chain responsibility.\n\n“We are in the midst of a major inflection point in the computing industry, and it is more important than ever to put our values into action and align our efforts with some of the biggest challenges facing our world, including addressing climate change and energy demand, enabling advancements in science and medicine, and respecting human rights,” said Justin Murrill, director of Corporate Responsibility at AMD. “At AMD, we continue to deepen collaboration with partners and peers to address these important issues and responsibly drive our industry forward.”\n\nKey highlights from 2023 include:**Advancing Environmental Sustainability**\n\n  * Through a holistic approach to chip design centered on performance and energy efficiency, AMD [delivers](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/environmental-sustainability.html) a broad range of compute engines for end-to-end AI infrastructure. Innovations like the chiplet architecture AMD pioneered can address sustainability challenges during product use as well as in the manufacturing process. For instance, producing 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ CPUs with up to 12 separate compute chiplets instead of one monolithic die saved ~132,000 metric tons of CO2e in 2023 through avoidance of wafers manufactured, 2.8x the annual operational CO2e footprint of AMD in 2023, and 4.9x the water use of AMD operations in 20232. AMD also continues to make progress on its [goal](https://community.amd.com/t5/corporate/how-amd-is-advancing-the-30x25-energy-efficiency-goal-in-high/ba-p/650223) to deliver 30x energy efficiency improvement for processors and accelerators powering servers for HPC and AI training from 2020 to 2025, and AMD solutions power more than half of the top 50 most energy efficient supercomputers on the latest [Green500 list](https://top500.org/lists/green500/2024/06/).\n  * AMD designs AI and high-performance computing to help customers and partners tackle some of the world’s toughest challenges while achieving their sustainability goals. As AI becomes the dominant workload, AMD solutions are helping data center operators modernize their infrastructure to address space and power challenges. For example, a single 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ server can replace five legacy servers, reducing rack space by 70% while consuming 65% less energy3.\n  * Across its operations, AMD has reduced carbon emissions 24.5% since 2020. In 2023, AMD sourced 40% of its energy used from renewable sources, up from 18% in 2020. In the supply chain, AMD foundry partners reduced total water withdrawals from wafer manufacturing by increasing recycled water use by 34% (2022-2023). \n\n\n\n**Accelerating Scientific Research and STEM Education**\n\n  * Since 2020, more than 150 universities, research institutions and non-profit organizations [have received](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/digital-impact.html) donated AMD technology through the AMD AI and HPC Fund and STEM initiatives, benefiting approximately 61 million people through scientific research and education.4 As part of these efforts, in 2023, AMD made donations to institutions working in areas such as AI and Machine Learning systems and applications research, incorporating AI in scientific applications and various HPC and AI teaching and training initiatives.\n  * The company also continues to expand STEM education with the AMD Learning Labs program and established a new lab at Maynooth University in Dublin, Ireland. In addition to technology and funding, AMD employees around the world provide mentoring and hands-on learning with students through a variety of programs and events.\n\n\n\n**Empowering People and Communities**\n\n  * AMD [empowers](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/diversity-belonging-inclusion.html) employees to do their most impactful work, supported by opportunities for development, engagement and belonging. Driven by these efforts, in the 2023 AMDer Survey, 92% of employees said AMD creates an environment where people of diverse backgrounds can succeed.\n  * In 2023, AMD launched Advancing Women in Tech, a comprehensive learning experience designed to empower, retain and support AMD women in technical careers. The program was completed by over 230 women in its inaugural year and is expanding with additional cohorts in 2024. AMD also welcomed its first cohort of veterans through the Hiring our Heroes program in 2023.\n  * AMDers around the world [logged](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/community.html) over 25,000 hours of volunteer time through individual and team-based activities throughout 2023. \n\n\n\n**Collaborating Across the Value Chain**\n\n  * AMD [cultivates](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/corporate-responsibility/supply-chain-responsibility.html) strong partnerships across its value chain and carefully selected manufacturing partners to advance human rights, environmental sustainability and supply chain resilience. In 2023, AMD expanded due diligence efforts to mitigate adverse impacts to human rights where possible, including additional responsible minerals due diligence. Aligned to the company’s goals, 84% of AMD Manufacturing Suppliers had Responsible Business Alliance audits between 2020-2023.5\n  * AMD continues to work closely with suppliers to expand education and resources on environmental and human rights issues. Over the last three years, 95% of AMD Manufacturing Suppliers across Malaysia, Taiwan and Japan that work with labor agents to recruit migrant workers have attended the RBA Forced Labor Prevention workshop.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about these and other Corporate Responsibility updates, explore the full 2023-24 CR Report [here](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/corporate/cr/corporate-responsibility-report.pdf).\n\nAMD prepared this year’s report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards.

Our ESG Materials may contain information that is significant; however, any significance should not be read as necessarily rising to the level of the definition of materiality used for the purposes of our compliance with reporting requirements, including the U.S. federal securities laws, even where we use the word “material” or “materiality” in our ESG Materials (including where we use it in connection with our materiality assessment) or in other materials issued in connection with the matters discussed in our ESG Materials. We have used definitions of materiality in the course of creating our ESG Materials and the goals and metrics discussed therein that do not coincide with or rise to the level of the definition of materiality used for the purposes of our compliance with the U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, given the uncertainties, estimates, and assumptions inherent in the matters discussed in our ESG Materials, and the timelines involved, materiality is inherently difficult to assess far in advance. In addition, given the inherent uncertainty of the estimates, assumptions and timelines associated with the matters discussed in our ESG Materials, we may not be able to anticipate in advance whether or the degree to which we will or will not be able to meet our plans, targets or goals.2 AMD estimation based on defect density (defects per unit area on the wafer), chip area and n-factor (manufacturing complexity factor) to estimate the number of wafers avoided in one year. Yield = (1 + A*D0)^(-n) where A is the chip area, D0 is the defect density and n is the complexity factor. The area is known from our design, D0 is known based our manufacturing yield data, and n is a number provided by a foundry partner for a given technology. The calculations are not meant to be precise, since chip design can have a large influence on yield, but it estimates the area impact on yield. The carbon emission estimates of 132,064 mtCO2e were calculated using the estimated number of 5 nm wafers saved in one year, based on the TechInsights’ Semiconductor Manufacturing Carbon Model. Comparison to AMD corporate footprint is based on AMD reported scope 1 and 2 market-based GHG emissions in 2023: 46,606 mtCO2e. Water savings estimates of 1,110 million liters were calculated using the estimated number of 5 nm wafers saved in one year times the amount of water use per 300mm wafer mask layer times the average number of mask layers. Comparison to AMD corporate water use is based on AMD 2023 reported value of 225 million liters. 3 SP5TCO-022B: As of 02/28/2023 based on AMD Internal analysis using the AMD EPYC™ Bare Metal Server & Greenhouse Gas Emission TCO Estimation Tool - version 8.22, estimating the cost and quantity of 2P AMD EPYC™ 9654 (96 core/CPU) powered server versus 2P Intel® Xeon® Platinum 8130 (28 core/CPU) based server solutions required to deliver 380 total virtual machines (VM), requiring 1 core and 8GB of memory per VM. Environmental impact estimates made leveraging this data, using the Country / Region specific electricity factors from the '2020 Grid Electricity Emissions Factors v1.4 – September 2020', and the United States Environmental Protection Agency 'Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator'.This scenario contains many assumptions and estimates and, while based on AMD internal research and best approximations, should be considered an example for information purposes only, and not used as a basis for decision making over actual testing. For additional details, see https://www.amd.com/en/claims/epyc4#SP5TCO-022B.4 The time period for the Digital Impact goal includes donations made after January 1, 2020 and initiated by December 31, 2025. “Initiated” is defined as AMD and the recipient organization reaching an agreement on an AMD donation, which must be delivered by July 30, 2026. Reported data includes: direct beneficiaries defined as students, faculty, or researchers with direct access to AMD-donated technology, funding, or volunteers; and indirect beneficiaries defined as individuals with a reasonable likelihood of receiving research data formulated through AMD-donated technology and potentially gaining useful insights or knowledge. AMD conducts annual surveys with recipient organizations to estimate direct beneficiaries, and in the case of the AI & HPC Fund, indirect beneficiaries as well. To address gaps and/or inconsistencies in survey responses, AMD uses an economic-based impact assumption to estimate the total number of indirect beneficiaries (not applied to direct beneficiaries) by dividing the total market-value of donations in a given years by the total reported indirect beneficiary values from recipients’ surveys for the same year. The data shows the ratio is 1.08 on average for the 3 years of data available (2021, 2022, 2023). Therefore, AMD assumes for every $1M USD of market-value donated, approximately 1.08 million people will indirectly benefit. AMD also assumes that the annual estimated indirect beneficiaries in year 1 continues to reach additional individuals in year 2 and year 3, but at a reduced rate. The impact depreciation rate assumes year 2 beneficiaries amount to 50% of year 1 estimates, and year 3 beneficiaries amount to 25% of year 1 estimates. AMD goal calculations are third-party verified (limited level assurance) based on data supplied by recipient organizations, which is not independently verified by AMD, and AMD economic-based impact models based on data supplied by recipient organizations.5 AMD calculations are third-party verified (limited level assurance) based on data supplied by our Manufacturing Suppliers, which is not independently verified by AMD.\n\n**Contact:****Sarah Feller** AMD Communications(512) 574-5583sarah.feller@amd.com\n\n**Suresh Bhaskaran** AMD Investor Relations408-749-2845suresh.bhaskaran@amd.com\n\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at <https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c432ad8c-4581-49eb-9d9e-9cb11379971f>\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/9782a337-07ac-424b-9c5a-f9cde47d8d55/small/amd-logo-black-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9782a337-07ac-424b-9c5a-f9cde47d8d55)\n\n##### AMD Publishes 2023-24 Corporate Responsibility Report\n\n[![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/c432ad8c-4581-49eb-9d9e-9cb11379971f/medium/amd-publishes-2023-24-corporate-responsibility-report.png) ](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/c432ad8c-4581-49eb-9d9e-9cb11379971f/en)\n\n##### AMD is driving progress toward its strategic corporate responsibility goals aligned with some of the world’s most important challenges, including addressing climate change and energy demand, enabling advancements in science and medicine, and respecting human rights. \n\nSource: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nReleased August 21, 2024\n"

Ltd.](https://sunsingapore.com), the largest smart parking solutions provider in Singapore, is deploying a new AI-based smart parking solution, powered by [AMD Zynq™ UltraScale+™ MPSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html) devices. The intelligent solution improves the accuracy of vehicle license plate recognition and enables advanced features like parking spot vacancy detection, lane jam, accident detection, and parking violation enforcement.\n\nSun Singapore's new AI-based smart parking system uses [PlanetSpark](https://planetspark.io/the-innovation-centre/platforms/platform-xilinx-planetspark-edgeai-box-x7/)’s EdgeAI Box X7, which is powered by FPGA-based AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs. Aupera Technologies also helped design and develop FPGA firmware and AI vision solutions for accurate license plate reading. The resulting solution provides low latency, energy efficiency, and real-time AI inferencing at the edge. FPGAs provide the long lifecycle demanded by edge devices, with the hardware flexibility to adapt to changing AI models, algorithms and evolving demands and standards.\n\n“With our focus on durability, low latency and flexibility, the AMD FPGA-based edge AI solution, with its proven ability to support complex calculations on large amounts of data, was the right choice for us,” said Eddie Ng, senior sales manager, Sun Singapore. “The adaptability of the new edge AI solution will also allow us to deliver new applications to improve car parking system features and services for our customers.”\n\n“PlanetSpark is committed to driving sustainable innovation with our Green & Agile solutions, providing unmatched energy efficiency and performance at the edge,” said Ms. Phuay Li Ying, Managing Director, PlanetSpark. “We are delighted to work with AMD on this solution, which will bring significant improvements to the Smart Parking market.”\n\nCurrently, the technology inside most electronic parking systems in Singapore is more than two decades old. Legacy infrastructure lacks AI inferencing which can deliver more system functions and features. This new solution will enhance the system greatly, allowing the data generated through AI to provide advanced reporting to car park operators.\n\nWith the AMD solution utilizing the most up-to-date technology, enabling license plate reading accuracy of 99% as well as updated parking spot vacancy detection and parking violation enforcement, Sun Singapore is now able to provide a total solution for smart parking.\n\n“Sun Singapore and PlanetSpark exemplify the power of AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC’s ability to enable access to sensor fusion applications,” said Chetan Khona, senior director of Industrial, Vision, Healthcare and Sciences Markets, AMD. “By processing data from a variety of inputs, customers can leverage AI to enhance processes we take for granted across a variety of applications, be it smart city, manufacturing, robotics, and beyond.”\n\n**Supporting Resources**\n\n  * Learn more about the [AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html)\n  * Read the AMD case study on [Sun Singapore](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/resources/case-studies/sun-singapore-case-study.pdf)\n  * Read the AMD case study on [PlanetSpark](https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/resources/case-studies/planetspark-case-study.pdf)\n  * Follow AMD on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amd/)\n  * Follow AMD on [X](https://twitter.com/AMD)\n\n\n\n**About AMD** For more than 50 years AMD has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies.

(AMD) such as AMD’s expectations about revenue growth in the second half of 2024; AMD’s expectations about generative AI opportunities; AMD’s expectations about future growth; the features, functionality, performance, availability, timing and expected benefits of future AMD products; and AMD’s expected third quarter 2024 financial outlook, including revenue and non-GAAP gross margin, which are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are commonly identified by words such as \"would,\" \"may,\" \"expects,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"intends,\" \"projects\" and other terms with similar meaning. Investors are cautioned that the forward-looking statements in this press release are based on current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speak only as of the date of this press release and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Such statements are subject to certain known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond AMD's control, that could cause actual results and other future events to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied or projected by, the forward-looking information and statements. Material factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations include, without limitation, the following: Intel Corporation’s dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices; Nvidia’s dominance in the graphics processing unit market and its aggressive business practices; the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; market conditions of the industries in which AMD products are sold; loss of a significant customer; competitive markets in which AMD’s products are sold; economic and market uncertainty; quarterly and seasonal sales patterns; AMD's ability to adequately protect its technology or other intellectual property; unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations; ability of third party manufacturers to manufacture AMD's products on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies; availability of essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes; ability to achieve expected manufacturing yields for AMD’s products; AMD's ability to introduce products on a timely basis with expected features and performance levels; AMD's ability to generate revenue from its semi-custom SoC products; potential security vulnerabilities; potential security incidents including IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks; uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of AMD’s products; AMD’s reliance on third-party intellectual property to design and introduce new products; AMD's reliance on third-party companies for design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components; AMD's reliance on Microsoft and other software vendors' support to design and develop software to run on AMD’s products; AMD’s reliance on third-party distributors and add-in-board partners; impact of modification or interruption of AMD’s internal business processes and information systems; compatibility of AMD’s products with some or all industry-standard software and hardware; costs related to defective products; efficiency of AMD's supply chain; AMD's ability to rely on third party supply-chain logistics functions; AMD’s ability to effectively control sales of its products on the gray market; long-term impact of climate change on AMD’s business; impact of government actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs and trade protection measures; AMD’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets; potential tax liabilities; current and future claims and litigation; impact of environmental laws, conflict minerals related provisions and other laws or regulations; evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters; issues related to the responsible use of AI; restrictions imposed by agreements governing AMD’s notes, the guarantees of Xilinx’s notes and the revolving credit agreement; impact of acquisitions, joint ventures and/or investments on AMD’s business and AMD’s ability to integrate acquired businesses; impact of any impairment of the combined company’s assets; political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters; future impairments of technology license purchases; AMD’s ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; and AMD’s stock price volatility. Investors are urged to review in detail the risks and uncertainties in AMD’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings, including but not limited to AMD’s most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q.\n\n(*) | In this earnings press release, in addition to GAAP financial results, AMD has provided non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2024, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of July 30, 2024 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related and other costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.  \n---|---  \n

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization of acquisition-related intangibles), inventory loss at contract manufacturer, and acquisition-related and other costs. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows.\n\n(3) | **Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow**  \n---|---  \nThree Months Ended | Six Months Ended  \n---|---  \n(Millions except percentages) (Unaudited) | June 29,2024 | March 30,2024 | July 1,2023 | June 29,2024 | July 1,2023  \nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities | $ | 593 | $ | 521 | $ | 379 | $ | 1,114 | $ | 865  \n_Operating cash flow margin %_ | _10_ | _%_ | _10_ | _%_ | _7_ | _%_ | _10_ | _%_ | _8_ | _%_  \nPurchases of property and equipment | (154 | ) | (142 | ) | (125 | ) | (296 | ) | (283 | )  \nFree cash flow | $ | 439 | $ | 379 | $ | 254 | $ | 818 | $ | 582  \n_Free cash flow margin %_ | _8_ | _%_ | _7_ | _%_ | _5_ | _%_ | _7_ | _%_ | _5_ | _%_  \n  \nThe Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.\n\n**Media Contact:****Drew Prairie** AMD Communications512-602-4425drew.prairie@amd.com **Investor Contact:****Mitch Haws** AMD Investor Relations408-749-3124mitch.haws@amd.com\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/9782a337-07ac-424b-9c5a-f9cde47d8d55/small/amd-logo-black-jpg.jpg)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9782a337-07ac-424b-9c5a-f9cde47d8d55)\n\nSource: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. \n\nReleased July 30, 2024\n"

He will continue to serve on the AMD executive team in an advisory role and support the transition until his retirement date.\n\n“Victor re-joined AMD in 2022 following the acquisition of Xilinx and played an important role successfully integrating and scaling our embedded business and leading our cross-company AI strategy,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “Under his leadership, AMD became the industry’s #1 provider of FPGA and adaptive computing solutions. On behalf of the AMD Board, executive leadership team and the thousands of employees who have worked with him, I want to thank Victor for his outstanding leadership and wish him the best in his retirement.”\n\nPeng retires with over 40 years of experience defining and delivering leadership technologies across FPGAs, SoCs, GPUs and high-performance CPUs. He has served as president at AMD since February 2022 when he rejoined the company after the acquisition of Xilinx, where he spent 14 years, most recently serving as president, CEO and member of the board of directors.\n\nAs part of the transition, Senior Vice President of the Artificial Intelligence Group (AIG) Vamsi Boppana will expand his current responsibilities to include the AMD Instinct™ data center AI accelerator business. Boppana joined Xilinx in 2008 and has served in a variety of technical and business leadership positions. He is currently responsible for cross-company AI software and ecosystem development and AI hardware roadmaps. Senior Vice President and General Manager, Adaptive and Embedded Computing Group Salil Raje will continue in his role leading the AMD embedded business.

These forward-looking outlook statements and non-GAAP measures are based on current expectations as of October 29, 2024, and assumptions and beliefs that\ninvolve numerous risks and uncertainties. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be\nrequired by law. All items, except revenue, are on a non-GAAP basis. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP financial outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets,\nincome tax provision, and other non-recurring items such as impairment charges and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically\nuncertain or outside of AMD's control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time.\n2. 2.
