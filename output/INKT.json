(NASDAQ: INKT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of allogeneic, off-the-shelf, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases, today announced results for the third quarter 2024. MiNK will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\n“Our progress this quarter reflects MiNK’s commitment to advancing effective and scalable therapies in cancer and immune-mediated diseases,” said Jennifer Buell, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of MiNK Therapeutics. “We have continued to expand our iNKT cell therapy platform and partnerships to address high-need areas, recently showcasing the versatility of iNKT cells in two presentations at SITC. Our clinical programs are advancing with the ongoing Phase 2 study in second-line and later-stage gastric cancer, with initial data anticipated early next year. These developments underscore our momentum in delivering impactful treatments for patients.”\n\n**Recent Business Updates:**\n\n  * **Board Appointment:** Dr. Robert Kadlec, a recognized authority in biodefense, pandemic preparedness, and public health strategy, has joined MiNK’s Board of Directors. Dr. Kadlec’s expertise in public health and biodefense will support MiNK’s iNKT cell platform in addressing critical infectious diseases.\n  * **Research Collaboration:** MiNK and Autonomous Therapeutics, a pioneer in disease-activated RNA medicines, entered into a research collaboration to target and treat metastatic tumors. The collaboration combines Autonomous’ encrypted RNA™ (encRNA) technology with MiNK’s iNKT cell therapies, MiNK-215 and agenT-797, with the goal of developing therapies to effectively target metastatic cancer cells.\n  * **SITC 2024 Presentations:** Two poster presentations at the Society for Cancer Immunotherapy (SITC) 2024 Annual Meeting highlighted the potential of iNKT cell therapies in advancing cancer treatment: \n    * AgenT-797 demonstrated enhanced activity of checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific engagers in combination.\n    * PRAME-targeted TCR iNKT cell therapy showcased the potential to address limitations of traditional T cell therapies in targeting solid tumors such as NSCLC, ovarian cancer, melanoma, and sarcoma. Preclinical studies indicate that PRAME-TCR-iNKTs can specifically target and kill tumor cells.\n  * **Solid Tumor Clinical Program:** AgenT-797 is advancing in an enrolling Phase 2 trial in second-line and later-stage advanced gastroesophageal cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, with results expected at a major conference in early 2025.\n  * **Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) Program:** MiNK is advancing initiation of Phase 1 trial with external financial support to investigate agenT-797 for the treatment of GvHD, in collaboration with leading research institutions in the U.S. and EU for dosing to start in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nMiNK ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.3 million reflecting cash used in operations for the three and nine months ended September 2024 of $3 million and $7.8 million, respectively, reduced from $7.8 million and $12.7 million, for the same period in 2023.\n\nNet loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $1.8 million, or $0.05 per share, and $8.3 million, or $0.22 per share, respectively. This compares to $5.1 million, or $0.15 per share, and $17 million or $0.50 per share, for the same periods in 2023.\n\n**Summary Consolidated Financial Information**  \n---  \n**Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet Data**  \n(in thousands)  \n(unaudited)  \nSeptember 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023  \nCash and cash equivalents | $ | 6,328 | $ | 3,367  \nTotal assets | 7,375 | 4,552  \n**Other Financial Information**  \n(in thousands)  \n(unaudited)  \nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nCash used in operations | $ | 2,995 | $ | 4,209 | $ | 7,828 | $ | 12,727  \n**Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations Data**  \n(in thousands, except per share data)  \n(unaudited)  \nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30,  \n2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023  \nOperating expenses:  \nResearch and development | $ | 541 | $ | 3,427 | $ | 4,930 | $ | 12,179  \nGeneral and administrative | 1,163 | 1,796 | 3,505 | 5,242  \nChange in fair value of related party note | 181 | - | 350 | -  \nOperating loss | 1,885 | 5,223 | 8,785 | 17,421  \nOther income, net | (78 | ) | (107 | ) | (464 | ) | (422 | )  \nNet loss | $ | 1,807 | $ | 5,116 | $ | 8,321 | $ | 16,999  \nPer common share data, basic and diluted:  \nNet loss | $ | (0.05 | ) | $ | (0.15 | ) | $ | (0.22 | ) | $ | (0.50 | )  \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted | 39,534 | 34,498 | 37,115 | 34,293  \n  \n**Conference Call**\n\nDial-in numbers: 646-307-1963 (New York), 800-715-9871 (USA & Canada)\n\nConference ID: 5606166\n\n**Webcast**\n\nA live webcast and replay of the conference call will be accessible from the Events & Presentations page of the Company’s website at [https://investor.minktherapeutics.com/events-and-presentations](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Qaf0LuJ95hGEr47FN9c-Fdee5vPq_8LB6J1q42LIU3Ainf4JBCkadXyv81JbVL14NZs1GcErWa5Kqn3al867qe_fsoAjRGBcjQOKbd6efy54YhbtQ5argksMkRPOtc7_rylCo8oXF9Hypt7xdj-vgnnqwyqLDa1gIIthwex4heel_gbEM0QFyuikLG1FaQY4ZkqYuL6mWO_t6FB5eKwFdg==) and via [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ukmiq8bo/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Qaf0LuJ95hGEr47FN9c-FZjwmadApGI3lAeCe1U8cb0Xv61jlPMdFz4Z9FaWxZRI-_MVA2r1Qwt-Xaqn7732bukAtD1vAOw3Asy-YTlyMI7P4GLO25JunGYXqFUCjQZTRUqED3vh-H8qiCrR5oQ-KBJjRvuzrb_NUJC45SglyPI=).\n\n**About MiNK Therapeutics**\n\nMiNK Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of allogeneic invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases.

(NASDAQ: INKT), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of allogeneic, off-the-shelf, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases, today announced data from two poster presentations at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 39th Annual Meeting in Houston, Texas. The presentations showcased new data from MiNK’s iNKT cell therapy programs, agenT-797 and PRAME-TCR.\n\n“The data we presented at SITC reflect the potential of iNKT cell therapies to offer meaningful advancements in cancer treatment. AgenT-797 shows important immune modulating effects, enhancing the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors and bispecific engagers,” said Dr. Marc Van Dijk, CSO at MiNK. “Additionally, our PRAME-TCR iNKT represents a novel and differentiated approach to treat PRAME positive solid tumors. By leveraging iNKT cells’ ability to target the tumor microenvironment without lymphodepletion or HLA-matching, we aim to provide durable, scalable, and accessible solutions for patients with limited treatment options.”\n\n**AgenT-797 Combination Boosts Activity of Checkpoint Inhibitors and Bispecific Engagers in Challenging Solid Tumors**\n\n  * **AgenT-797 alone or in combination with anti-PD-1** (nivo or pembro) shows durable disease control in majority of heavily pretreated patients.\n  * **AgenT-797 combined with bispecific engagers** targeting antigens such as MUC16, HER2, Claudin 18.2, and DLL3, promote increased T-cell activation, efficient tumor cell killing, and reduced exhaustion and myeloid cell activity.\n  * **Ongoing Clinical Studies:** AgenT-797 is advancing in an enrolling Phase 2 trial with an innovative five-treatment combination regimen that includes botensilimab, balstilimab, and standard-of-care chemotherapy. This trial targets 2L+ advanced gastroesophageal cancer patients and is being conducted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, with results expected in 2025.\n\n\n\n**PRAME-TCR iNKT Represents a Promising Targeted Therapy for Refractory Solid Tumors**\n\n  * **iNKT cells present an ideal platform for tumor-targeting T cell receptor (TCR)** expression due to the absence of conventional αβ TCRs and endogenous class I MHC molecules.\n  * **MiNK’s allogeneic PRAME-targeted TCR addresses the limitations of traditional T cell therapies.** As an allogeneic, gene-editing-free solution, it expresses an engineered αβ PRAME-TCR with no risk of heterodimerization, offering a potentially safer and more precise approach.\n  * In preclinical studies, **PRAME-TCR-iNKTs direct tumor cell killing with high specificity** , which highlights the versatility of iNKT cells and their potential of to treat solid tumors such as NSCLC, ovarian, melanoma and sarcoma.\n\n\n\n**Presentation Details**\n\nTitle: AgenT-797 iNKT cell therapy can be combined with next-generation immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and bi-specific engagers to improve the anti-tumor response\n\nAbstract Number: 753\n\nDate: Friday, November 8th\n\nTitle: PRAME-TCR iNKT cell therapy: Opportunity for best-in-class off-the-shelf solid tumor therapy targeting PRAME\n\nAbstract Number: 374\n\nSession Date: Saturday, November 9th\n\n**About MiNK Therapeutics**\n\nMiNK Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the discovery, development, and commercialization of allogeneic invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell therapies to treat cancer and other immune-mediated diseases.
