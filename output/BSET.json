(Nasdaq: BSET) announced today certain work force reductions designed to both streamline operations and better match the Company’s cost structure to the current rate of business. Through a combination of layoffs and retirements throughout the organization, this workforce reduction will result in approximately $2.5 million in annual savings. Including this action, Bassett has reduced its headcount by 11% over the past year. The Company expects to record an associated $500,000 severance charge in the current quarter.\n\nThe Company further announced that it continues executing on its five-point restructuring plan announced on July 10, 2024 which is projected to provide between $5.5 million and $6.5 million of annual cost savings. Specifically, those points include:\n\n  * Drive organic growth through Bassett-branded retail locations, omni-channel capabilities, and enhanced customization positioning to expand dedicated distribution footprint.\n  * Rationalize US wood manufacturing from two locations into one primary location, supported by a small satellite operation.\n  * Optimize inventory and drop unproductive lines.\n  * Improve overall cost structure and invest capital in refurbishment of current retail locations.\n  * Close the Noa Home e-commerce business.\n\n\n\nCoupled with the work force reductions discussed above, annual savings are now projected to be between $8.0 million and $9.0 million.\n\n“The cutback announced today reinforces our commitment to press on with the restructuring plan we announced back in July,” commented Rob Spilman, Chairman and CEO. “These decisions were quite difficult as several long-time associates were involved. While we have not seen a measurable uptick in orders, the actions that we have already taken have begun to yield better results. We were pleased with the reception that our new products received at the Fall High Point Furniture Market and look forward to those items hitting retail floors in early 2025. Nevertheless, we remain focused on the cost reductions that have been previously communicated.”\n\n“Specifically, we have completed the consolidation of our Virginia based wood production facilities and have seen better performance from the remaining concern the past two months,” continued Spilman. “Noa Home, our Canada-based e-commerce furniture foray has officially shut down and we are liquidating remaining inventory. We received several new commitments for our Bassett Design Studio concept at the Market and our e-commerce sales have consistently grown the past five months. We head into fiscal 2025 with our strong balance sheet intact and resolved to improve our financial results no matter what the overall economy presents.”\n\nAbout Bassett Furniture Industries, Inc.

With 87 company- and licensee-owned stores at the time of this release, Bassett has leveraged its strong brand name in furniture into a network of corporate and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories.

(Nasdaq: BSET) reported today its results of operations for its third quarter ended August 31, 2024. In addition, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share of common stock, payable on Nov. 29, 2024, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Nov. 15, 2024. This dividend represents an 11% increase over the prior year’s quarterly dividend. \n\n _Q3 Consolidated Business Highlights: [FY 24 vs. FY 23, unless otherwise specified]_\n\n  * Revenues decreased 13%, impacted by a cyber incident that suspended all financial systems and manufacturing for 7 days.\n  * Operating loss of $6.4 million, which included a $1.2 million loss on a logistical services contract the Company abandoned and various costs associated with the cyber incident.\n  * Gross margin of 53.0%, which included $0.6 million of manufacturing wages paid during the cyber shutdown. Excluding the wage charge, gross profit margin would have been 53.8% as compared to adjusted gross margin of 52.7% in 2023 (see Table 5).\n  * Diluted loss per share of $0.52 vs. a loss of $0.30 in 2023.\n  * Limited cash flow deficit for the quarter to $0.4 million despite challenging results and cyber disruption related costs.\n\n\n\n_Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Overview_  _(Dollars in millions)_\n\n**Sales**| **Operating Income (Loss)**  \n---|---  \n**3rd Qtr**| **Dollar**| **%**| **3rd Qtr**| **% of**| **3rd Qtr**| **% of**  \n**2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change**| **2024** | **Sales**| **2023** | **Sales**  \nConsolidated (1)| $| 75.6| $| 87.2| $| (11.6| )| -13.3| %| $| (6.4| )| -8.5%| $| (3.8| )| -4.4%  \nWholesale| $| 47.8| $| 56.7| $| (8.9| )| -15.7| %| $| 4.4| 9.2%| $| 6.3| 11.1%  \nRetail| $| 47.3| $| 52.3| $| (5.0| )| -9.6| %| $| (2.8| )| -5.9%| $| (3.0| )| -5.7%  \nCorporate & Other (2)| $| 1.0| $| 1.8| $| (0.8| )| -44.4| %| $| (7.0| )| N/A| $| (7.4| )| N/A  \n(1) Our consolidated results for the quarter include certain intercompany eliminations as well as a $1.2 million contract abandonment charge which are not allocated to our segment operating results. See Table 4, \"Segment Information\" below for an illustration of the effects of these items on our consolidated sales and operating income.  \n(2) Corporate and Other includes the operations of Noa Home Inc. along with the shared Corporate costs that are benefiting both the Wholesale and Retail segments.  \n  \n“The third quarter is historically our slowest as we customarily shut down manufacturing for the week of July 4th,” said Robert H. Spilman, Jr., Bassett Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Although we had additional challenges this year, we delivered strong gross margins. In mid-July, we reported that we detected unauthorized activities in our IT systems, which resulted in us shutting down our IT systems and ceasing manufacturing for 7 days. The industry remained challenged by economic factors in the quarter, including a slow housing market that is forecasted to improve heading into 2025. With our strong balance sheet and our focus on right-sizing our expense structure, our goal is to drive better profitability.”\n\nUpdate on Restructuring Plan The Company made progress on the restructuring plan announced in July to lower its cost structure and to strengthen operations for topline growth. The comprehensive strategy builds on the strength of Bassett’s brand quality, design expertise and service, and focuses on driving revenue growth and profitability long-term. The five-point plan will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter. “We are running a leaner operation, reducing expenses and investing in new products and services,” Spilman added. “Through our restructuring plan, we are on target to improve our bottom-line between $5.5 million and $6.5 million on an annual basis. We are committed to returning to profitability.”\n\nConference Call and Webcast The Company will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly results on October 10, 2024, at 9:00 am ET. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast, accessible through the Company’s investor relations website, <https://investors.bassettfurniture.com/>.

(Nasdaq: BSET) reported today its results of operations for its second quarter ended June 1, 2024. The Company also announced a restructuring plan designed to improve long-term operational and financial performance.\n\n_Q2 Consolidated Business Highlights_ _: [FY 24 vs. FY 23, unless otherwise specified]_\n\n  * Revenues decreased 17%.\n  * When comparing to the first quarter of 2024, revenues increased 3.8%, normalizing the first quarter for the extra week due to our fiscal calendar.\n  * Operating loss of $8.5 million which included asset impairment charges of $5.5 million and additional inventory valuation charges of $2.7 million.\n  * Gross margin of 52.5%, which included the increased inventory valuation charges noted above. Excluding the inventory valuation charges, gross profit margin would have been 55.7% (see Table 5).\n  * Loss per share of $0.82 vs. diluted earnings per share $0.24.\n  * Generated $5.8 million of operating cash flow for the quarter.\n\n\n\n_Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Overview_ _(Dollars in millions)_\n\n**Sales** | **Operating Income (Loss)**  \n---|---  \n**2nd Qtr** | **Dollar** | **%** | **2nd Qtr** | **% of** | **2nd Qtr** | **% of**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **Change** | **Change** | **2024** | **Sales** | **2023** | **Sales**  \nConsolidated (1) | $ | 83.4 | $ | 100.5 | $ | (17.1 | ) | -17.0 | % | $ | (8.5 | ) | -10.2 | % | $ | 2.5 | 2.5 | %  \nWholesale | $ | 52.6 | $ | 61.8 | $ | (9.2 | ) | -14.9 | % | $ | 5.7 | 10.8 | % | $ | 7.0 | 11.3 | %  \nRetail | $ | 50.5 | $ | 60.8 | $ | (10.3 | ) | -16.9 | % | $ | (2.2 | ) | -4.4 | % | $ | 0.8 | 1.3 | %  \nCorporate & Other (2) | $ | 1.1 | $ | 2.3 | $ | (1.2 | ) | -52.2 | % | $ | (6.9 | ) | N/A | $ | (6.9 | ) | N/A  \n  \n(1) | Our consolidated results include certain intercompany eliminations as well as asset impairment charges of $5.5 million which are not allocated to our segment operating results. See Table 4, “Segment Information” below for an illustration of the effects of these items on our consolidated sales and operating income.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Corporate and Other includes the operations of Noa Home Inc. along with the shared Corporate costs that are benefiting both the Wholesale and Retail segments.  \n  \n“Excluding the additional inventory valuation charges that we recorded, we were pleased with another quarter of strong gross margins, despite lower sales,” said Robert H. Spilman, Jr., Bassett Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The environment for housing remains challenging and consumers are choosing to invest in experiences over their homes, a change from the Covid period. We continue to be disciplined on expenses to improve operating efficiency.”\n\nRestructuring Plan The Company also announced a restructuring plan to more right-size its cost structure and to prepare it for topline growth. The comprehensive strategy builds on the strength of Bassett’s brand quality, design expertise and service, and focuses on driving revenue growth and profitability long-term. The five-point plan includes:\n\n  * Drive organic growth through Bassett-branded retail locations, omni-channel capabilities, and enhanced customization positioning to expand dedicated distribution footprint.\n  * Rationalize US wood manufacturing from two locations into one primary location, supported by a small satellite operation.\n  * Optimize inventory and drop unproductive lines.\n  * Improve overall cost structure and invest capital in refurbishment of current retail locations.\n  * Close the Noa Home e-commerce business.\n\n\n\n“Bassett Furniture has a long history of weathering economic cycles, such as the inflationary environment and slow housing market we’re experiencing in 2024 – factors that led to soft demand in our second quarter,” explained Spilman. “The business climate has remained difficult through the first six months of this year and may not improve in the near future. Accordingly, we are committed to returning to profitability by running a leaner operation, with priority focus on both our inventory position and the overall cost structure. We believe that our restructuring plan, expected to improve our bottom line between $5.5 million and $6.5 million on an annual basis, coupled with our solid balance sheet, puts us in a position to be a considerably stronger company when customer demand inevitably improves. I’m particularly pleased that our Board believes in our ability to improve operations and continue our strong cash generation by increasing our quarterly dividend by 11%.”\n\nConference Call and Webcast The Company will hold a conference call to discuss its quarterly results on July 11, 2024, at 9:00 am ET. The public is invited to listen to the conference call by webcast, accessible through the Company’s investor relations website, <https://investors.bassettfurniture.com/>. Participants can also listen to the conference call via <https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/332ii2e5>.
