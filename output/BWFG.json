(NASDAQ: BWFG), a leading commercial bank with a growing digital focus, reported GAAP net income of $1.9 million, or $0.24 per share for the third quarter of 2024, versus $1.1 million, or $0.14 per share, for the second quarter of 2024. The Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.20 per share cash dividend, payable November 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 11, 2024. \n\nThird quarter of 2024 results include an $8.2 million previously disclosed charge-off taken against a $13.7 million office loan participation as a $0.79 drag to earnings per share. Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) of $9.0 million, or $1.17 per share, fell 7% relative to the second quarter of 2024 at $9.7 million, or $1.25 per share. \n\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company announced that on October 23, 2024, its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the share repurchase plan, the Company is authorized to buy back up to 250,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. In connection with the authorization of the new plan, the Company terminated its existing plan, originally approved in 2018 and amended in 2021, pursuant to which the Company has purchased 532,802 shares of its common stock. \n\n**Discussion of Outlook; Bankwell Financial Group President and CEO, Christopher R. Gruseke:**\n\n\"Although we were disappointed with the elevated charge-off in the third quarter, the Company’s go-forward outlook remains favorable. Our liability sensitive balance sheet leaves us well positioned for accelerating margin expansion in the coming quarters, and we believe that strategic investments in our commercial lending platform will help us diversify our assets and improve our profitability.\" \n\n**Key Points for Third** **Quarter and Bankwell’s Outlook**\n\n**Brokered Deposits Decrease, Liability Sensitive Balance Sheet.**\n\n  * Brokered deposits declined $24.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and are down $168.5 million since December 31, 2023. \n  * Reported net interest margin was 2.72%, which included a -6 basis point impact as a result of charges associated with a single non-performing loan and fees associated with called brokered CDs. \n  * With $1.3 billion of time deposits maturing in the next 12 months at a weighted average rate of 4.89%, the Company anticipates an annualized reduction in funding costs by $3.35 million, given current pricing. This translates into approximately $0.33 incremental EPS, or approximately 11 basis points on net interest margin, given no further changes to Fed Funds and stable asset yields. \n  * Further, the Company anticipates $0.5 billion of loans to reprice or mature over the same period, which could further benefit net interest margin by an additional 15 to 20 basis points on an annualized basis. \n\n\n\n**NPL to be Sold, Residential Care Upgrades a Positive Sign.**\n\n  * A $27.1 million multifamily commercial real estate loan was placed on nonperforming status as of September 30, 2024. As of October 28, 2024, the Company has a signed agreement for the sale of this loan at par value. As of September 30, 2024, this loan comprises 103 basis points of the 2.50% nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans. \n  * Elsewhere, favorable macroeconomic trends were reflected in improved operating results among the Company's residential care borrowers. Specifically, during the quarter four relationships totaling $42 million were upgraded. The Company anticipates the positive trend to continue as both Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational costs normalize. \n\n\n\n**Ongoing Investments with Continued Focus on Efficiency** . \n\n  * The Company continues to invest for future growth, with notable recent developments including a lending partnership with Lendio, the launch of Bankwell Direct, the launch of a new Small Business Administration (SBA) division, and hiring key leadership personnel. \n  * The Company continues to operate efficiently with a non-interest expense to average asset ratio of 1.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n\n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nReturn on average assets (1) |  0.24  |  %  |  0.14  |  %  |  0.47  |  %  |  1.03  |  %  |  1.19  |  %   \nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue return on average assets (1) |  1.13  |  %  |  1.22  |  %  |  1.10  |  %  |  1.27  |  %  |  1.37  |  %   \nReturn on average shareholders' equity (1) |  2.83  |  %  |  1.65  |  %  |  5.59  |  %  |  12.82  |  %  |  15.19  |  %   \nNet interest margin (1) |  2.72  |  %  |  2.75  |  %  |  2.71  |  %  |  2.81  |  %  |  2.85  |  %   \nEfficiency Ratio (1)(2) |  58.8  |  %  |  55.9  |  %  |  60.3  |  %  |  55.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %   \nNoninterest expense to average assets (1) |  1.62  |  %  |  1.55  |  %  |  1.66  |  %  |  1.56  |  %  |  1.48  |  %   \nNet loan charge-offs as % of average loans (1) |  0.56  |  %  |  0.01  |  %  |  0.11  |  %  |  0.01  |  %  |  —  |  %   \nDividend payout (1)(3) |  82.30  |  %  |  142.86  |  %  |  41.67  |  %  |  18.35  |  %  |  16.00  |  %   \nFully diluted tangible book value per common share (1) |  $  |  33.76  |  $  |  33.61  |  $  |  33.57  |  $  |  33.39  |  $  |  32.55   \nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets (1)(4) |  12.83  |  %  |  12.98  |  %  |  12.63  |  %  |  12.32  |  %  |  11.86  |  %   \nTotal common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (1)(4) |  11.80  |  %  |  11.73  |  %  |  11.60  |  %  |  11.30  |  %  |  10.82  |  %   \nTier I Capital to Average Assets (1)(4) |  10.24  |  %  |  10.17  |  %  |  10.09  |  %  |  9.81  |  %  |  9.60  |  %   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets (1) |  8.40  |  %  |  8.42  |  %  |  8.42  |  %  |  8.19  |  %  |  7.86  |  %   \nEarnings per common share - diluted  |  $  |  0.24  |  $  |  0.14  |  $  |  0.48  |  $  |  1.09  |  $  |  1.25   \nCommon shares issued and outstanding  |  7,858,573  |  7,866,499  |  7,908,180  |  7,882,616  |  7,841,616   \n(1)  |  Non-GAAP Financial Measure, refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\" sections of this document for additional detail.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Efficiency ratio is defined as noninterest expense, less other real estate owned expenses and amortization of intangible assets, divided by our operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income excluding gains and losses on sales of securities and gains and losses on other real estate owned.

The decrease in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to an increase in interest expense on deposits. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $65.8 million, versus $75.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to an increase in interest expense on deposits and lower gains from loan sales, partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans due to higher loan yields and prepayment fees. \n  * The net interest margin (fully taxable equivalent basis) for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 2.72% and 2.85%, respectively. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to an increase in funding costs, partially offset by an increase in interest income on earning assets. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the net interest margin includes a -5 basis point unfavorable impact as a result of the $27.1 million commercial real estate loan being placed on non-performing status plus a -1 basis point unfavorable impact from one-time costs associated with Brokered CDs called during the quarter. \n  * Overall non-interest income of $1.2 million increased 69.3% when compared to the second quarter, primarily due to higher gains as a result of more SBA loan sales. Service charges increased when compared to the second quarter and continues to grow on a positive trend line. \n  * Total non-interest expense of $12.9 million increased 5% compared to the second quarter as the Company continues to invest in strategic initiatives. \n\n\n\n**Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans (\"ACL-Loans\")**\n\nThe ACL-Loans was $27.8 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $27.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The ACL-Loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.06% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.03% as of December 31, 2023. \n\nProvision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the quarter was primarily due to a charge-off of $8.2 million which previously did not have an associated specific reserve. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million recovery on a previously charged-off loan. \n\nTotal nonaccrual loans increased $9.3 million to $65.5 million as of September 30, 2024 when compared to the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $27.1 million commercial real estate multifamily loan 1 . The increase was partially offset by two loans that were partially charged-off for a total of $15.4 million and two loans that were paid off totaling $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to 2.07% at September 30, 2024 from 1.53% at December 31, 2023. \n\n  1. As of October 28, 2024, the Company has a signed agreement for the sale of this loan at par value. \n\n**BANKWELL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.** **ASSET QUALITY (unaudited)** **(Dollars in thousands)**  \n---  \n**For the Quarter Ended**  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**ACL-Loans:**  \nBalance at beginning of period  |  $  |  36,083  |  $  |  27,991  |  $  |  27,946  |  $  |  29,284  |  $  |  30,694   \nCharge-offs:   \nResidential real estate  |  —  |  (9  |  )  |  (132  |  )  |  —  |  —   \nCommercial real estate  |  (8,184  |  )  |  (522  |  )  |  (3,306  |  )  |  (824  |  )  |  —   \nCommercial business  |  (7,010  |  )  |  —  |  (197  |  )  |  —  |  —   \nConsumer  |  (17  |  )  |  (12  |  )  |  (49  |  )  |  (15  |  )  |  (31  |  )   \nConstruction  |  (616  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nTotal charge-offs  |  (15,827  |  )  |  (543  |  )  |  (3,684  |  )  |  (839  |  )  |  (31  |  )   \nRecoveries:   \nResidential real estate  |  —  |  141  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nCommercial real estate  |  1,013  |  113  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nCommercial business  |  (34  |  )  |  —  |  27  |  464  |  35   \nConsumer  |  1  |  13  |  4  |  3  |  19   \nConstruction  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nTotal recoveries  |  980  |  267  |  31  |  467  |  54   \nNet loan (charge-offs) recoveries  |  (14,847  |  )  |  (276  |  )  |  (3,653  |  )  |  (372  |  )  |  23   \nProvision (credit) for credit losses - loans  |  6,516  |  8,368  |  3,698  |  (966  |  )  |  (1,433  |  )   \n**Balance at end of period** |  $  |  27,752  |  $  |  36,083  |  $  |  27,991  |  $  |  27,946  |  $  |  29,284   \n**As of**  \n---  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30, 2023**  \n**Asset quality:**  \nNonaccrual loans   \nResidential real estate  |  $  |  1,316  |  $  |  1,339  |  $  |  1,237  |  $  |  1,386  |  $  |  1,408   \nCommercial real estate  |  46,360  |  28,088  |  19,083  |  23,009  |  1,898   \nCommercial business  |  9,101  |  17,396  |  16,841  |  15,430  |  7,352   \nConstruction  |  8,766  |  9,382  |  9,382  |  9,382  |  9,382   \nConsumer  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  7,917   \nTotal nonaccrual loans  |  65,543  |  56,205  |  46,543  |  49,207  |  27,957   \nOther real estate owned  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nTotal nonperforming assets  |  $  |  65,543  |  $  |  56,205  |  $  |  46,543  |  $  |  49,207  |  $  |  27,957   \nNonperforming loans as a % of total loans  |  2.50  |  %  |  2.12  |  %  |  1.74  |  %  |  1.81  |  %  |  1.01  |  %   \nNonperforming assets as a % of total assets  |  2.07  |  %  |  1.79  |  %  |  1.48  |  %  |  1.53  |  %  |  0.86  |  %   \nACL-loans as a % of total loans  |  1.06  |  %  |  1.36  |  %  |  1.04  |  %  |  1.03  |  %  |  1.06  |  %   \nACL-loans as a % of nonperforming loans  |  42.34  |  %  |  64.20  |  %  |  60.14  |  %  |  56.79  |  %  |  104.75  |  %   \nTotal past due loans to total loans  |  2.48  |  %  |  0.84  |  %  |  1.44  |  %  |  0.78  |  %  |  1.44  |  %   \n  \n**Financial Condition & Capital**\n\nAssets totaled $3.2 billion at September 30, 2024, a decrease of $54.4 million, or 1.7% compared to December 31, 2023.

Forward-looking statements include statements regarding anticipated future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and “intend” or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may.” Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include increased competitive pressures, changes in the interest rate environment, general economic conditions or conditions within the banking industry or securities markets, and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged._\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ **\n\n_In addition to evaluating the Company's financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), management may evaluate certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio. A computation and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used for these purposes is contained in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures tables. We believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. For example, the Company believes that the efficiency ratio is useful in the assessment of financial performance, including noninterest expense control. The Company believes that tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common shareholders' equity, fully diluted tangible book value per common share, adjusted noninterest expense, operating revenue, efficiency ratio, average tangible common equity, annualized return on average tangible common equity, return on average assets, return on average shareholders' equity, pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue,_ _net interest margin, net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans,_ _pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue on average assets, and the dividend payout ratio are useful to evaluate the relative strength of the Company's performance and capital position. We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure._\n\n**BANKWELL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.** **CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (unaudited)** **(Dollars in thousands)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCash and due from banks  |  $  |  275,829  |  $  |  234,277  |  $  |  245,043  |  $  |  267,521  |  $  |  256,973   \nFederal funds sold  |  15,508  |  17,103  |  2,584  |  1,636  |  1,122   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  291,337  |  251,380  |  247,627  |  269,157  |  258,095   \nInvestment securities   \nMarketable equity securities, at fair value  |  2,148  |  2,079  |  2,069  |  2,070  |  1,975   \nAvailable for sale investment securities, at fair value  |  108,866  |  107,635  |  108,417  |  109,736  |  97,907   \nHeld to maturity investment securities, at amortized cost  |  34,886  |  28,286  |  15,739  |  15,817  |  15,885   \nTotal investment securities  |  145,900  |  138,000  |  126,225  |  127,623  |  115,767   \nLoans receivable (net of ACL-Loans of $27,752, $36,083, $27,991, $27,946, and $29,284 at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively)  |  2,591,551  |  2,616,691  |  2,646,686  |  2,685,301  |  2,735,242   \nAccrued interest receivable  |  14,714  |  14,675  |  15,104  |  14,863  |  15,648   \nFederal Home Loan Bank stock, at cost  |  5,655  |  5,655  |  5,655  |  5,696  |  5,696   \nPremises and equipment, net  |  24,780  |  25,599  |  26,161  |  27,018  |  26,899   \nBank-owned life insurance  |  52,443  |  52,097  |  51,764  |  51,435  |  51,119   \nGoodwill  |  2,589  |  2,589  |  2,589  |  2,589  |  2,589   \nDeferred income taxes, net  |  9,300  |  11,345  |  9,137  |  9,383  |  9,395   \nOther assets  |  22,811  |  23,623  |  24,326  |  22,417  |  29,326   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  3,161,080  |  $  |  3,141,654  |  $  |  3,155,274  |  $  |  3,215,482  |  $  |  3,249,776   \n**LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nLiabilities   \nDeposits   \nNoninterest bearing deposits  |  $  |  293,195  |  $  |  328,475  |  $  |  376,248  |  $  |  346,172  |  $  |  345,433   \nInterest bearing deposits  |  2,394,976  |  2,333,900  |  2,297,274  |  2,390,585  |  2,423,193   \nTotal deposits  |  2,688,171  |  2,662,375  |  2,673,522  |  2,736,757  |  2,768,626   \nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank  |  90,000  |  90,000  |  90,000  |  90,000  |  90,000   \nSubordinated debentures  |  69,389  |  69,328  |  69,266  |  69,205  |  69,143   \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities  |  45,594  |  52,975  |  54,454  |  53,768  |  64,145   \n**Total liabilities** |  2,893,154  |  2,874,678  |  2,887,242  |  2,949,730  |  2,991,914   \nShareholders’ equity   \nCommon stock, no par value  |  118,429  |  118,037  |  118,401  |  118,247  |  117,181   \nRetained earnings  |  151,257  |  150,895  |  151,350  |  149,169  |  142,205   \nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss)  |  (1,760  |  )  |  (1,956  |  )  |  (1,719  |  )  |  (1,664  |  )  |  (1,524  |  )   \n**Total shareholders’ equity** |  267,926  |  266,976  |  268,032  |  265,752  |  257,862   \n**Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity** |  $  |  3,161,080  |  $  |  3,141,654  |  $  |  3,155,274  |  $  |  3,215,482  |  $  |  3,249,776   \n**BANKWELL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

(NASDAQ: BWFG), a leading commercial bank with a growing digital focus, reported GAAP net income of $1.9 million, or $0.24 per share for the third quarter of 2024, versus $1.1 million, or $0.14 per share, for the second quarter of 2024. The Company's Board of Directors declared a $0.20 per share cash dividend, payable November 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on November 11, 2024. \n\nThird quarter of 2024 results include an $8.2 million previously disclosed charge-off taken against a $13.7 million office loan participation as a $0.79 drag to earnings per share. Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue (PPNR) of $9.0 million, or $1.17 per share, fell 7% relative to the second quarter of 2024 at $9.7 million, or $1.25 per share. \n\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company announced that on October 23, 2024, its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the share repurchase plan, the Company is authorized to buy back up to 250,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. In connection with the authorization of the new plan, the Company terminated its existing plan, originally approved in 2018 and amended in 2021, pursuant to which the Company has purchased 532,802 shares of its common stock. \n\n**Discussion of Outlook; Bankwell Financial Group President and CEO, Christopher R. Gruseke:**\n\n\"Although we were disappointed with the elevated charge-off in the third quarter, the Company’s go-forward outlook remains favorable. Our liability sensitive balance sheet leaves us well positioned for accelerating margin expansion in the coming quarters, and we believe that strategic investments in our commercial lending platform will help us diversify our assets and improve our profitability.\" \n\n**Key Points for Third** **Quarter and Bankwell’s Outlook**\n\n**Brokered Deposits Decrease, Liability Sensitive Balance Sheet.**\n\n  * Brokered deposits declined $24.2 million in the third quarter of 2024 and are down $168.5 million since December 31, 2023. \n  * Reported net interest margin was 2.72%, which included a -6 basis point impact as a result of charges associated with a single non-performing loan and fees associated with called brokered CDs. \n  * With $1.3 billion of time deposits maturing in the next 12 months at a weighted average rate of 4.89%, the Company anticipates an annualized reduction in funding costs by $3.35 million, given current pricing. This translates into approximately $0.33 incremental EPS, or approximately 11 basis points on net interest margin, given no further changes to Fed Funds and stable asset yields. \n  * Further, the Company anticipates $0.5 billion of loans to reprice or mature over the same period, which could further benefit net interest margin by an additional 15 to 20 basis points on an annualized basis. \n\n\n\n**NPL to be Sold, Residential Care Upgrades a Positive Sign.**\n\n  * A $27.1 million multifamily commercial real estate loan was placed on nonperforming status as of September 30, 2024. As of October 28, 2024, the Company has a signed agreement for the sale of this loan at par value. As of September 30, 2024, this loan comprises 103 basis points of the 2.50% nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans. \n  * Elsewhere, favorable macroeconomic trends were reflected in improved operating results among the Company's residential care borrowers. Specifically, during the quarter four relationships totaling $42 million were upgraded. The Company anticipates the positive trend to continue as both Medicaid reimbursement rates and operational costs normalize. \n\n\n\n**Ongoing Investments with Continued Focus on Efficiency** . \n\n  * The Company continues to invest for future growth, with notable recent developments including a lending partnership with Lendio, the launch of Bankwell Direct, the launch of a new Small Business Administration (SBA) division, and hiring key leadership personnel. \n  * The Company continues to operate efficiently with a non-interest expense to average asset ratio of 1.62% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**\n\n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2023**  \n---|---|---|---|---  \nReturn on average assets (1) |  0.24  |  %  |  0.14  |  %  |  0.47  |  %  |  1.03  |  %  |  1.19  |  %   \nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue return on average assets (1) |  1.13  |  %  |  1.22  |  %  |  1.10  |  %  |  1.27  |  %  |  1.37  |  %   \nReturn on average shareholders' equity (1) |  2.83  |  %  |  1.65  |  %  |  5.59  |  %  |  12.82  |  %  |  15.19  |  %   \nNet interest margin (1) |  2.72  |  %  |  2.75  |  %  |  2.71  |  %  |  2.81  |  %  |  2.85  |  %   \nEfficiency Ratio (1)(2) |  58.8  |  %  |  55.9  |  %  |  60.3  |  %  |  55.0  |  %  |  52.0  |  %   \nNoninterest expense to average assets (1) |  1.62  |  %  |  1.55  |  %  |  1.66  |  %  |  1.56  |  %  |  1.48  |  %   \nNet loan charge-offs as % of average loans (1) |  0.56  |  %  |  0.01  |  %  |  0.11  |  %  |  0.01  |  %  |  —  |  %   \nDividend payout (1)(3) |  82.30  |  %  |  142.86  |  %  |  41.67  |  %  |  18.35  |  %  |  16.00  |  %   \nFully diluted tangible book value per common share (1) |  $  |  33.76  |  $  |  33.61  |  $  |  33.57  |  $  |  33.39  |  $  |  32.55   \nTotal capital to risk-weighted assets (1)(4) |  12.83  |  %  |  12.98  |  %  |  12.63  |  %  |  12.32  |  %  |  11.86  |  %   \nTotal common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (1)(4) |  11.80  |  %  |  11.73  |  %  |  11.60  |  %  |  11.30  |  %  |  10.82  |  %   \nTier I Capital to Average Assets (1)(4) |  10.24  |  %  |  10.17  |  %  |  10.09  |  %  |  9.81  |  %  |  9.60  |  %   \nTangible common equity to tangible assets (1) |  8.40  |  %  |  8.42  |  %  |  8.42  |  %  |  8.19  |  %  |  7.86  |  %   \nEarnings per common share - diluted  |  $  |  0.24  |  $  |  0.14  |  $  |  0.48  |  $  |  1.09  |  $  |  1.25   \nCommon shares issued and outstanding  |  7,858,573  |  7,866,499  |  7,908,180  |  7,882,616  |  7,841,616   \n(1)  |  Non-GAAP Financial Measure, refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\" sections of this document for additional detail.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Efficiency ratio is defined as noninterest expense, less other real estate owned expenses and amortization of intangible assets, divided by our operating revenue, which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income excluding gains and losses on sales of securities and gains and losses on other real estate owned.

The decrease in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to an increase in interest expense on deposits. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $65.8 million, versus $75.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to an increase in interest expense on deposits and lower gains from loan sales, partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans due to higher loan yields and prepayment fees. \n  * The net interest margin (fully taxable equivalent basis) for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 2.72% and 2.85%, respectively. The decrease in the net interest margin was due to an increase in funding costs, partially offset by an increase in interest income on earning assets. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the net interest margin includes a -5 basis point unfavorable impact as a result of the $27.1 million commercial real estate loan being placed on non-performing status plus a -1 basis point unfavorable impact from one-time costs associated with Brokered CDs called during the quarter. \n  * Overall non-interest income of $1.2 million increased 69.3% when compared to the second quarter, primarily due to higher gains as a result of more SBA loan sales. Service charges increased when compared to the second quarter and continues to grow on a positive trend line. \n  * Total non-interest expense of $12.9 million increased 5% compared to the second quarter as the Company continues to invest in strategic initiatives. \n\n\n\n**Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans (\"ACL-Loans\")**\n\nThe ACL-Loans was $27.8 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to $27.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The ACL-Loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.06% as of September 30, 2024 compared to 1.03% as of December 31, 2023. \n\nProvision for credit losses was $6.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the quarter was primarily due to a charge-off of $8.2 million which previously did not have an associated specific reserve. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million recovery on a previously charged-off loan. \n\nTotal nonaccrual loans increased $9.3 million to $65.5 million as of September 30, 2024 when compared to the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to a $27.1 million commercial real estate multifamily loan 1 .

Forward-looking statements include statements regarding anticipated future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” and “intend” or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” or “may.” Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Certain factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results include increased competitive pressures, changes in the interest rate environment, general economic conditions or conditions within the banking industry or securities markets, and legislative and regulatory changes that could adversely affect the business in which the Company and its subsidiaries are engaged._\n\n**_Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ **\n\n_In addition to evaluating the Company's financial performance in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), management may evaluate certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency ratio. A computation and reconciliation of certain non-GAAP financial measures used for these purposes is contained in the accompanying Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures tables. We believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. For example, the Company believes that the efficiency ratio is useful in the assessment of financial performance, including noninterest expense control. The Company believes that tangible common equity, tangible assets, tangible common equity to tangible assets, tangible common shareholders' equity, fully diluted tangible book value per common share, adjusted noninterest expense, operating revenue, efficiency ratio, average tangible common equity, annualized return on average tangible common equity, return on average assets, return on average shareholders' equity, pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue,_ _net interest margin, net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans,_ _pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue on average assets, and the dividend payout ratio are useful to evaluate the relative strength of the Company's performance and capital position. We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure._\n\n**BANKWELL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.** **CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (unaudited)** **(Dollars in thousands)**  \n---  \n**September 30,** **2024** |  **June 30,** **2024** |  **March 31,** **2024** |  **December 31,** **2023** |  **September 30,** **2023**  \n**ASSETS**  \nCash and due from banks  |  $  |  275,829  |  $  |  234,277  |  $  |  245,043  |  $  |  267,521  |  $  |  256,973   \nFederal funds sold  |  15,508  |  17,103  |  2,584  |  1,636  |  1,122   \nCash and cash equivalents  |  291,337  |  251,380  |  247,627  |  269,157  |  258,095   \nInvestment securities   \nMarketable equity securities, at fair value  |  2,148  |  2,079  |  2,069  |  2,070  |  1,975   \nAvailable for sale investment securities, at fair value  |  108,866  |  107,635  |  108,417  |  109,736  |  97,907   \nHeld to maturity investment securities, at amortized cost  |  34,886  |  28,286  |  15,739  |  15,817  |  15,885   \nTotal investment securities  |  145,900  |  138,000  |  126,225  |  127,623  |  115,767   \nLoans receivable (net of ACL-Loans of $27,752, $36,083, $27,991, $27,946, and $29,284 at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, March 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2023, respectively)  |  2,591,551  |  2,616,691  |  2,646,686  |  2,685,301  |  2,735,242   \nAccrued interest receivable  |  14,714  |  14,675  |  15,104  |  14,863  |  15,648   \nFederal Home Loan Bank stock, at cost  |  5,655  |  5,655  |  5,655  |  5,696  |  5,696   \nPremises and equipment, net  |  24,780  |  25,599  |  26,161  |  27,018  |  26,899   \nBank-owned life insurance  |  52,443  |  52,097  |  51,764  |  51,435  |  51,119   \nGoodwill  |  2,589  |  2,589  |  2,589  |  2,589  |  2,589   \nDeferred income taxes, net  |  9,300  |  11,345  |  9,137  |  9,383  |  9,395   \nOther assets  |  22,811  |  23,623  |  24,326  |  22,417  |  29,326   \n**Total assets** |  $  |  3,161,080  |  $  |  3,141,654  |  $  |  3,155,274  |  $  |  3,215,482  |  $  |  3,249,776   \n**LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY**  \nLiabilities   \nDeposits   \nNoninterest bearing deposits  |  $  |  293,195  |  $  |  328,475  |  $  |  376,248  |  $  |  346,172  |  $  |  345,433   \nInterest bearing deposits  |  2,394,976  |  2,333,900  |  2,297,274  |  2,390,585  |  2,423,193   \nTotal deposits  |  2,688,171  |  2,662,375  |  2,673,522  |  2,736,757  |  2,768,626   \nAdvances from the Federal Home Loan Bank  |  90,000  |  90,000  |  90,000  |  90,000  |  90,000   \nSubordinated debentures  |  69,389  |  69,328  |  69,266  |  69,205  |  69,143   \nAccrued expenses and other liabilities  |  45,594  |  52,975  |  54,454  |  53,768  |  64,145   \n**Total liabilities** |  2,893,154  |  2,874,678  |  2,887,242  |  2,949,730  |  2,991,914   \nShareholders’ equity   \nCommon stock, no par value  |  118,429  |  118,037  |  118,401  |  118,247  |  117,181   \nRetained earnings  |  151,257  |  150,895  |  151,350  |  149,169  |  142,205   \nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss)  |  (1,760  |  )  |  (1,956  |  )  |  (1,719  |  )  |  (1,664  |  )  |  (1,524  |  )   \n**Total shareholders’ equity** |  267,926  |  266,976  |  268,032  |  265,752  |  257,862   \n**Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity** |  $  |  3,161,080  |  $  |  3,141,654  |  $  |  3,155,274  |  $  |  3,215,482  |  $  |  3,249,776   \n**BANKWELL FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBankwell Financial Group, Inc. (the \"Parent Corporation\") is a bank holding company headquartered in New Canaan, Connecticut. The Parent Corporation offers a\nbroad range of financial services through its banking subsidiary, Bankwell Bank (the \"Bank\" and, collectively with the Parent Corporation and the Parent\nCorporation's subsidiaries, \"we\", \"our\", \"us\", or the \"Company\").\nThe Bank is a Connecticut state chartered commercial bank, founded in 2002, whose deposits are insured under the Deposit Insurance Fund administered by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). The Bank provides a wide range of services to clients in our market, an area encompassing approximately a 100\nmile radius around our branch network. In addition, the Bank pursues certain types of commercial lending opportunities outside our market, particularly where we\nhave strong business relationships. The Bank operates branches in New Canaan, Stamford, Fairfield, Westport, Darien, Norwalk, and Hamden, Connecticut.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Bank, including its wholly owned passive investment company subsidiary. All\nsignificant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and general\npractices within the banking industry. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, and revenue and expenses\nfor the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to\nthe allowance for credit losses, the valuation of derivative instruments, investment securities valuation, evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary\nimpairment and deferred income taxes valuation.\nSegments\nThe Company has one reportable segment. All of the Company’s activities are interrelated, and each activity is dependent and assessed based on how each of the\nactivities of the Company supports the others. For example, lending is dependent upon the ability of the Company to fund itself with deposits and borrowings while\nmanaging the interest rate and credit risk. Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment or unit.\nBasis of consolidated financial statement presentation\nThe unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) for\nquarterly reports on Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by GAAP. In the opinion\nof management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) and disclosures considered necessary for the fair presentation of the accompanying\nunaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been included. Interim results are not necessarily reflective of the results that may be expected for the\nyear ending December 31, 2024. The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited\nconsolidated financial statements and notes thereto included on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nSignificant concentrations of credit risk\nMany of the Company's activities are with clients located in Connecticut and New York, with the majority of the Company's commercial real estate investor loans\nin Connecticut and some New York metro area counties. Declines in property values in these areas could significantly impact the Company. The Company has a\nsignificant concentration in commercial real estate loans, with a growing percentage being owner-occupied, which present a lower risk profile.\nACL-Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses-Unfunded Commitments (\"ACL-Unfunded Commitments\")\nThe ACL-Loans is measured on each loan’s amortized cost basis, excluding interest receivable, and is initially recognized upon origination or purchase of the loan,\nand subsequently remeasured on a recurring basis. The ACL-Loans is recognized as a contra-asset, and credit loss expense is recorded as a provision for loan losses\nin the consolidated statements of income. Loan\n11\nlosses are charged off against the ACL-Loans when management believes the loan is uncollectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the ACL-Loans.\nLoans are normally placed on nonaccrual status if it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest when due\naccording to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, or the loan is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the obligation is well-secured and is in the\nprocess of collection. The Company generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses (\"ACL\") on accrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy\nto reverse interest income when interest is 90 days or more past due.\nThe Company also records an ACL-Unfunded commitments, which is based on the same assumptions as funded loans and also\nconsiders the probability of funding. The ACL is recognized as a liability, and credit loss expense is recorded as a provision for\nunfunded loan commitments within the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated statements of income.\nFor collectively evaluated loans and related unfunded commitments, the Company utilizes software provided by a third party, which includes various models for\nforecasting expected credit losses, to calculate its ACL. Management selected lifetime loss rate models, utilizing CRE, C&I, and Consumer specific models, to\ncalculate the expected losses over the life of each loan based on exposure at default, loan attributes and reasonable, supportable economic forecasts. The models\nselected by the Company in its ACL calculation rely upon historical losses from a broad cross section of U.S. banks that also utilize the same third party for ACL\ncalculations. Management reviewed the third party’s analysis of the banks included in the models as part of their model development dataset and determined the\nCompany’s loan portfolio composition by property type, balance distribution by loan age, and delinquency status are similar, which supports the use of these loss\nrate models. The Company also noted the third party’s model development dataset has loan concentrations that are evenly distributed across the United States,\nwhile the Company’s portfolio is mainly concentrated in the Northeast. Based on the disparate regional concentration, management determined that a select group\nof peer banks is necessary to scale the loss rate models to produce an ACL that is more representative of the Company’s loan portfolio. This peer-based calibration,\ncalled a \"scalar\", utilizes the loss rates of a subset of peer banks to appropriately scale the initial model results. These peers have been selected by the Company\ngiven their similar characteristics, such as loan portfolio composition and location, to better align the models’ results to the Company’s expected losses.\nKey assumptions used in the models include portfolio segmentation, risk rating, forecasted economic scenarios, the peer scalar, and the expected utilization of\nunfunded commitments, among others. Our loan portfolios are segmented by loan level attributes such as loan type, size, date of origination, and delinquency\nstatus to create homogenous loan pools. Pool level metrics are calculated, and loss rates are subsequently applied to the pools as the loans have similar\ncharacteristics.\nTo account for economic uncertainty, the Company incorporates multiple economic scenarios in determining the ACL. The scenarios include various projections\nbased on variables such as Gross Domestic Product, interest rates, property price indices, and employment measures, among others. The scenarios are probability-\nweighted based on available information at the time the calculation is conducted. As part of our ongoing governance of ACL, scenario weightings and model\nparameters are reviewed periodically by management and are subject to change, as deemed appropriate.\nThe Company also considers qualitative adjustments to expected credit loss estimates for information not already captured in the quantitative loss estimation\nmodels. Qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease management’s estimate of expected credit losses. Qualitative loss factors are based on the\nCompany’s judgment of market, changes in loan composition or concentrations, performance trends, regulatory changes, uncertainty of macroeconomic forecasts,\nand other asset specific risk characteristics.\nWhen loans do not share risk characteristics with other financial assets they are evaluated individually. Management applies its normal loan review procedures in\nmaking these judgments. Individually evaluated loans consist of loans with credit quality indicators which are substandard or doubtful. The Company also\nindividually evaluates all insurance premium loans. While insurance premium loans are considered consumer loans, the third-party Consumer ACL model is\ndesigned for unsecured lending, whereas these loans are secured. To account for the fully secured structure of this type of loan, management determined each loan\nwill be individually evaluated, regardless of the credit quality indicators. These loans are evaluated based upon their collateral, which primarily consists of cash,\ncash surrender value life insurance, and in some cases real estate. In determining the ACL-Loans for individually evaluated loans, the Company generally applies a\ndiscounted cash flow method for instruments that are individually assessed. For collateral dependent financial assets where the Company has determined that\nforeclosure of the collateral is probable and where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair\nvalue of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the asset as of the measurement date. Fair value is generally calculated based on the value of the underlying\ncollateral less an appraisal discount and the estimated cost to sell.\n12\nACL-Securities\nThe Company individually evaluates the available for sale debt securities and held to maturity securities for impairment credit losses. Available for sale securities\ninclude U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate bonds. U.S. Treasuries and mortgaged-backed securities are guaranteed by the U.S. Government\nand as a result, management has a zero loss expectation. No ACL-Securities was recorded for these securities as of September 30, 2024. For the corporate bond\nportfolio, the Company developed a metric that includes each issuer’s current credit ratings and key financial performance metrics to assess the underlying\nperformance of each issuer. The analysis of the issuers’ performance and the intent of the Company to retain these securities support the determination that there is\nno expected credit loss, and therefore, no ACL-Securities was recognized on the corporate bond portfolio as of September 30, 2024. Of our held to maturity\nsecurities portfolio, one security’s fair value was less than its amortized cost as of September 30, 2024. Since this is a highly rated state agency and municipal\nobligation, the Company's expectation of nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero. No allowance for ACL-Securities was recorded for this security as of\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nCommon share repurchases\nThe Company is incorporated in the state of Connecticut. Connecticut law does not provide for treasury shares, rather shares repurchased by the Company\nconstitute authorized, but unissued shares. GAAP states that accounting for treasury stock shall conform to state law. Therefore, the cost of shares repurchased by\nthe Company has been allocated to common stock balances.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts may be reclassified to conform to the 2024 financial statement presentation. These reclassifications only change the reporting\ncategories and do not affect the consolidated results of operations or consolidated financial position of the Company.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThe following section includes changes in accounting principles and potential effects of new accounting guidance and pronouncements.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\nASU No. 2023-09—Income Taxes (Topic 740): \"Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\": The amendments in this update provide more transparency about\nincome tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. For public\nbusiness entities, the amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company believes this ASU will not have\na material impact on existing disclosures and will continue to monitor for SEC action, and plan accordingly for adoption.\nASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: “Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative”: The\namendments in this Update modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of Topics in the Codification. Certain of the amendments represent\nclarifications to or technical corrections of the current requirements. Because of the variety of Topics amended, a broad range of entities may be affected by one or\nmore of those amendments. The summary of the amendments applicable to the Company include:\nStatement of Cash Flows - Requires an accounting policy disclosure in annual periods of where cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related\ngains and losses are presented in the statement of cash flows.\nAccounting Changes and Error Corrections - Requires that when there has been a change in the reporting entity, the entity disclose any material prior-period\nadjustment and the effect of the adjustment on retained earnings in interim financial statements.\nEarnings Per Share - Requires disclosure of the methods used in the diluted earnings-per-share computation for each dilutive security and clarifies that certain\ndisclosures should be made during interim periods. Amends illustrative guidance to illustrate\ndisclosure of the methods used in the diluted earnings-per-share computation.\nInterim Reporting - Conforms to the amendments made to Topic 250 (Accounting Changes and Error Correction).\nCommitments - Requires disclosure of assets mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise subject to lien and the obligations collateralized.\n13\nDebt - Requires disclosure of amounts and terms of unused lines of credit and unfunded commitments and the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding short-\nterm borrowings. Entities that are not public business entities are not required to provide information about the weighted-average interest rate.\nEquity - Requires entities that issue preferred stock to disclose preference in involuntary liquidation if the liquidation preference is other than par or stated value.\nDerivatives - Adds cross-reference to disclosure requirements related to where cash flows associated with derivative instruments and their related gains and losses\nare presented in the statement of cash flows in Topic 230.\nTransfers and Servicing—Secured Borrowing and Collateral - Requires:\na. That accrued interest be included in the disclosure of liabilities incurred in securities borrowing or repurchase or resale transactions.\nb. Separate presentation of the aggregate carrying amount of reverse repurchase agreements on the face of the balance sheet if that amount exceeds 10\npercent of total assets.\nc. Disclosure of the weighted-average interest rates of repurchase liabilities for public business entities.\nd. Disclosure of amounts at risk with an individual counterparty if that amount exceeds more than 10 percent of shareholder’s equity.\ne. Disclosure for reverse repurchase agreements that exceed 10 percent of total assets on whether there are any provisions in a reverse repurchase\nagreement to ensure that the market value of the underlying assets remains sufficient. to protect against counterparty default and, if so, the nature of those\nprovisions.\nFinancial Services - Requires that investment companies disclose the components of capital on the balance sheet.\nFor entities subject to the SEC’s existing disclosure requirements and for entities required to file or furnish financial statements with or to the SEC in preparation\nfor the sale of or for purposes of issuing securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer, the effective date for each amendment will be the date\non which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. For all other\nentities, the amendments will be effective two years later. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively. For all entities, if by June 30, 2027, the\nSEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the related amendment will be removed from the\nCodification and will not become effective for any entity. The Company believes this ASU will not have a material impact on existing disclosures and will continue\nto monitor for SEC action, and plan accordingly for adoption.\n14\n2.

Loans Receivable and ACL-Loans\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the loan portfolio at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\n(In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nReal estate loans:\nResidential $ 45,553 $ 50,931\nCommercial 1,887,942 1,947,648\nConstruction 160,292 183,414\n2,093,787 2,181,993\nCommercial business 490,292 500,569\nConsumer 39,126 36,045\nTotal loans 2,623,205 2,718,607\nACL-Loans (27,752) (27,946)\nDeferred loan origination fees, net (3,902) (5,360)\nLoans receivable, net $ 2,591,551 $ 2,685,301\nLending activities primarily consist of commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans and, to a lesser degree, consumer loans. Loans may also be granted\nfor the construction of commercial properties. The majority of commercial mortgage loans are collateralized by first or second mortgages on real estate.\nRisk management\nThe Company has established credit policies applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of each\nclient and extends credit of up to 80% of the market value of the collateral, (85% maximum for owner occupied commercial real estate), depending on the client's\ncreditworthiness and the type of collateral. The client’s ability to service the debt is monitored on an ongoing basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral.\nOther important forms of collateral are business assets, time deposits and marketable securities. While collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of\nrepayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment for commercial loans to be based on the client’s ability to generate continuing cash\nflows. The Company does not provide first or second lien residential mortgage loans secured by residential properties but has a small legacy portfolio which\ncontinues to amortize, pay off due to the sale of the collateral, or refinance away from the Company.\n18\nCredit quality of loans and the Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans (ACL-Loans)\nManagement segregates the loan portfolio into defined segments, which are used to develop and document a systematic method for determining the Company's\nACL-Loans. The portfolio segments are segregated based on loan types and the underlying risk factors present in each loan type. Such risk factors are periodically\nreviewed by management and revised as deemed appropriate.\nThe Company's loan portfolio is segregated into the following portfolio segments:\nResidential Real Estate: This portfolio segment consists of first mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family owner occupied residential properties for\npersonal use located in the Company's market area. This segment also includes home equity loans and home equity lines of credit secured by owner occupied\none-to-four family residential properties. Loans of this type were written at a combined maximum of 80% of the appraised value of the property and the\nCompany requires a first or second lien position on the property. These loans can be affected by economic conditions and the values of the underlying\nproperties.\nCommercial Real Estate: This portfolio segment includes loans secured by commercial real estate, multi-family dwellings, owner-occupied commercial real\nestate and investor-owned one-to-four family dwellings. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have larger loan balances and more credit risk than\nowner occupied one-to-four family mortgage loans.\nConstruction: This portfolio segment includes commercial construction loans for commercial development projects, including apartment buildings and\ncondominiums, as well as office buildings, retail and other income producing properties and land loans, which are loans made with land as collateral.\nConstruction and land development financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied or leased real\nestate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction\ncompared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, the\nCompany may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the\nestimated value of the completed project proves to be inaccurate, the client may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment\nthrough sale or refinance. Construction loans also expose the Company to the risks that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with\nspecifications and projected costs and that repayment will depend on the successful operation or sale of the properties, which may cause some clients to be\nunable to continue paying debt service, which exposes the Company to greater risk of non-payment and loss.\nCommercial Business: This portfolio segment includes commercial business loans secured by assignments of corporate assets and personal guarantees of the\nbusiness owners. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates and shorter terms than other loans, and their repayment generally depends on\nthe successful operation of the client’s business.\nConsumer: This portfolio segment includes loans secured by savings or certificate accounts, as well as unsecured personal loans and overdraft lines of credit.\nIn addition, there are loans to finance insurance premiums, secured primarily by the cash surrender value of life insurance and marketable securities.\n19\nACL-Loans\nThe following tables set forth the activity in the Company’s ACL-Loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, by portfolio\nsegment:\nResidential Real Commercial Commercial\nEstate Real Estate Construction Business Consumer Total\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBeginning balance $ 123 $ 22,473 $ 2,272 $ 10,647 $ 568 $ 36,083\nCharge-offs — (8,184) (616) (7,010) (17) (15,827)\nRecoveries — 1,013 — (34) 1 980\n(Credit) provision for credit losses (21) 6,676 (51) (83) (5) 6,516\nEnding balance $ 102 $ 21,978 $ 1,605 $ 3,520 $ 547 $ 27,752\nResidential Real Commercial Commercial\nEstate Real Estate Construction Business Consumer Total\n(In thousands)\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 190 $ 19,948 $ 1,798 $ 6,788 $ 1,970 $ 30,694\nCharge-offs — — — — (32) (32)\nRecoveries — — — 35 20 55\n(Credit) provision for credit losses (29) 788 (183) (639) (1,370) (1,433)\nEnding balance $ 161 $ 20,736 $ 1,615 $ 6,184 $ 588 $ 29,284\nResidential Real Commercial Real Commercial\nEstate Estate Construction Business Consumer Total\n(In thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nBeginning balance $ 149 $ 20,950 $ 1,699 $ 4,562 $ 586 $ 27,946\nCharge-offs (141) (12,012) (616) (7,207) (78) (20,054)\nRecoveries 141 1,126 — (7) 18 1,278\n(Credit) provision for credit losses (47) 11,914 522 6,172 21 18,582\nEnding balance $ 102 $ 21,978 $ 1,605 $ 3,520 $ 547 $ 27,752\nResidential Real Commercial Real Commercial\nEstate Estate Construction Business Consumer Total\n(In thousands)\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2023\nBeginning balance $ 163 $ 15,597 $ 311 $ 6,214 $ 146 $ 22,431\nDay1 effect of CECL 80 4,987 611 (1,125) 526 5,079\nBalance as of January 1, 2023 as\nadjusted for changes in accounting\nprinciple 243 20,584 922 5,089 672 27,510\nCharge-offs — — — (439) (69) (508)\nRecoveries — — — 68 35 103\n(Credit) provision for credit losses (82) 152 693 1,466 (50) 2,179\nEnding balance $ 161 $ 20,736 $ 1,615 $ 6,184 $ 588 $ 29,284\n20\nWe evaluate whether a modification, extension or renewal of a loan is a current period origination in accordance with GAAP.

measure credit risk for the loan portfolios, the Company employs a credit risk rating system. This risk rating represents an assessed level of a loan’s risk based\non the character and creditworthiness of the borrower/guarantor, the capacity of the borrower to adequately service the debt, any credit enhancements or additional\nsources of repayment, and the quality, value and coverage of the collateral, if any.\n24\nThe objectives of the Company’s risk rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall\nquality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize a\npotential credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential\ninformation for determining the adequacy of the ACL-Loans. The Company’s credit risk rating system has nine grades, with each grade corresponding to a\nprogressively greater risk of default or non-payment. Risk ratings of (1) through (5) are \"pass\" categories and risk ratings of (6) through (9) are criticized asset\ncategories as defined by the regulatory agencies.\nA “special mention” (6) loan has a potential weakness which, if uncorrected, may result in a deterioration of the repayment prospects or inadequately protect the\nCompany’s credit position at some time in the future. “Substandard” (7) loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the full repayment of\nthe debt. A loan rated “doubtful” (8) has all the weaknesses inherent in a substandard loan and which, in addition, make collection or liquidation in full highly\nquestionable and improbable when considering existing facts, conditions, and values. Loans classified as “loss” (9) are considered uncollectible and of such little\nvalue that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value; rather,\nit is not practical or desirable to defer writing-off this asset even though partial recovery may be made in the future.\nRisk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. They are reviewed on an ongoing basis through the annual loan review process\nperformed by Company personnel, normal renewal activity, monthly delinquency monitoring, and the quarterly watchlist and watched asset report process. They\nare revised to reflect changes in the borrower's financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and\ncoverage, as well as other considerations. In addition to internal review at multiple points, outsourced loan review opines on risk ratings with regard to the sample\nof loans their review covers.\nThe following tables present credit risk ratings by loan segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nCommercial Credit Quality Indicators\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCommercial Commercial Commercial Commercial\nReal Estate Construction Business Total Real Estate Construction Business Total\n(In thousands)\nPass $ 1,754,446 $ 151,526 $ 471,252 $ 2,377,224 $ 1,835,136 $ 174,032 $ 476,358 $ 2,485,526\nSpecial Mention 87,136 — 9,445 96,581 62,577 — 4,362 66,939\nSubstandard 44,955 8,766 9,530 63,251 43,542 9,382 19,745 72,669\nDoubtful 1,405 — 65 1,470 6,393 — 104 6,497\nLoss — — — — — — — —\nTotal loans $ 1,887,942 $ 160,292 $ 490,292 $ 2,538,526 $ 1,947,648 $ 183,414 $ 500,569 $ 2,631,631\nResidential and Consumer Credit Quality Indicators\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nResidential Real Residential Real\nEstate Consumer Total Estate Consumer Total\n(In thousands)\nPass $ 41,828 $ 39,126 $ 80,954 $ 47,082 $ 36,045 $ 83,127\nSpecial Mention 133 — 133 138 — 138\nSubstandard 3,592 — 3,592 3,711 — 3,711\nDoubtful — — — — — —\nLoss — — — — — —\nTotal loans $ 45,553 $ 39,126 $ 84,679 $ 50,931 $ 36,045 $ 86,976\n25\nLoan portfolio aging analysis\nWhen a loan is 15 days past due, the Company sends the borrower a late notice. The Company attempts to contact the borrower by phone if the delinquency is not\ncorrected promptly after the notice has been sent. When the loan is 30 days past due, the Company mails the borrower a letter reminding the borrower of the\ndelinquency and attempts to contact the borrower personally to determine the reason for the delinquency and ensure the borrower understands the terms of the loan.\nIf necessary, after the 90th day of delinquency, the Company may take other appropriate legal action. A summary report of all loans 30 days or more past due is\nprovided to the Board of Directors of the Company periodically. Loans greater than 90 days past due are generally put on nonaccrual status. A nonaccrual loan is\nrestored to accrual status when it is no longer delinquent and collectability of interest and principal is no longer in doubt. A loan is considered to be no longer\ndelinquent when timely payments are made for a period of at least six months (one year for loans providing for quarterly or semi-annual payments) by the borrower\nin accordance with the contractual terms.\nThe following tables set forth certain information with respect to the Company's loan portfolio delinquencies by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024\n90 Days or\n30-59 Days 60-89 Days Greater Past\nPast Due Past Due Due Total Past Due Current Total Loans\n(In thousands)\nReal estate loans:\nResidential real estate $ 705 $ — $ 1,172 $ 1,877 $ 43,676 $ 45,553\nCommercial real estate 5,061 9,474 28,489 43,024 1,844,918 1,887,942\nConstruction — — 8,766 8,766 151,526 160,292\nCommercial business 523 853 9,897 11,273 479,019 490,292\nConsumer — — — — 39,126 39,126\nTotal loans $ 6,289 $ 10,327 $ 48,324 $ 64,940 $ 2,558,265 $ 2,623,205\nDecember 31, 2023\n90 Days or\n30-59 Days 60-89 Days Greater Past\nPast Due Past Due Due Total Past Due Current Total Loans\n(In thousands)\nReal estate loans:\nResidential real estate $ — $ 1,220 $ 132 $ 1,352 $ 49,579 $ 50,931\nCommercial real estate 195 282 1,851 2,328 1,945,320 1,947,648\nConstruction — — 9,382 9,382 174,032 183,414\nCommercial business 6,568 1,648 — 8,216 492,353 500,569\nConsumer — — — — 36,045 36,045\nTotal loans $ 6,763 $ 3,150 $ 11,365 $ 21,278 $ 2,697,329 $ 2,718,607\nThere was one loan greater than 90 days delinquent and still accruing interest as of September 30, 2024.

Individually evaluated loans are individually evaluated for impairment. When the Company classifies a problem\nloan as impaired, it evaluates whether a specific valuation allowance is required for that portion of the asset that is estimated to be impaired.\nThe Company also individually evaluated all insurance premium loans within the Consumer portfolio segment, irrespective of credit risk ratings.\n27\nThe following table summarizes individually evaluated loans by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nCarrying Amount Unpaid Principal Balance Associated ACL-Loans\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n2024 December 31, 2023 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nIndividually evaluated loans\nwithout a valuation\nallowance:\nResidential real estate $ 3,593 $ 3,711 $ 3,896 $ 4,022 $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate 46,360 43,942 56,338 45,032 — —\nConstruction 8,766 9,382 9,382 9,382 — —\nCommercial business 8,985 19,848 17,196 20,502 — —\nConsumer 26,697 22,129 26,697 22,129 — —\nTotal individually\nevaluated loans without a\nvaluation allowance 94,401 99,012 113,509 101,067 — —\nIndividually evaluated loans\nwith a valuation allowance:\nResidential real estate $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate — 5,993 — 6,017 — 955\nConstruction — — — — — —\nCommercial business 610 — 694 — 3 —\nConsumer — — — — — —\nTotal individually\nevaluated loans with a\nvaluation allowance 610 5,993 694 6,017 3 955\nTotal individually\nevaluated loans $ 95,011 $ 105,005 $ 114,203 $ 107,084 $ 3 $ 955\n28\nThe following table summarizes the average carrying amount of individually evaluated loans and interest income recognized on individually evaluated loans by\nportfolio segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nAverage Carrying Amount Interest Income Recognized\nThree Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nIndividually evaluated loans without a valuation allowance:\nResidential real estate $ 3,606 $ 3,760 $ 52 $ 28\nCommercial real estate 52,072 1,900 287 —\nCommercial business 13,703 6,387 128 48\nConstruction 9,176 9,382 — —\nConsumer 26,477 8,981 363 —\nTotal individually evaluated loans without a valuation allowance 105,034 30,410 830 76\nIndividually evaluated loans with a valuation allowance:\nResidential real estate $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate — 21,934 — 87\nConstruction — — — —\nCommercial business 629 3,092 11 —\nConsumer — — — —\nTotal individually evaluated loans with a valuation allowance 629 25,026 11 87\nTotal individually evaluated loans $ 105,663 $ 55,436 $ 841 $ 163\n29\nAverage Carrying Amount Interest Income Recognized\nNine Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands)\nIndividually evaluated loans without a valuation allowance:\nResidential real estate $ 3,640 $ 3,798 $ 142 $ 68\nCommercial real estate 54,621 1,908 1,674 —\nCommercial business 15,280 5,068 1,615 132\nConstruction 9,313 9,382 — —\nConsumer 26,052 7,144 1,050 —\nTotal individually evaluated loans without a valuation allowance 108,906 27,300 4,481 200\nIndividually evaluated loans with a valuation allowance:\nResidential real estate $ — $ — $ — $ —\nCommercial real estate — 21,996 — 260\nCommercial business 647 1,470 38 —\nConstruction — — — —\nConsumer — — — —\nTotal individually evaluated loans with a valuation allowance 647 23,466 38 260\nTotal individually evaluated loans $ 109,553 $ 50,766 $ 4,519 $ 460\nLoan Modifications\nA loan will be considered modified as defined by ASU 2022-02 when both of the following conditions are met: 1) the borrower is experiencing financial\ndifficulties and 2) the modification constitutes a direct change in contractual cash flows for a significant period of time.

Shareholders' Equity\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has 10,000,000 shares authorized and 7,858,573 shares issued and outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 10,000,000 shares authorized and\n7,882,616 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2023. The Company's stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the ticker symbol BWFG.\nDividends\nThe Company’s shareholders are entitled to dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available. The ability of the Company to\npay dividends depends, in part, on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Corporation. In accordance with Connecticut statutes, regulatory approval\nis required to pay dividends in excess of the Bank’s profits retained in the current year plus retained profits from the previous two years. The Bank is also\nprohibited from paying dividends that would reduce its capital ratios below minimum regulatory requirements.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn December 19, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (\"Prior Plan\") of up to 400,000 shares of the Company's\ncommon Stock and, on October 27, 2021, the Company’ Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200,000 shares under the Prior Plan. During\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company purchased 85,990 shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of $24.82. During the year\nended December 31, 2023, the Company had no purchases of common stock. To date, the Company has purchased 535,802 shares of the Company’s common\nstock pursuant to the Prior Plan.\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company announced that on October 23, 2024, its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan (\"New Plan\"). Under the terms\nof the New Plan, the Company is authorized to buy back up to 250,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. In connection with the authorization of the New\nPlan, the Company terminated the Prior Plan.\nThe Company intends to accomplish the share repurchases under the New Plan through open market transactions, although the Company could accomplish\nrepurchases through other means, such as privately negotiated transactions. The timing, price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions,\nrelevant securities laws (such as 10b-18 and 10b5-1 rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and other factors. The New Plan does not obligate the\nCompany to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The Company expects\nto fund any repurchases from cash on hand.\n5. Comprehensive Income\nComprehensive income represents the sum of net income and items of other comprehensive income or loss, including net unrealized gains or losses on securities\navailable for sale and net unrealized gains or losses on derivatives. The Company's derivative instruments are utilized to manage economic risks, including interest\nrate risk. Changes in fair value of the Company's cash flow swap derivatives are primarily driven by changes in interest rates and recognized in other\ncomprehensive income. The Company’s total comprehensive income or loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is\nreported in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n31\nThe following tables present the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income by component, net of tax for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\non Available for Sale Net Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nSecurities on Interest Rate Swaps Total\n(In thousands)\nBalance at June 30, 2024 $ (5,622) $ 3,666 $ (1,956)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net of\ntax 2,050 (1,338) 712\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome, net of tax — (516) (516)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) 2,050 (1,854) 196\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (3,572) $ 1,812 $ (1,760)\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\non Available for Sale Net Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nSecurities on Interest Rate Swaps Total\n(In thousands)\nBalance at June 30, 2023 $ (7,611) $ 5,895 $ (1,716)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications, net of\ntax (579) 1,718 1,139\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome, net of tax — (947) (947)\nNet other comprehensive (loss) income (579) 771 192\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (8,190) $ 6,666 $ (1,524)\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\non Available for Sale Net Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nSecurities on Interest Rate Swaps Total\n(In thousands)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ (5,810) $ 4,146 $ (1,664)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net of\ntax 2,238 357 2,595\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome, net of tax — (2,691) (2,691)\nNet other comprehensive income (loss) 2,238 (2,334) (96)\nBalance at September 30, 2024 $ (3,572) $ 1,812 $ (1,760)\nNet Unrealized Gain (Loss)\non Available for Sale Net Unrealized Gain (Loss)\nSecurities on Interest Rate Swaps Total\n(In thousands)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ (6,750) $ 6,561 $ (189)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications, net of\ntax (1,440) 1,696 256\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive\nincome, net of tax — (1,591) (1,591)\nNet other comprehensive (loss) income (1,440) 105 (1,335)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 $ (8,190) $ 6,666 $ (1,524)\n32\nThe following table provides information for the items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Associated Line Item in the Consolidated\nIncome Components 2024 2023 2024 2023 Statements of Income\n(In thousands)\nDerivatives:\nUnrealized gains (losses) on derivatives $ 1,087 $ 1,229 $ 3,601 $ 3,323 Interest expense on borrowings\nTax (expense) benefit (257) (282) (908) (1,732) Income tax expense\nNet of tax $ 830 $ 947 $ 2,693 $ 1,591\n6. Earnings per share (\"EPS\")\nUnvested restricted stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and are included in the computation of EPS pursuant to\nthe two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common stock and participating security\naccording to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company’s unvested restricted stock awards qualify as\nparticipating securities.\nNet income is allocated between the common stock and participating securities pursuant to the two-class method. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding participating unvested restricted\nstock awards.\nDiluted EPS is computed in a similar manner, except that the denominator includes the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if\npotentially dilutive common shares were issued using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table is a reconciliation of earnings available to common shareholders and basic weighted average common shares outstanding to diluted weighted\naverage common shares outstanding, reflecting the application of the two-class method:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNet income $ 1,926 $ 9,777 $ 6,807 $ 28,139\nDividends to participating securities(1) (38) (41) (117) (125)\nUndistributed earnings allocated to participating securities(1) (9) (209) (53) (613)\nNet income for earnings per share calculation $ 1,879 $ 9,527 $ 6,637 $ 27,401\nWeighted average shares outstanding, basic 7,715 7,598 7,709 7,582\nEffect of dilutive equity-based awards(2) 6 36 22 65\nWeighted average shares outstanding, diluted 7,721 7,634 7,731 7,647\nNet earnings per common share:\nBasic earnings per common share $ 0.24 $ 1.25 $ 0.86 $ 3.61\nDiluted earnings per common share $ 0.24 $ 1.25 $ 0.86 $ 3.58\n(1) Represents dividends paid and undistributed earnings allocated to unvested stock-based awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends.\n(2) Represents the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted shares, as applicable, utilizing the treasury stock method.\n33\n7. Regulatory Matters\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the other federal and state bank regulatory agencies establish regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations.\nUnder the current guidelines, banking organizations must have a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%,\na minimum Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% in order to be \"adequately capitalized.\" In addition to\nthese requirements, banking organizations must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of common equity in an amount above the minimum risk-based\ncapital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, resulting in a requirement for the Bank to effectively\nmaintain Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. The Bank must maintain the capital conservation buffer to\navoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, or to engage in share repurchases.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company no longer met the definition of a Small Bank Holding Company as the Company's assets exceeded $3 billion. Effective March\n31, 2024, the Company is subject to the larger company capital requirements as set forth in the Economic Growth Act.\nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could\nhave a direct material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Bank and Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. There are no conditions or events since then\nthat management believes have changed this conclusion.\nThe capital amounts and ratios for the Bank and the Company at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nMinimum Regulatory Capital Minimum Regulatory Capital\nRequired for Capital to be Well Capitalized Under\nAdequacy plus Capital Prompt Corrective Action\nActual Capital Conservation Buffer Provisions\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nBankwell Bank\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 323,558 11.80 % $ 192,019 7.00 % $ 178,304 6.50 %\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 351,815 12.83 % 288,029 10.50 % 274,313 10.00 %\nTier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 323,558 11.80 % 233,166 8.50 % 219,451 8.00 %\nTier I Capital to Average Assets 323,558 10.24 % 126,432 4.00 % 158,040 5.00 %\nMinimum Regulatory Capital\nMinimum Regulatory Capital to be Well Capitalized Under\nRequired for Capital Prompt Corrective Action\nActual Capital Adequacy Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nBankwell Financial Group, Inc.\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 266,640 9.70 % $ 123,640 4.50 % $ 178,591 6.50 %\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 364,287 13.26 % 219,804 8.00 % 274,755 10.00 %\nTier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 266,640 9.70 % 164,853 6.00 % 219,804 8.00 %\nTier I Capital to Average Assets 266,640 8.44 % 126,432 4.00 % 158,040 5.00 %\n34\nMinimum Regulatory Capital Minimum Regulatory Capital\nRequired for Capital to be Well Capitalized Under\nAdequacy plus Capital Prompt Corrective Action\nActual Capital Conservation Buffer Provisions\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nBankwell Bank\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 321,432 11.30 % $ 199,047 7.00 % $ 184,829 6.50 %\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 350,303 12.32 % 298,571 10.50 % 284,353 10.00 %\nTier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 321,432 11.30 % 241,700 8.50 % 227,482 8.00 %\nTier I Capital to Average Assets 321,432 9.81 % 131,110 4.00 % 163,888 5.00 %\nMinimum Regulatory Capital\nMinimum Regulatory Capital to be Well Capitalized Under\nRequired for Capital Prompt Corrective Action\nActual Capital Adequacy Provisions\nAmount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio\nBankwell Financial Group, Inc.\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets $ 264,209 9.28 % $ 128,121 4.50 % N/A N/A\nTotal Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 362,285 12.72 % 227,770 8.00 % N/A N/A\nTier I Capital to Risk-Weighted Assets 264,209 9.28 % 170,828 6.00 % N/A N/A\nTier I Capital to Average Assets 264,209 8.05 % 131,232 4.00 % N/A N/A\nRegulatory Restrictions on Dividends\nThe ability of the Company to pay dividends depends, in part, on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Parent Corporation.

Stock-Based Compensation\nEquity award plans\nThe Company has unvested restricted stock outstanding under three equity award plans, which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans”. The current plan\nunder which any future issuances of equity awards will be made is the 2022 Bankwell Financial Group, Inc. Stock Plan, or the “2022 Plan”. All equity awards\nmade under the 2022 Plan are made by means of an award agreement, which contains the specific terms and conditions of the grant. To date, all equity awards have\nbeen in the form of restricted stock. At September 30, 2024, there were 275,588 shares reserved for future issuance under the 2022 Plan.\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provides grantees with rights to shares of common stock upon completion of a service period. Shares of unvested restricted stock\nare considered participating securities. Restricted stock awards generally vest over one to five years.\nThe following table presents the activity for restricted stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2024\nWeighted Average Grant\nNumber of Shares Date Fair Value\nUnvested at beginning of period 254,328 (1) $ 29.58\nGranted 66,209 (2) 25.61\nVested (88,672)(3) 26.36\nForfeited (4,262) 25.40\nUnvested at end of period 227,603\n(1) Includes 33,115 shares of performance based restricted stock.\n(2) Includes 18,598 shares of performance based restricted stock.\n(3) Includes 16,527 shares of performance based restricted stock.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock awards vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $2.3 million.\nThe Company's restricted stock expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $2.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively. At\nSeptember 30, 2024, there was $6.5 million of unrecognized stock compensation expense for restricted stock, expected to be recognized over a weighted average\nperiod of 0.9 years.\nPerformance Based Restricted Stock: The Company has 35,186 shares of performance based restricted stock outstanding as of September 30, 2024 pursuant to the\nCompany’s Stock Plans. The awards vest over a three year service period, provided certain performance metrics are met. The share quantity that ultimately vests\ncan range between 0% and 200%, of the number of performance shares initially granted and is dependent on the degree to which the performance metrics are met.\nThe Company records an expense over the vesting period based on (a) the probability that the performance metric will be met and (b) the fair market value of the\nCompany’s stock at the date of the grant.\n10. Derivative Instruments\nThe Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk, by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its funding along with\nthe use of interest rate derivative financial instruments, namely interest rate swaps. The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. As of\nSeptember 30, 2024, the Company was a party to three cash flow swaps, designated as hedging instruments, to add stability to interest expense and to manage its\nexposure to the variability of the future cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rates. The notional amount for each swap is $25 million and in\neach case, the Company has entered into pay-fixed cash flow swaps to convert rolling 90-day brokered deposits. Cash flow swaps with a positive fair value are\nrecorded as other assets and cash flow swaps with a negative fair value are recorded as other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n37\nThe Company terminated two cash flow swaps with a total notional amount of $50 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The underlying debt\nassociated with the terminated swaps was kept in place. The fair value of the terminated swaps totaled $131.0 thousand as of September 30, 2024. The fair value of\nthe terminated swaps will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the original term of the hedging\nrelationship.\nThe Company entered into one pay-fixed portfolio layer method fair value swap, designated as a hedging instrument, with a total notional amount of $150 million\nin the first quarter of 2023. The Company designated the fair value swap under the portfolio layer method (“PLM”). Under this method, the hedged item is\ndesignated as a hedged layer of a closed portfolio of financial loans that is anticipated to remain outstanding for the designated hedged period. Adjustments will be\nmade to record the swap at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in fair value recognized in interest income. The carrying value of the fair\nvalue swap on the Consolidated Balance Sheets will also be adjusted through interest income, based on changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged\nrisk.\nThe following table represents the carrying value of the portfolio layer method hedged asset and the cumulative fair value hedging adjustment included in the\ncarrying value of the hedged asset as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCarrying Value of Hedged Asset Hedged Items\n(In thousands)\nFixed Rate Asset (1) $ 151,414 $ 150,915 $ 1,414 $ 915\n(1) These amounts include the amortized cost basis of closed portfolios of fixed rate loans used to designate hedging relationships in which the hedged item is the stated amount of assets in the closed\nportfolio anticipated to be outstanding for the designated hedged period. As of September 30, 2024, the amortized cost basis of the closed portfolio used in this hedging relationship was $548.9 million, the\ncumulative basis adjustments associated with this hedging relationships was $0.7 million, and the amount of the designated hedged item was $150.0 million.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company has interest rate swaps not designated as hedging instruments, to minimize interest rate risk exposure with loans to clients.\nThe Company accounts for all non-client related interest rate swaps as either effective cash flow or fair value swaps. None of the interest rate swap agreements\ncontain any credit risk related contingent features. A hedging instrument is expected at inception to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged\ntransactions attributable to the changes in the hedged risk.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain loan clients. The Company executes interest\nrate swaps with commercial banking clients to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by\noffsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the\ninterest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the client derivatives\nand the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.\n38\nInformation about derivative instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:\nAs of September 30, 2024\nDerivative Assets Derivative Liabilities\nOriginal Notional Balance Sheet Original Notional Balance Sheet\nAmount Location Fair Value Amount Location Fair Value\n(In thousands)\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging instruments:\nAccrued expenses and\nInterest rate swaps $ 75,000 Other assets $ 2,238 $ — other liabilities $ —\nAccrued expenses and\nFair value swap $ — Other assets $ — $ 150,000 other liabilities $ 1,416\nDerivatives not designated as\nhedging instruments:\nAccrued expenses and\nInterest rate swaps(1) $ 38,500 Other assets $ 2,877 $ 38,500 other liabilities $ 2,877\n(1) Represents interest rate swaps with commercial banking clients, which are offset by derivatives with a third party.\nAccrued interest receivables related to interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2024 totaled $0.7 million and is excluded from the fair value presented in the table\nabove.

The fair value of interest rate swaps in a net asset position, including accrued interest, totaled $6.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is\nsubsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. The Company expects to\nreclassify $1.3 million to reduce interest expense during the next 12 months.\nThe Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the\nchanges in cash flows of the designated hedged item or transaction. The Company does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities for financial statement\npresentation purposes.\nThe Company assesses the effectiveness of the fair value swap hedge with a regression analysis that compares the changes in forward curves to determine the\nvalue. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges is recorded through interest income. The Company does not\noffset derivative assets and derivative liabilities for financial statement presentation purposes.\n40\nChanges in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of cash flows were as follows for\nthe three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n(In thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges:\nUnrealized (loss) gain recognized in accumulated\nother comprehensive income before reclassifications $ (1,342) $ 2,230 $ 589 $ 3,528\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (1,087) (1,229) (3,601) (3,323)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) on items recognized in\naccumulated other comprehensive income 575 (230) 678 (100)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income $ (1,854) $ 771 $ (2,334) $ 105\nThe above unrealized gains and losses are reflective of market interest rates as of the respective balance sheet dates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nGAAP requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for which it is\npracticable to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation\ntechniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the\nderived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparisons to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of\nthe instrument.\nManagement uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments; however, there are inherent limitations in any estimation\ntechnique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company\ncould have realized in a sales transaction. The estimated fair value amounts have been measured as of the respective period-ends, and have not been reevaluated or\nupdated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial\ninstruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each period-end.\n42\nThe Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the\nCompany’s financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company.\nManagement attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. However, borrowers with fixed\nrate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment. Conversely, depositors who are\nreceiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment.\nManagement monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk.\nThe carrying values, fair values and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023\nwere as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2024\nCarrying Value Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In thousands)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 275,829 $ 275,829 $ 275,829 $ — $ —\nFederal funds sold 15,508 15,508 15,508 — —\nMarketable equity securities 2,148 2,148 2,148 — —\nAvailable for sale securities 108,866 108,866 63,682 45,184 —\nHeld to maturity securities 34,886 31,615 — 30 31,585\nLoans receivable, net 2,591,551 2,569,900 — — 2,569,900\nAccrued interest receivable 14,714 14,714 — 14,714 —\nFHLB stock 5,655 5,655 — 5,655 —\nServicing asset, net of valuation allowance 594 594 — — 594\nDerivative asset 5,115 5,115 — 5,115 —\nFinancial Liabilities:\nNoninterest bearing deposits $ 295,552 $ 295,552 $ — $ 295,552 $ —\nNOW and money market 916,647 981,697 — 981,697 —\nSavings 87,212 87,212 — 87,212 —\nTime deposits 1,388,760 1,394,083 — — 1,394,083\nAccrued interest payable 12,751 12,751 — 12,751 —\nAdvances from the FHLB 90,000 90,057 — — 90,057\nSubordinated debentures 69,389 65,389 — — 65,389\nDerivative liability 4,293 4,293 — 4,293 —\n43\nDecember 31, 2023\nCarrying Value Fair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In thousands)\nFinancial Assets:\nCash and due from banks $ 267,521 $ 267,521 $ 267,521 $ — $ —\nFederal funds sold 1,636 1,636 1,636 — —\nMarketable equity securities 2,070 2,070 2,070 — —\nAvailable for sale securities 109,736 109,736 62,514 47,222 —\nHeld to maturity securities 15,817 15,903 — 33 15,870\nLoans receivable, net 2,685,301 2,659,667 — — 2,659,667\nAccrued interest receivable 14,863 14,863 — 14,863 —\nFHLB stock 5,696 5,696 — 5,696 —\nServicing asset, net of valuation allowance 869 869 — — 869\nDerivative asset 8,819 8,819 — 8,819 —\nFinancial Liabilities:\nNoninterest bearing deposits $ 346,172 $ 346,172 $ — $ 346,172 $ —\nNOW and money market 978,181 978,181 — 978,181 —\nSavings 97,331 97,331 — 97,331 —\nTime deposits 1,315,073 1,315,233 — — 1,315,233\nAccrued interest payable 14,595 14,595 — 14,595 —\nAdvances from the FHLB 90,000 90,012 — — 90,012\nSubordinated debentures 69,205 63,060 — — 63,060\nServicing liability 4 4 — — 4\nDerivative liability 4,496 4,496 — 4,496 —\nThe following methods and assumptions were used by management in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments:\nMarketable equity securities and available for sale securities: Fair values are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market\nprice is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. The majority of the available for sale securities are considered to\nbe Level 2 as other observable inputs are utilized, such as quoted prices for similar securities. Level 1 investment securities include investments in U.S.\nTreasury notes and in marketable equity securities for which a quoted price is readily available in the market. Level 3 held to maturity securities represent\nprivate placement municipal housing authority bonds for which no quoted market price is available. The fair value for these securities is estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model, using discount rates ranging from 4.8% to 6.4% as of September 30, 2024 and 4.5% to 6.9% as of December 31, 2023. These\nsecurities are CRA eligible investments.\nFHLB stock: The carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value based on the most recent redemption provisions of the FHLB.\nLoans receivable: For variable rate loans which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. The\nfair value of fixed rate loans are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar\ncredit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. The fair value methodology includes prepayment, default and loss severity assumptions applied by type of\nloan. The fair value estimate of the loans includes an expected credit loss.\nDerivative asset (liability): The valuation of the Company’s interest rate swaps is obtained from a third-party pricing service and is determined using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The pricing analysis is based on observable inputs for the contractual terms of the\nderivatives, including the period to maturity and\n44\ninterest rate curves. The Company also considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty for assets and the creditworthiness of the Company for liabilities.\nAssets held for sale: Assets held for sale (excluding loans) consist of real estate properties that are expected to sell within a year. The assets are reported at the\nlower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the asset (the exit price).\nDeposits: The fair value of demand deposits, regular savings and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The\nfair value of certificates of deposit and other time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being\noffered for deposits of similar remaining maturities to a schedule of aggregated expected maturities on such deposits.\nBorrowings and subordinated debentures: The fair value of the Company’s borrowings and subordinated debentures is estimated using a discounted cash flow\ncalculation that applies discount rates currently offered based on similar maturities. The Company also considers its own creditworthiness in determining the\nfair value of its borrowings and subordinated debt. Contractual cash flows for the subordinated debt are reduced based on the estimated rates of default, the\nseverity of losses to be incurred on a default, and the rates at which the subordinated debt is expected to prepay after the call date.\nServicing asset (liability): Servicing assets and liabilities do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. The Company estimates the fair\nvalue of servicing assets and liabilities using discounted cash flow models, incorporating numerous assumptions from the perspective of a market participant,\nincluding market discount rates.\nOff-balance-sheet instruments: Loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate are insignificant at September 30,\n2024 and December 31, 2023.\n12. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company is required to account for certain assets at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis. The Company determines fair value in accordance with\nGAAP, which defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market\nparticipants on the measurement date. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\nuse of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement\ndate.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets\nthat are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in\npricing an asset or liability.\nValuation techniques based on unobservable inputs are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of\nfuture cash flows and the selection of discount rates that may appropriately reflect market and credit risks. Changes in these judgments often have a material impact\non the fair value estimates. In addition, since these estimates are as of a specific point in time they are susceptible to material near-term changes.\n45\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nThe following table details the financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates the fair\nvalue hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine the fair value. The Company had no transfers into or out of Levels 1, 2 or 3\nduring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nFair Value\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nMarketable equity securities $ 2,148 $ — $ —\nAvailable for sale investment securities:\nU.S. Government and agency obligations 63,682 29,717 —\nCorporate bonds — 15,467 —\nDerivative asset — 5,115 —\nDerivative liability — 4,293 —\nDecember 31, 2023:\nMarketable equity securities $ 2,070 $ — $ —\nAvailable for sale investment securities:\nU.S. Government and agency obligations 62,514 32,712 —\nCorporate bonds — 14,510 —\nDerivative asset — 8,819 —\nDerivative liability — 4,496 —\nMarketable equity securities and available for sale investment securities: The fair value of the Company’s investment securities is estimated by using pricing\nmodels or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics (i.e., matrix pricing) and is classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. The\npricing is primarily sourced from third-party pricing services overseen by management.\nDerivative assets and liabilities: The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities consist of transactions as part of management’s strategy to manage interest rate\nrisk. The valuation of the Company’s interest rate swaps is obtained from a third-party pricing service and is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis on\nthe expected cash flows of each derivative. The pricing analysis is based on observable inputs for the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to\nmaturity and interest rate curves. The Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate derivatives fall within Level 2 of the\nfair value hierarchy.\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These include assets that are measured at the lower-of-\ncost-or-market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period as well as assets that are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are\nsubject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment.\n46\nThe following table details the financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and indicates\nthe fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine the fair value:\nFair Value\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nIndividually evaluated loans $ — $ — $ 95,008\nServicing asset, net — — 594\nDecember 31, 2023:\nIndividually evaluated loans $ — $ — $ 104,050\nServicing asset, net — — 865\nThe following table presents information about quantitative inputs and assumptions for Level 3 financial instruments carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at\nSeptember 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:\nFair Value Valuation Methodology Unobservable Input Range\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2024:\nIndividually evaluated loans $ 57,794 Appraisals Discount to appraised value 0.04% - 8.00%\nAppraisals, cash surrender value\nlife insurance, securities, cash held Discounts to appraised value\n26,697 as collateral and securities value 0.00% - 8.00%\n10,517 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 3.38 - 10.25%\n$ 95,008\nServicing asset, net $ 594 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 10.00%\nPrepayment rate 3.00 - 17.00%\nDecember 31, 2023:\nIndividually evaluated loans $ 31,527 Appraisals Discount to appraised value 8.00%\nAppraisals, cash surrender value\nlife insurance, securities, cash held Discounts to appraised value\n22,129 as collateral and securities value 0.00% - 8.00%\n50,394 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 3.38 - 10.75%\n$ 104,050\nServicing asset, net $ 865 Discounted cash flows Discount rate 10.00%\nPrepayment rate 3.00 - 17.00%\nIndividually evaluated loans: Loans are generally not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Periodically, the Company records nonrecurring adjustments to the\ncarrying value of loans based on fair value measurements for partial charge-offs of the uncollectible portions of those loans. Nonrecurring adjustments also include\ncertain impairment amounts for collateral-dependent loans calculated in accordance with ASC 310-10 when establishing the ACL-Loans. Such amounts are\ngenerally based on the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the loan. Collateral is typically valued using appraisals or other\n47\nindications of value based on recent comparable sales of similar properties or other assumptions. Estimates of fair value based on collateral are generally based on\nassumptions not observable in the marketplace and therefore such valuations have been classified as Level 3. For those loans where the primary source of\nrepayment is cash flow from operations, adjustments include impairment amounts calculated based on the perceived collectability of interest payments on the basis\nof a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing a discount rate equivalent to the original note rate.\nServicing assets and liabilities: When loans are sold, on a servicing retained basis, servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value. All classes of servicing assets\nare subsequently measured using the amortization method which requires servicing rights to be amortized. The fair value of servicing assets and liabilities are not\nmeasured on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments when and if the assets or liabilities are deemed to be impaired.\n13. Subordinated debentures\nOn October 14, 2021, the Company completed a private placement of a $35.0 million fixed-to-floating rate subordinated note (the “2021 Note”) to an institutional\naccredited investor. The Company used the net proceeds to repay the $15.5 million principal balance of subordinated notes issued in 2015.\nThe 2021 Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.25% per year until October 14, 2026. Thereafter, the interest rate will reset quarterly at a variable rate equal to the\nthen current three-month term SOFR plus 233 basis points. The 2021 Note has a stated maturity of October 15, 2031 and is non-callable for five years. Beginning\nOctober 15, 2026, the Company may redeem the 2021 Note, in whole or in part, at its option. The 2021 Note is not redeemable at the option of the holder. The\n2021 Note has been structured to qualify for the Company as Tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines.\nOn August 19, 2022, the Company entered into a Subordinated Note Purchase Agreement with certain qualified institutional buyers, pursuant to which the\nCompany issued and sold 6.0% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2032 (the “2022 Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $35.0 million. The\nCompany used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2022 Notes for general corporate purposes.\nThe 2022 Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% per year until August 31, 2027. Thereafter, the interest rate will reset quarterly at a variable rate equal to the\nthen current three-month term SOFR plus 326 basis points. The 2022 Notes have a stated maturity of September 1, 2032 and are non-callable for five years.\nBeginning August 19, 2027, the Company may redeem the 2022 Notes, in whole or in part, at its option. The 2022 Notes are not subject to redemption at the option\nof the holder. The 2022 Notes have been structured to qualify for the Company as Tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines.\nThe Company incurred certain costs associated with the issuance of its subordinated debt. The Company capitalized these costs and they have been presented\nwithin subordinated debentures on the consolidated balance sheets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unamortized debt issuance costs were\n$0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Debt issuance costs amortize over the expected life of the related debt. For the three months ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023 the amortization expense for debt issuance costs were $62 thousand and $62 thousand, respectively, and were recognized as an increase to interest\nexpense on borrowings within the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amortization expense for debt\nissuance costs were $185 thousand and $185 thousand, respectively.\nThe Company recognized $0.8 million and $0.8 million in interest expense related to its subordinated debt for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. The Company recognized $2.4 million and $2.4 million in interest expense related to its subordinated debt for the nine-month periods\nended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n48\n14. Subsequent Events\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a $0.20 per share cash dividend, payable on November 22, 2024 to shareholders of record on\nNovember 11, 2024.\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company announced that on October 23, 2024, its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan. Under the terms of the share\nrepurchase plan, the Company is authorized to buy back up to 250,000 shares of its outstanding common stock.\nThe Company intends to accomplish the share repurchases through open market transactions, though the Company could accomplish repurchases through other\nmeans, such as privately negotiated transactions. The timing, price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws (such as\n10b-18 and 10b5-1 rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and other factors. The share repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any\nparticular amount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The Company expects to fund any repurchases\nfrom cash on hand.\nIn connection with the authorization of the new plan, the Company terminated the existing plan (the \"Prior Plan\"), which was originally approved on December 19,\n2018 and authorized the repurchase of 400,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. On October 27, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors voted to increase\nthe number of shares authorized for repurchase under the Prior Plan by 200,000 shares (for a total of 600,000 shares of the Company's common stock). To date, the\nCompany has purchased 535,802 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Prior Plan.\nA $27.1 million multifamily commercial real estate loan was placed on non-performing status as of September 30, 2024. As of November 6, 2024, the Company\nhas a signed agreement for the sale of this loan at par value. As of September 30, 2024, this loan comprises 1.03% of the 2.50% nonperforming loans as a\npercentage of total loans.\n49\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis section presents management’s perspective on our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in\nconjunction with the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report on Form 10-Q. To the extent that this\ndiscussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of future financial outcomes. In addition to\nhistorical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ\nmaterially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the Company’s Form 10-K filed for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023 in the sections titled “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” We assume no obligation to update any\nof these forward-looking statements.\nGeneral\nBankwell Financial Group, Inc. is a bank holding company headquartered in New Canaan, Connecticut. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Bankwell Bank, or\nthe Bank, we serve small and medium-sized businesses and retail clients. We have a history of building long-term client relationships and attracting new clients\nthrough what we believe is out superior service and our ability to deliver a diverse product offering.\nThe following discussion and analysis presents our results of operations and financial condition on a consolidated basis. However, because we conduct all of our\nmaterial business operations through the Bank, the discussion and analysis relates to activities primarily conducted at the Bank.\nWe generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments and fee-based revenues. Our primary source of funding for our loans is deposits. Our\nlargest expenses are interest on deposits and salaries and related employee benefits. We measure our performance primarily through our net interest margin,\nefficiency ratio, ratio of ACL-Loans to total loans, return on average assets and return on average equity, among other metrics, while maintaining appropriate\nregulatory leverage and risk-based capital ratios.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are focused on being the banking provider of choice and to serve as an alternative to our larger competitors. We aim to do this through:\n• Responsive, client-centric products and services;\n• Organic growth and strategic acquisitions when market opportunities present themselves;\n• Utilization of efficient and scalable infrastructure; and\n• Disciplined focus on risk management.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results could differ from our current estimates, as a result of changing conditions and future\nevents. We believe that accounting estimates related to the measurement of the ACL-Loans, the valuation of derivative instruments, investment securities and\ndeferred income taxes, and the evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment are particularly critical and susceptible to significant near-\nterm change.\n50\nEarnings and Performance Overview\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $20.7 million, a decrease of $2.0 million or 8.7% when compared to the same period in\n2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income was $63.1 million, a decrease of $9.1 million or 12.7% when compared to the same\nperiod in 2023. The decrease in net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an increase in interest\nexpense partially offset by an increase in interest on loans due to higher overall loan yields.\nNet income available to common shareholders was $1.9 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, and $9.8 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net income available to common shareholders was $6.8 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, and $28.1 million, or $3.58\nper diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in net income for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in interest expense. This decrease was partially offset by an\nincrease in interest on loans due to higher overall loan yields.\nReturns on average shareholders' equity and average assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.83% and 0.24%, respectively, compared to\n15.19% and 1.19%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Returns on average shareholders' equity and average assets for the nine months\nended September 30, 2024 were 3.35% and 0.29%, respectively, compared to 15.16% and 1.16%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans, securities, and cash less interest paid on deposits and other borrowings, and is the primary\nsource of our operating income. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of\ninterest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Included in interest income are certain loan fees, such as deferred origination fees and late charges. We\nconvert tax-exempt income to a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis using the statutory federal income tax rate adjusted for applicable state income taxes net of\nthe related federal tax benefit. The average balances are principally daily averages. Interest income on loans includes the effect of deferred loan fees and costs\naccounted for as yield adjustments. Premium amortization and discount accretion are included in the respective interest income and interest expense amounts.\nFTE net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $20.8 million and $22.7 million, respectively. FTE net interest income for\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was $63.3 million and $72.4 million, respectively.\nFTE interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained flat at $48.3 million, compared to FTE interest income for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. FTE interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $5.2 million, or 3.7%, to $144.4 million, compared to FTE\ninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to an increase in interest and fees on loans due to higher overall loan yields.\nInterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $1.9 million compared to interest expense for the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by $14.2 million compared to interest expense for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in rates on interest\nbearing deposits.\n51\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential\nThe following tables present the average balances and yields earned on interest earning assets and average balances and weighted average rates paid on our funding\nliabilities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.\nFor the Quarter Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Yield/ Average Yield/\nBalance Interest Rate (4) Balance Interest Rate (4)\nAssets:\nCash and Fed funds sold $ 253,664 $ 3,205 5.03 % $ 265,115 $ 3,393 5.08 %\nSecurities(1) 147,431 1,390 3.78 127,229 953 3.00\nLoans:\nCommercial real estate 1,905,506 28,288 5.81 1,943,725 28,140 5.67\nResidential real estate 47,481 736 6.20 53,966 671 4.97\nConstruction 156,273 3,070 7.69 209,154 3,908 7.31\nCommercial business 512,507 10,783 8.23 539,185 10,394 7.54\nConsumer 41,845 719 6.84 44,020 741 6.66\nTotal loans 2,663,612 43,596 6.40 2,790,050 43,854 6.15\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 5,655 122 8.32 5,696 115 8.13\nTotal earning assets 3,070,362 $ 48,313 6.16 % 3,188,090 $ 48,315 5.93 %\nOther assets 90,410 78,089\nTotal assets $ 3,160,772 $ 3,266,179\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nInterest bearing liabilities:\nNOW $ 94,958 $ 44 0.18 % $ 102,149 $ 47 0.18 %\nMoney market 832,430 8,597 4.11 922,036 9,064 3.90\nSavings 89,463 692 3.07 105,366 817 3.08\nTime 1,347,857 16,246 4.79 1,322,074 13,861 4.16\nTotal interest bearing deposits 2,364,708 25,579 4.30 2,451,625 23,789 3.85\nBorrowed Money 159,349 1,895 4.73 159,103 1,783 4.39\nTotal interest bearing liabilities 2,524,057 $ 27,474 4.33 % 2,610,728 $ 25,572 3.89 %\nNoninterest bearing deposits 303,213 345,988\nOther liabilities 62,602 54,136\nTotal liabilities 2,889,872 3,010,852\nShareholders' equity 270,900 255,327\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 3,160,772 $ 3,266,179\nNet interest income(2) $ 20,839 $ 22,743\nInterest rate spread 1.83 % 2.04 %\nNet interest margin(3) 2.72 % 2.85 %\n(1) Average balances and yields for securities are based on amortized cost.\n(2) The adjustment for securities and loans taxable equivalency amounted to $122 thousand and $52 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively.\n(3) Annualized net interest income as a percentage of earning assets.\n(4) Yields are calculated using the contractual day count convention for each respective product type.\n52\nFor the Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Yield/ Average Yield/\nBalance Interest Rate (4) Balance Interest Rate (4)\nAssets:\nCash and Fed funds sold $ 273,138 $ 10,460 5.12 % $ 281,033 $ 9,983 4.75 %\nSecurities(1) 139,871 3,592 3.42 128,554 2,864 2.97\nLoans:\nCommercial real estate 1,909,390 84,582 5.82 1,932,549 79,958 5.46\nResidential real estate 48,912 2,226 6.07 56,798 1,957 4.59\nConstruction 158,884 8,913 7.37 194,396 10,582 7.18\nCommercial business 517,880 32,097 8.14 546,329 32,073 7.74\nConsumer 41,383 2,163 6.98 30,571 1,489 6.51\nTotal loans 2,676,449 129,981 6.38 2,760,643 126,059 6.02\nFederal Home Loan Bank stock 5,670 357 8.43 5,527 308 7.46\nTotal earning assets 3,095,128 $ 144,390 6.13 % 3,175,757 $ 139,214 5.78 %\nOther assets 92,249 66,342\nTotal assets $ 3,187,377 $ 3,242,099\nLiabilities and shareholders' equity:\nInterest bearing liabilities:\nNOW $ 97,970 $ 133 0.18 % $ 97,741 $ 127 0.17 %\nMoney market 849,860 26,294 4.13 910,840 23,532 3.45\nSavings 91,135 2,093 3.07 117,984 2,404 2.72\nTime 1,319,031 47,098 4.77 1,291,124 35,536 3.68\nTotal interest bearing deposits 2,357,996 75,618 4.28 2,417,689 61,599 3.41\nBorrowed Money 159,288 5,450 4.57 161,166 5,238 4.29\nTotal interest bearing liabilities 2,517,284 $ 81,068 4.30 % 2,578,855 $ 66,837 3.47 %\nNoninterest bearing deposits 336,129 374,943\nOther liabilities 62,631 40,192\nTotal liabilities 2,916,044 2,993,990\nShareholders' equity 271,333 248,109\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 3,187,377 $ 3,242,099\nNet interest income(2) $ 63,322 $ 72,377\nInterest rate spread 1.83 % 2.31 %\nNet interest margin(3) 2.73 % 3.04 %\n(1) Average balances and yields for securities are based on amortized cost.\n(2) The adjustment for securities and loans taxable equivalency amounted to $239 thousand and $154 thousand for the\nnine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(3) Annualized net interest income as a percentage of earning assets.\n(4) Yields are calculated using the contractual day count convention for each respective product type.\n53\nEffect of changes in interest rates and volume of average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities\nThe following table shows the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of average earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities\nhave affected net interest income.

The provision\n(credit) for credit losses is charged against earnings in order to maintain our ACL-Loans and ACL-Unfunded Commitments and reflects management’s best\nestimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date.\nThe provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.3 million compared to a credit for credit losses of $1.6 million for the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $18.2 million compared to a provision for\ncredit losses of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the provision for credit losses for the quarter was primarily due to a\ncharge-off of $8.2 million. The increase was partially offset by a $1.0 million recovery on a previously charged-off loan.\n54\nThe increase in provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven due to charge-offs of $20.1 million partially offset\nby recoveries of $1.3 million.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income is a component of our revenue and is comprised primarily of fees generated from deposit relationships with our clients, fees generated from\nsales and referrals of loans, and income earned on bank-owned life insurance.\nThe following tables compare noninterest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nGains and fees from sales of loans $ 133 $ 237 $ (104) (43.9)\nBank-owned life insurance 346 303 43 14.2\nService charges and fees 575 294 281 95.6\nOther 102 (48) 150 Favorable\nTotal noninterest income $ 1,156 $ 786 $ 370 47.1 %\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nGains and fees from sales of loans $ 499 $ 1,893 $ (1,394) (73.6)%\nBank-owned life insurance 1,008 876 132 15.1\nService charges and fees 1,374 941 433 46.0\nOther (127) 3 (130) Unfavorable\nTotal noninterest income $ 2,754 $ 3,713 $ (959) (25.8)%\nNoninterest income increased by $0.4 million to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Noninterest income decreased by $1.0 million to $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September\n30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income was driven by an increase in service charges and fees for the three months ended 2024. The decrease in noninterest\nincome was driven by a decrease in SBA loan sales partially offset by an increase in service charges and fees for the nine months ended 2024.\n55\nNoninterest Expense\nThe following tables compare noninterest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 6,223 $ 6,036 $ 187 3.1 %\nOccupancy and equipment 2,334 2,146 188 8.8\nProfessional services 1,142 491 651 132.6\nData processing 851 741 110 14.8\nDirector fees 292 362 (70) (19.3)\nFDIC insurance 853 1,026 (173) (16.9)\nMarketing 73 184 (111) (60.3)\nOther 1,097 1,219 (122) (10.0)\nTotal noninterest expense $ 12,865 $ 12,205 $ 660 5.4 %\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, Change\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 $ %\nSalaries and employee benefits $ 18,690 $ 18,507 $ 183 1.0 %\nOccupancy and equipment 6,894 6,434 460 7.1\nProfessional services 3,196 2,505 691 27.6\nData processing 2,346 2,141 205 9.6\nDirector fees 1,498 1,207 291 24.1\nFDIC insurance 2,488 3,138 (650) (20.7)\nMarketing 277 512 (235) (45.9)\nOther 3,018 3,093 (75) (2.4)\nTotal noninterest expense $ 38,407 $ 37,537 $ 870 2.3 %\nNoninterest expense increased by $0.7 million to $12.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,\n2023. Noninterest expense increased by $0.9 million to $38.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily driven by an increase in professional services for the three and nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled $0.8 million and $3.1 million, respectively.

The increase was partially offset by dividends paid of $4.7 million.\nLoan Portfolio\nWe originate commercial real estate loans, construction loans, commercial business loans and consumer loans in our market. We also pursue certain types of\ncommercial lending opportunities outside our market, particularly where we have strong business relationships. Our loan portfolio is the largest category of our\nearning assets.\nTotal loans before deferred loan fees and the ACL-Loans were $2.6 billion at September 30, 2024 and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2023.

Our Board of Directors monitors credit risk management. The\nDirectors Loan Committee (\"DLC\") has primary oversight responsibility for the credit-granting function including approval authority for credit-granting policies,\nreview of management’s credit-granting activities and approval of large exposure credit requests, as well as loan review and problem loan management and\nresolution. The committee reports the results of its respective oversight functions to our Board of Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors receives\ninformation concerning asset quality measurements and trends on a monthly basis. While we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards, our loan\nportfolio is not immune to potential negative consequences as a result of general economic weakness, such as a prolonged downturn in the housing market or\ncommercial real estate market on a national scale. Decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for loans. In\naddition, adverse changes in the economy could have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make scheduled loan payments, which would likely have an\nadverse impact on earnings.\nThe Company has established credit policies applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness of each\nclient and extends credit of up to 80% of the market value of the collateral, (85% maximum for owner occupied commercial real estate), depending on the client's\ncreditworthiness and the type of collateral. The client’s ability to service the debt is monitored on an ongoing basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral.\nOther important forms of collateral are business assets, time deposits and marketable securities. While collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of\nrepayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment for commercial loans to be based on the client’s ability to generate continuing cash\nflows. The Company does not provide first or second consumer mortgage loans secured by residential properties but has a small legacy portfolio which continues\nto amortize, pay off due to the sale of the collateral, or refinance away from the Company.\nCredit risk management involves a partnership between our relationship managers and our credit approval, portfolio management, credit administration and\ncollections departments. Disciplined underwriting, portfolio monitoring and early problem recognition are important aspects of maintaining our high credit quality\nstandards and low levels of nonperforming assets since our inception in 2002.\nNonperforming assets. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and property acquired through foreclosures or repossession. The following table presents\nnonperforming assets and additional asset quality data for the dates indicated:\n(In thousands) At September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023\nNonaccrual loans:\nReal estate loans:\nResidential $ 1,316 $ 1,386\nCommercial 46,360 23,009\nCommercial business 9,101 15,430\nConstruction 8,766 9,382\nConsumer — —\nTotal nonaccrual loans 65,543 49,207\nOther real estate owned — —\nTotal nonperforming assets $ 65,543 $ 49,207\nNonperforming assets to total assets 2.07 % 1.53 %\nNonaccrual loans to total gross loans 2.50 % 1.81 %\nACL-loans as a % of total loans 1.06 % 1.03 %\nACL-loans as a % of nonperforming loans 42.34 % 56.79 %\nTotal past due loans to total gross loans 2.48 % 0.78 %\nNonperforming assets totaled $65.5 million and represented 2.07% of total assets at September 30, 2024, compared to $49.2 million and 1.53% of total assets at\nDecember 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans totaled $65.5 million at September 30, 2024 and $49.2 million at December 31, 2023. Nonaccrual loans were $56.2 million\nas of June 30, 2024. The increase in nonaccrual loans compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily due to a $27.1 million1 commercial real estate multi-family loan\nthat was placed on nonaccrual in the third quarter of 2024. The increase was partially offset by two loans that were partially charged-off for a total of $15.4 million\nand two loans that were paid off totaling $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2024.\n59\n1. As of November 6, 2024, the Company has a signed agreement for the sale of this loan at par value. As of September 30, 2024, this loan comprises 1.03% of the 2.50% nonperforming loans as a\npercentage of total loans.\nThere was no Other Real Estate Owned (\"OREO\") at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nACL-Loans\nWe evaluate the adequacy of the ACL-Loans based on \"forward looking\" expected losses. Management believes that the current ACL-Loans will be adequate to\nabsorb credit losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible based on the evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. The evaluation takes\ninto consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality and specific problem loans, and current economic\nconditions which may affect the borrowers’ ability to pay. The evaluation also details historical losses by loan segment and the resulting credit loss rates which are\nprojected for current loan total amounts. Loss estimates for specified problem loans are also detailed. All of the factors considered in the analysis of the adequacy\nof the ACL-Loans may be subject to change.\nWe estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of our ACL-Loans is\nbased on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, the Bank’s and peer banks’ historical loss experience, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall\nportfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain\nhistorical loan loss rates.\nOur general practice is to identify problem credits early and recognize full or partial charge-offs as promptly as practicable when it is determined that it is probable\nthat the loan will not be repaid according to its original contractual terms, including principal and interest. Full or partial charge-offs on collateral dependent\nindividually evaluated loans are recognized when the collateral is deemed to be insufficient to support the carrying value of the loan. We do not recognize a\nrecovery when an updated appraisal indicates a subsequent increase in value of the collateral.\nOur charge-off policies, which comply with standards established by our banking regulators, are consistently applied from period to period. Charge-offs are\nrecorded on a monthly basis, as incurred. Partially charged-off loans continue to be evaluated on a monthly basis and additional charge-offs may be recorded on the\nremaining loan balance based on the same criteria.\n60\nThe following table presents the activity in our ACL-Loans and related ratios for the dates indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nBalance at beginning of period $ 36,083 $ 30,694 $ 27,946 $ 22,431\nCECL Day 1 Adjustment — — — 5,079\nBalance at beginning of period-Adjusted 36,083 30,694 27,946 27,510\nCharge-offs:\nResidential real estate — — (141) —\nCommercial real estate (8,184) — (12,012) —\nCommercial business (7,010) — (7,207) (439)\nConsumer (17) (32) (78) (69)\nConstruction (616) — (616) —\nTotal charge-offs (15,827) (32) (20,054) (508)\nRecoveries:\nResidential real estate — — 141 —\nCommercial real estate 1,013 — 1,126 —\nCommercial business (34) 35 (7) 68\nConsumer 1 20 18 35\nConstruction — — — —\nTotal recoveries 980 55 1,278 103\nNet (charge-offs) recoveries (14,847) 23 (18,776) (405)\nProvision (credit) for credit losses - loans 6,516 (1,433) 18,582 2,179\nBalance at end of period $ 27,752 $ 29,284 $ 27,752 $ 29,284\nNet charge-offs to average loans 0.56 % — % 0.70 % 0.01 %\nACL-Loans to total gross loans 1.06 % 1.06 % 1.06 % 1.06 %\nAt September 30, 2024, our ACL-Loans was $27.8 million and represented 1.06% of total gross loans, compared to $27.9 million, or 1.03% of total gross loans, at\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the ACL-Loans balance and the related allocation percentage of these loans across the total loan portfolio:\nAt September 30, 2024 At December 31, 2023\nLoan Segment to Loan Segment to\nACL-Loans ACL-Loan Total Loans ACL-Loan Total Loans\n(Dollars in thousands) Amount Percentage Percentage ACL-Loans Percentage Percentage\nResidential real estate $ 102 0.38 % 1.74 % $ 149 0.53 % 1.87 %\nCommercial real estate 21,978 79.19 71.97 20,950 74.97 71.64\nConstruction 1,605 5.78 6.11 1,699 6.08 6.75\nCommercial business 3,520 12.68 18.69 4,562 16.32 18.41\nConsumer 547 1.97 1.49 586 2.10 1.33\nTotal ACL-Loans $ 27,752 100.00 % 100.00 % $ 27,946 100.00 % 100.00 %\nThe allocation of the ACL-Loans at September 30, 2024 reflects our assessment of credit risk and probable loss within each portfolio.

Our primary source of\nliquidity is deposits. While our generally preferred funding strategy is to attract and retain low cost deposits, our ability to do so is affected by competitive interest\nrates and terms in the marketplace. Other sources of funding include discretionary use of purchased liabilities (e.g., FHLB term advances and other borrowings),\ncash flows from our investment securities portfolios, loan sales, loan repayments and earnings. Investment securities designated as available for sale may also be\nsold in response to short-term or long-term liquidity needs.\nThe Bank’s liquidity positions are monitored daily by management. The Asset Liability Committee (\"ALCO\") establishes guidelines to ensure maintenance of\nprudent levels of liquidity. ALCO reports to the Company’s Board of Directors.\nThe Bank has a detailed liquidity funding policy and a contingency funding plan that provide for the prompt and comprehensive response to unexpected demands\nfor liquidity. We employ a stress testing methodology to estimate needs for contingent funding that could result from unexpected outflows of funds in excess of\n“business as usual” cash flows. The Bank has established unsecured borrowing capacity with Zions Bank, PCBB, and ACBB. The Bank also maintains additional\ncollateralized borrowing capacity with the FRB and the FHLB in excess of levels used in the ordinary course of business. Our sources of liquidity include cash,\nunpledged investment securities, borrowings from the FRB, FHLB, lines of credit from Zions Bank, PCBB, and ACBB, the brokered deposit market and national\nCD listing services.\nCapital Resources\nShareholders’ equity totaled $267.9 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of $2.2 million compared to December 31, 2023, primarily a result of net income\nof $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was partially offset by dividends paid of $4.7 million.\nThe Bank and Company are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital\nrequirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the\nCompany’s financial statements. At September 30, 2024, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject and exceeded the regulatory\nminimum capital levels to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. At September 30, 2024, the Bank’s ratio of\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 11.80%, total capital to risk-weighted assets was 12.83%, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was\n11.80% and Tier 1 capital to average assets was 10.24%. At September 30, 2024, the Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which it was subject and\nexceeded the regulatory minimum capital levels to be considered well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. At September 30,\n2024,\n63\nthe Company’s ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets was 9.70%, total capital to risk-weighted assets was 13.26%, Tier 1 capital to risk-\nweighted assets was 9.70% and Tier 1 capital to average assets was 8.44%.\nUnder the current guidelines, banking organizations must have a minimum total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%,\na minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% in order to be \"adequately capitalized.\" In addition to\nthese requirements, banking organizations must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of common Tier 1 equity in an amount above the minimum risk-\nbased capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets, resulting in a requirement for the Company and the\nBank to effectively maintain common equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 7.0%, 8.5% and 10.5%, respectively. The Company and the Bank must\nmaintain the capital conservation buffer to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, or to engage in share repurchases.\nAsset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk\nWe measure interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate earnings and equity at risk. These risk measures are quantified using simulation software from\none of the leading firms in the field of asset/liability modeling. Key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads, prepayment speeds and the run-\noff of deposits. From such simulations, interest rate risk, or IRR, is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented. We model IRR by using\ntwo primary risk measurement techniques: simulation of net interest income and simulation of economic value of equity. These two measurements are\ncomplementary and provide both short-term and long-term risk profiles for the Company. Because both baseline simulations assume that our balance sheet will\nremain static over the simulation horizon, the results do not reflect adjustments in strategy that ALCO could implement in response to rate shifts. The simulation\nanalyses are updated quarterly.\nWe use a net interest income at risk simulation to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market rates. This simulation captures underlying\nproduct behaviors, such as asset and liability repricing dates, balloon dates, interest rate indices and spreads, rate caps and floors, as well as other behavioral\nattributes. The simulation of net interest income also requires a number of key assumptions such as: (i) prepayment projections for loans and securities that are\nprojected under each interest rate scenario using internal and external mortgage analytics; (ii) new business loan rates that are based on recent new business\norigination experience; and (iii) deposit pricing assumptions for non-maturity deposits reflecting the Bank’s history, management judgment and core deposit\nstudies. Combined, these assumptions can be inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results may differ from simulation forecasts due to the timing, magnitude\nand frequency of interest rate changes, future business conditions, as well as unanticipated changes in management strategies.\nWe use two sets of standard scenarios to measure net interest income at risk. For the Parallel Ramp Scenarios, rate changes are ramped over a twelve-month\nhorizon based upon a parallel yield curve shift and then maintained at those levels over the remainder of the simulation horizon. Parallel Shock Scenarios assume\ninstantaneous parallel movements in the yield curve compared to a flat yield curve scenario. Simulation analysis involves projecting a future balance sheet structure\nand interest income and expense under the various rate scenarios. Internal policy regarding internal rate risk simulations currently specifies that for instantaneous\nparallel shifts of the yield curve, estimated net interest income at risk for the subsequent one-year period should not decline by more than: 6% for a 100 basis point\nshift; 12% for a 200 basis point shift; and 18% for a 300 basis point shift. Per Company policy, the Bank should not be outside these limits for twelve consecutive\nmonths unless the Bank's forecasted capital ratios are considered to be \"well capitalized\". As of September 30, 2024, the Bank has met all minimum regulatory\ncapital requirements to be considered \"well capitalized\".\n64\nThe following tables set forth the estimated percentage change in our net interest income at risk over one-year simulation periods beginning September 30, 2024\nand December 31, 2023:\nParallel Ramp\nEstimated Percent Change in Net Interest Income\nRate Changes (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n-100 1.00 % 1.70 %\n+200 (2.20) (3.20)\nParallel Shock\nEstimated Percent Change in Net Interest Income\nRate Changes (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n-100 0.50 % 3.60 %\n+100 (1.00) (2.70)\n+200 (2.10) (5.80)\n+300 (2.70) (8.10)\nThe net interest income at risk simulation results indicate that, as of September 30, 2024, we remain liability sensitive. The liability sensitivity is due to the fact that\nthere are more liabilities than assets subject to repricing as market rates change.\nWe conduct an economic value of equity at risk simulation in tandem with net interest income simulations, to ascertain a longer term view of our interest rate risk\nposition by capturing longer-term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet. It measures the sensitivity of economic value of equity to changes\nin interest rates. The economic value of equity at risk simulation values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions used in one\nof the income simulations. As with the net interest income simulation, this simulation captures product characteristics such as loan resets, repricing terms, maturity\ndates, rate caps and floors. Key assumptions include loan prepayment speeds, deposit pricing elasticity and non-maturity deposit attrition rates. These assumptions\ncan have significant impacts on valuation results as the assumptions remain in effect for the entire life of each asset and liability. All key assumptions are subject to\na periodic review.\nBase case economic value of equity at risk is calculated by estimating the net present value of all future cash flows from existing assets and liabilities using current\ninterest rates. The base case scenario assumes that future interest rates remain unchanged.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated percentage change in our economic value of equity at risk, assuming various shifts in interest rates:\nEstimated Percent Change in Economic Value of Equity\n(\"EVE\")\nRate Changes (basis points) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n-100 2.50 % 2.70 %\n+100 (3.30) (3.80)\n+200 (7.80) (9.40)\n+300 (10.80) (12.60)\nWhile ALCO reviews and updates simulation assumptions and also periodically back-tests the simulation results to ensure that the assumptions are reasonable and\ncurrent, income simulation may not always prove to be an accurate indicator of interest rate risk or future net interest margin. Over time, the repricing, maturity and\nprepayment characteristics of financial instruments and the composition of our balance sheet may change to a different degree than estimated. ALCO recognizes\nthat deposit balances could shift into higher yielding alternatives as market rates change. ALCO has modeled increased costs of deposits in the rising rate\nsimulation scenarios presented above.\n65\nIt should be noted that the static balance sheet assumption does not necessarily reflect our expectation for future balance sheet growth, which is a function of the\nbusiness environment and client behavior. Another significant simulation assumption is the sensitivity of core deposits to fluctuations in interest rates. Income\nsimulation results assume that changes in both core savings deposit rates and balances are related to changes in short-term interest rates. Lastly, mortgage-backed\nsecurities and mortgage loans involve a level of risk that unforeseen changes in prepayment speeds may cause related cash flows to vary significantly in differing\nrate environments. Such changes could affect the level of reinvestment risk associated with cash flow from these instruments, as well as their market value.\nChanges in prepayment speeds could also increase or decrease the amortization of premium or accretion of discounts related to such instruments, thereby affecting\ninterest income.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nInterest rate risk management is our primary market risk. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations –\nAsset/Liability Management and Interest Rate Risk” herein for a discussion of our management of our interest rate risk.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur financial statements and related data contained in this quarterly report have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measure of financial\nposition and operating results in terms of historic dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nInflation generally increases the costs of funds and operating overhead, and to the extent loans and other assets bear variable rates, the yields on such assets. Unlike\nthe assets and liabilities of most industrial companies, virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest\nrates generally have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than the effects of general levels of inflation. In addition, inflation affects\na financial institution’s cost of goods and services purchased, the cost of salaries and benefits, occupancy expense and similar items. Inflation and related increases\nin interest rates generally decrease the market value of investments and loans held and may adversely affect liquidity, earnings and shareholders’ equity.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures:\nThe Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive\nOfficer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act\nRule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period reported on in this\nreport, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its\nconsolidated subsidiary) required to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC filings.\n(b) Change in internal controls:\nThere has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is\nreasonably likely to affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nPART II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nThe Company and the Bank are periodically involved in various legal proceedings as normal incident to their businesses. In the opinion of management, no\nmaterial loss is expected from any such pending lawsuit.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nThere were no material changes in risk factors previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed\nwith the SEC.\n66\nItem 2.

On October 27, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 200,000 shares under the Prior Plan. To date,\nthe Company has purchased 535,802 shares of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the Prior Plan.\nOn October 28, 2024, the Company announced that on October 23, 2024, its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan (\"New Plan\"). Under the terms\nof the New Plan, the Company is authorized to purchase up to 250,000 shares of its outstanding common stock. In connection with the authorization of the New\nPlan, the Company terminated the Prior Plan.\nThe Company intends to accomplish the share repurchases through open market transactions, although the Company could accomplish repurchases through other\nmeans, such as privately negotiated transactions. The timing, price and volume of repurchases will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws (such as\n10b-18 and 10b5-1 rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and other factors. The New Plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular\namount of common stock, and it may be modified or suspended at any time at the Company's discretion. The Company expects to fund any repurchases from cash\non hand.\nItem 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities\nNone.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNone.\nItem 5. Other Information\nNone.\n67\nItem 6.
