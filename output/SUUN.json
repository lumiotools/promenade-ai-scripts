The classification of the investment in GIC and investment in Partnership Units was reported in\nfinancing activities instead of investing activities.\n2. The settlement of aged accounts receivable for acquisition of property, plant and equipment and\nrelated items were non-cash related and should be reported in operation activities instead of\ninvesting and financial activities.\n3. Repayment of shareholder loan was reported in operating activities instead of financing activities.\n4. Foreign exchange gain and loss was grouped into effect of changes in exchange rate instead of\noperating activities.\nSee note 27 of the Amended and Restated Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the balances\nand changes.\nThere was no impact to the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, Consolidated Statements of\nIncome and Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders’ equity, and\ncash position of the Company as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023.\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\n(Formerly Abundant Solar Energy Inc.)\nAmended and Restated Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\nMSLL CPA LLP\n2110 - 1177 West Hastings Street Tel: 604 688 5671\nVancouver, B.C. Canada Fax: 604 688 8479\nV6E 2K3 msllcpa.com\nINDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT\nTo the shareholders of SolarBank Corporation:\nReport on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOpinion\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of SolarBank Corporation (the “Company”), which\ncomprise the consolidated statements of financial position as at June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the\nconsolidated statements of income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss), the consolidated statements of\nchanges in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated\nfinancial position of the Company as at June 30, 2023 and 2022, and its consolidated financial performance\nand its consolidated cash flows for the years ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (IFRSs).\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Our\nresponsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of\nthe consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in\naccordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements in Canada, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these\nrequirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide\na basis for our opinion.\nEmphasis of Matter – Amended Financial Statements\nWe draw attention to Note 27 to the financial statements, which describes that the financial statements that\nwe originally reported on October 23, 2023 have been amended and describes the matter that gave rise to\nthe amendment of the financial statements. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. The\nprocedures that we performed on subsequent events are restricted solely to the restatement.\nKey Audit Matter\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our\naudit of the financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2023. These matters were addressed in the\ncontext of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do\nnot provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the\nkey audit matters to be communicated in our auditor’s report.\nSettlement of note receivable through the acquisition of 67% ownership of Solar Alliance Energy DevCo\nLLC\nDescription of the matter\nWe draw attention to Note 7, 16, 20 to the financial statements. On June 20, 2023, the Company settled a\npromissory note of $1,206,004 (USD $891,158) plus accrued interest of $111,821 (USD $82,203) through\nthe acquisition of 67% of in Solar Alliance DevCo LLC (“Solar Alliance DevCo”), The Company has\ndetermined that this transaction is a business combination as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nconstitute a business. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting\nwhereby the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at\nthe ,acquisition date. The total consideration of $574,824 is the fair value of the promissory note and accrued\ninterest as of June 20, 2023. The acquisition date fair value for identifiable net asset was $857,946 and for\nnon-controlling interest was $283,122.\nWhy the matter is a key audit matter\nThe Company’s determination of whether the transaction is accounted for as a business combination instead\nof asset acquisition requires significant management judgment. The fair value of capital assets acquired in\nbusiness combination also involved high degree of estimation uncertainty.\nAdditionally, Solar Alliance DevCo has recognized an amount of $460,607 of tax equity liability relating\nto certain projects in the U.S. under tax equity structures to finance the capital cost of solar facilities on the\nacquisition date.\nTax equity structures allocate the majority of the renewable tax incentives, such as investment tax credits\nand accelerated depreciation for tax purpose, to tax equity investors until they receive an agreed-upon after\ntax-investment return (the “flip point”). Estimates are made when determining the expected future cash\nflows to calculate the effective interest rate and amortization of tax equity liability. Future cash flows\ndepend on certain assumptions such as electricity production, selling prices, cost to operate and tax\namounts.\nAuditing these estimates and market conditions required a high degree of subjectivity in applying audit\nprocedures and in evaluating the results of those procedures. This resulted in an increased extent of audit\neffort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.\nHow the matter was addressed in the audit\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this key audit matter included the following:\n• Obtained and reviewed agreements related to the settlement of promissory note and acquisition of\n67% ownership and assess the appropriateness of management’s accounting treatment to ensure it\nis in alien with IFRS 3;\n• Assessed whether the transaction should be accounted for as business combination or asset\nacquisition by applying a three-element process (inputs, processes and outputs) under IFRS 3;\n• Obtained and reviewed the valuation report prepared by third party valuation expert related to Solar\nAlliance DevCo’s solar energy projects and assessed the appropriateness of the valuation,\nmethodology and the reasonability of the underlying data and assumptions;\n• Performed enquiries and discussion with management’s valuation expert and confirm the expert’s\nqualification and objectivity;\n• Reviewed and assessed overall purchase price allocation calculation for reasonableness;\nFor tax equity liabilities, we evaluated the Company’s estimated total tax equity liabilities by:\n• Obtained an understanding of the tax equity structure and assessed whether the project company\nshould be consolidated based on the Company’s right to variable returns and its ability to influence\nfinancial and operational decisions impacting those returns;\n• Reviewed agreements related to the investment made in U.S. renewable energy projects with the\ntax equity investors and assessed the appropriateness of management’s accounting treatment;\n• Assessed the appropriateness of the Company’s identification and evaluation of the contractual\nterms and conditions in their assessment of the recognition of the investor’s contribution;\n• Evaluated the methodology used by management and noted it was consistent with the contractual\nallocation provisions of the agreements;\n• Evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s expected tax amounts and timing of tax credits\nand other tax attributes in the models by assessing the Company’s estimated outcome of applicable\ntax laws;\nOther Information\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis.\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not\nand will not express an opinion or any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other\ninformation identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially\ninconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise\nappears to be materially misstated.\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other\ninformation, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\nResponsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial\nStatements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements\nin accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable\nthe preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due\nto fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s\nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using\nthe going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to\ncease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a\nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report\nthat includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an\naudit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards, we exercise\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and\nobtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk\nof not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from\nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the\noverride of internal control.\n• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control.\n• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.\n• Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting\nand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events\nor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going\nconcern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our\nauditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such\ndisclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence\nobtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the\nCompany to cease to continue as a going concern.\n• Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements,\nincluding the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the\nunderlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or\nbusiness activities within the Company to express an opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit.\nWe remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope\nand timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal\ncontrol that we identify during our audit.\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant\nethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other\nmatters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related\nsafeguards.\nThe engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor's report is Ying Xu, CPA, CA.\nChartered Professional Accountants\nVancouver, Canada\nOctober 23, 2023, except for the effects of the restatements as discussed in Note 27 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements as to which the date is May 23, 2024.\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position\n(Expressed in Canadian dollars)\nNotes June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 749,427 $ 931,977\nShort-term investment 3(d) 6,550,000 -\nTrade and other receivables 4 3,837,207 2,200,226\nUnbilled revenue 7,405,866 -\nPrepaid expenses and deposits 5 3,054,678 2,060,455\nContract fulfilment costs 8 -

Nature of operations:\nSolarBank Corporation (formerly Abundant Solar Energy Inc.) (the “Company”) was formed under\nthe laws of the province of Ontario on September 23, 2013. The Company is engaged in the\ndevelopment and operation of solar photovoltaic power generation projects in the province of Ontario\nand New York state. The Company changed its name from Abundant Solar Energy Inc. to SolarBank\nCorporation on October 7, 2022.\nThe address of the Company and the principal place of the business is 505 Consumers Rd, Suite\n803, Toronto, ON, M2J 4Z2.\nOn March 1, 2023, the Company closed its initial public offering (the “Offering”) of common shares.\nWith completion of the Offering, the Company commenced trading its common shares on the\nCanadian Securities Exchange (the “CSE”) under the symbol “SUNN” on March 2, 2023.\n2. Basis of presentation\n(a) Statement of compliance:\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board (“IASB”).\nThe board approved these consolidated financial statements of directors for issue on May 23,\n2024.\n(b) Basis of measurement:\nThese consolidated financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis and historical\ncost basis with the exception of certain financial instruments as disclosed in note 3.\n(c) Basis of consolidation:\n(i) Subsidiaries\nThese consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly\nor partially owned subsidiaries.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Company obtains control up to the\ndate of the disposition of control. Control is achieved when the Company has power over\nthe subsidiary, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the\nsubsidiary and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. For non-wholly owned\nsubsidiaries over which the Company has control, the net assets attributable to outside\nequity shareholders are presented as “non-controlling interests” in the equity section of the\nconsolidated statement of financial position. Net income for the period that is attributable to\nthe non-controlling interests is calculated based on the ownership of the non-controlling\ninterest shareholders in the subsidiary. Adjustments to recognize the non-controlling\ninterests’ share of changes to the subsidiary’s equity are made even if this results in the non-\ncontrolling interests having a deficit balance. Changes in the Company’s ownership interest\nin a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are recorded as equity transactions. The\ncarrying amount of non-controlling interests is adjusted to reflect the change in the non-\ncontrolling interests’ relative interests in the subsidiary and the difference between the\nadjustment to the carrying amount of non-controlling interest and the Company’s share of\nproceeds received and/or consideration paid is recognized directly in equity and attributed\nto equity holders of the Company. There are no changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries\nfor the period end June 30, 2023. Details of the Company’s ownership interests in its\nsubsidiaries are as follows:\n7\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n2.

Basis of presentation (continued)\n(i) Functional and presentation currency:\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Canadian dollars. The\nfunctional currency of Canadian parent company and its Canadian subsidiaries is the\nCanadian dollar. The functional currency of its subsidiaries in the United States is the US\ndollar.\n3. Significant accounting policies\n(a) Revenue recognition:\nThe Company recognizes revenue for project development services, engineering, procurement,\nand construction (“EPC”) services and operation and maintenance (“OM”) services.\nThe Company applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will\ncollect the consideration that it is entitled to in exchange for the services transferred to the\ncustomer.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses services promised within each contract that falls\nunder the scope of IFRS 15, to identify distinct performance obligations.\nProject development services\nProject development service contract with customers has a single performance obligation which\nis for the Company to deliver a fully permitted project which is ready for construction. The\nperformance obligation is said to be satisfied at a point in time when development is considered\ncomplete. Therefore, the revenue from development contract is recognized when a solar project\nis fully permitted and ready for construction.\nOM services\nEach OM service contract with customers has a single performance obligation which is for the\nCompany to provide hourly maintenance services as needed for the solar sites. The performance\nobligation is satisfied over a period of time. Therefore, the Company recognizes revenue monthly\nwhich is when service is rendered and based on the hours spent times pre-determined hourly\nrate outlined in the contract.\nEPC services\nEach contract for EPC services has a single performance obligation due to the services included\nin EPC contract are highly interrelated and the contract includes a significant service of\nintegrating the goods and services into the combined item the customer contracts for, that is, to\nbuild the solar sites. The performance obligations are satisfied over a period of time, based on\ncosts incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs for the project.\n(b) Inventory:\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost includes acquisition costs,\ndirect development costs, borrowing costs, property taxes and other overheads incurred for the\ndevelopment of prospective solar projects. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in\nthe ordinary course of the business at the balance sheet date, less costs to complete and\nestimated selling costs.\n9\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(c) Foreign currency translation:\nThe functional currency of the Company is the Canadian Dollar. Functional currencies of the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are the currency of the primary economic environment in which the\nsubsidiary operates.\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the\nappropriate functional currency at foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. Foreign\nexchange differences arising on translation are recognized in the statement of income and loss.\nNon-monetary assets that are measured in a foreign currency at historical cost are translated\nusing the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.\nIn preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of each\nentity are translated into Canadian dollars. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are\ntranslated into Canadian dollars at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.\nRevenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Foreign\nexchange differences are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n(d) Short-term investments\nShort-term investments consist of investments with market values closely approximating book\nvalues and original maturities between three and twelve months at the time of purchase. As at\nJune 30, 2023, the Company has two GICs in short-term investment totalling $6,550,000. The\nGIC of $2,980,000 has one year term and with interest rate of 4.7%. The GIC of $3,570,000 has\none year term and with interest rate of 4.95%.\n(e) Business Combination\nThe Company applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The\nconsideration transferred by the Company to obtain control of a subsidiary is calculated as the\nsum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity\ninterests issued by the Company, which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising\nfrom a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. If the\nCompany acquires a controlling interest in a business in which it previously held an equity\ninterest, that equity interest is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date with any resulting\ngain or loss recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate.\nConsideration transferred as part of a business combination may include the amounts related to\nthe settlement of pre-existing relationships. The gain or loss on the settlement of any pre-existing\nrelationship is recognised in profit or loss.\n(f) Financial instruments:\nThe Company recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability in its consolidated statement of\nfinancial position when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. At initial\nrecognition, the Company measures a financial asset or a financial liability at its fair value plus\nor minus, in the case of a financial asset or a financial liability not at fair value through profit or\nloss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial\nasset or the financial liability.\n10\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(i) Financial assets:\nThe Company will classify financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on its\nbusiness model for managing the financial asset and the financial asset’s contractual cash\nflow characteristics. The three categories are defined as follows:\nA. Financial assets at amortized cost:\nA financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are\nmet:\n• the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order\nto collect contractual cash flows; and\n• the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows\nthat are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount\noutstanding.\nThe Company’s trade and other receivables and short-term investments are measured\nat amortized cost.\nB. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income:\nFinancial assets are classified and measured at fair value through other comprehensive\nloss if they are held in a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting\ncontractual cash flows and selling financial assets. The Company does not have any\nfinancial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive loss.\nC. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss:\nAny financial assets that are not held in one of the two business models mentioned are\nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss. The Company’s cash and long-term\ninvestment in partner units is classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n(ii) Financial liabilities:\nThe Company’s financial liabilities include accounts payable and accruals, advance from\nvendor, loan payable, and long-term debt. The Company classifies its financial liabilities into\none of two categories, depending on the purpose for which the asset was acquired. The\nCompany’s accounting policy for each category is as follows:\nA. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss:\nFinancial liabilities are classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held for\ntrading or are derivative liabilities. The Company does not have any financial liabilities\nclassified as fair value through profit or loss.\nB. Financial liabilities at amortized cost:\nFinancial liabilities classified at amortized cost are those that are not classified as\nfinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Subsequent to initial recognition,\nthey are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The Company’s\ntrade and other payables, loan payable, lease liabilities, convertible debenture, long-\nterm debt, and tax equity liabilities are classified at amortized cost.\n(iii) Finance income and finance costs\nInvestment income on financial assets at amortized cost and FVOCI are amortized using the\neffective interest rate method.\nFinance fees and transaction costs on financial assets at FVTPL are expensed as incurred.\n11\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(g) Expected credit losses:\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, loss allowances for expected credit losses (“ECLs”) on financial\nassets measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI are recognized. ECLs are updated at each\nreporting date on the basis of available information. The Company applies the simplified\napproach described in IFRS 9 to trade receivables, whereby the amount of the impairment\nallowance of a receivable is measured subsequent to initial recognition on the basis of lifetime\nexpected credit losses.\n(h) Tax equity structures\nThe Company owns and operates solar facilities in the US under subsidiaries that are set up as\ntax equity structures to finance the construction and operation of solar facilities. These structures\nare designed to allocate the majority of renewable tax incentives, such as investment tax credits\n(“ITCs”) and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes, to tax equity investors (“TEIs”). With its\ncurrent portfolio of solar facilities, the Company cannot fully monetize such tax incentives and it\ntherefore partners with third party TEIs. Generally, tax equity structures allocate the majority of\nthe project’s US taxable income and renewable tax incentives, along with a portion of the\nproject’s cash flows, to the TEIs until they receive an agreed-upon after-tax investment return\n(the “flip point”). The flip points are generally dependent on the projects’ respective returns but\nalso may be contractually determined. At all times, both before and after the projects’ flip points,\nthe Company retains control over the projects finance with a tax equity structure in partnership\nwith third party TEIs. Subsequent to the flip point, the Company receives the majority of the\nprojects’ taxable income, cash flows and remaining tax incentives.\nWhen a tax equity partnership is formed, the Company assesses whether the project company\nshould be consolidated based on the Company’s right to variable returns and its ability to\ninfluence financial and operational decisions impacting those returns. Due to the operational and\nfinancial nature of the projects, and the protective nature of the rights normally given to tax equity\ninvestors, the Company typically has the control and influence to consolidate the entity.\nAmounts paid by the TEIs for their equity stakes are classified as debt on the consolidated\nstatements of financial position and are measured at amortized cost using the EIR method. The\nCompany has the option to settle with the TEI after the flip date at a defined price and in certain\ncontracts the TEI can put their investment back to the Company after the flip date at the same\ndefined price. These options are generally time bound.\nThe Company recognizes the TEI contributions as a long-term liability, at an amount representing\nthe proceeds received from the TEI in exchange for shares of the subsidiary, net of the following\nelements affecting amortized cost of the tax equity:\n• ITC: Allocation of ITCs to the TEI is recognized in other income and as a reduction of\ntax equity.\n• Taxable income (loss), including tax attributes such as accelerated tax depreciation:\nAllocation of taxable income and other tax attributes to the TEI is recognized in other\n(income) expenses as incurred and as a reduction of tax equity.\n• Cash distributions: Cash allocation to the TEI is recognized as a reduction of tax equity.\nTax equity balances are increased by interest recognized at the implicit interest rate.\n12\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(i) Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to\ncommon shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares\noutstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential\ncommon shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock\nmethod. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\n(j) Impairment of non-financial assets:\nAt each reporting date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets\nincluding property, plant and equipment (other than deferred tax assets) to determine whether\nthere is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable\namount is estimated.\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into cash-generating units (“CGUs”) which\nare the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely\nindependent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs. The recoverable amount of an asset\nor CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Value in use is\nbased on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax\ndiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks\nspecific to the asset or CGU.\nImpairment losses are recognized in profit or loss. The Company evaluates impairment losses,\nexcept goodwill, for potential reversals when events or circumstances warrant such\nconsideration. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount\ndoes not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or\namortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.\n(k) Income taxes:\nIncome tax represents current tax and deferred tax. The Company and its subsidiaries record\ncurrent tax based on the taxable income for the period calculated using tax rates that have been\nenacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred income taxes are accounted\nfor using the liability method. The asset-liability method requires that income taxes reflect the\nexpected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of\nassets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are\ndetermined for each temporary difference based on enacted or substantially enacted tax rates\nthat are expected to be in effect when the underlying items are expected to be realized. The\neffect of a change in tax rates or tax legislation is recognized in the period of substantive\nenactment. Deferred tax assets, such as non-capital loss carry forwards, are recognized to the\nextent it is probable that taxable income will be available against which the asset can be utilized.\n13\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(l) Property, plant and equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including all directly attributable costs\nto bring the assets to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the\nmanner intended by management. Property, plant and equipment are subsequently measured\nat cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is computed on a\ndeclining balance basis based on the nature and useful lives of the assets. The significant\nclasses of plant and equipment and their estimated useful lives are as follows:\nComputer equipment 55%\nFurniture and equipment 20%\nLeasehold improvement Lesser of lease term and useful life\nSolar facility 5-year MACRS\nSubsequent costs that meet the asset recognition criteria are capitalized, while costs incurred\nthat do not extend the economic useful life of an asset are considered repairs and maintenance,\nwhich are accounted for as an expense recognized during the year.\n(m) Development asset:\nDevelopment assets consists of design, development, engineering, interconnection, permitting,\nand acquisition costs associated with new solar facilities. These costs are capitalized within\nproject development costs until construction begins, at which time they are transferred to property,\nplant and equipment. The Company capitalizes these costs when it believes the facilities will more\nlikely than not be constructed.\n(n) Share based payment transactions:\nThe Company makes share-based awards, including restricted share units (“RSUs”) and stock\noptions to employees, officers, directors, and consultants.\nFor equity-settled awards, the fair value is charged to the consolidated statements of income and\ncredited to equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, after adjusting for the estimated\nnumber of awards that are expected to vest. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on\nquoted market price of our common shares at the date of grant. The fair value of the stock options\ngranted to employees, officers, and directors is determined at the date of grant using the Black-\nScholes option pricing model with market related input. The fair value of stock options granted to\nconsultants is measured at the fair value of the services delivered unless that fair value cannot\nbe estimated reliably, which then is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nStock options with graded vesting schedules are accounted for as separate grants with different\nvesting periods and fair values.\nAt each reporting date prior to vesting, the cumulative expense representing the extent to which\nthe vesting period has expired and management’s best estimate of the awards that are ultimately\nexpected to vest is computed (after adjusting for non-market performance conditions). The\nmovement in cumulative expense is recognized in the consolidated statements of income with a\ncorresponding entry within equity. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately\nvest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated\nas vested irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other\nperformance conditions are satisfied.\n14\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(o) Leases:\nThe Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract.\nA lease is recognized as a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability at the\ncommencement date. Each lease payment included in the lease liability is apportioned between\nthe repayment of the liability and an interest expense in profit or loss. Lease liabilities represent\nthe net present value of fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments); variable\nlease payments based on an index, rate, or subject to a fair market value renewal condition;\namounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, the exercise\nprice of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and payments\nof penalties for terminating the lease, if it is probable that the lessee will exercise that option.\n(p) Government grant:\nThe government grant is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will\ncomply with any conditions attached to the grant, and the grant will be received. The government\ngrant is recognized in profit or loss to offset the related expenses on a systematic basis over the\nperiods in which the Company recognizes expenses for the related costs for which the grants are\nintended to compensate, which in the case of grants related to assets requires setting up the\ngrant as deferred income or deducting it from the carrying amount of the asset.\n(q) Significant accounting judgments and estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to use accounting estimates and\nexercise judgment in the process of applying its accounting policies. Actual results may differ\nfrom the estimates and assumptions used in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\nEstimates and judgments are regularly evaluated and are based on management’s experience\nand other factors, including expectations about future events that are believed to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances. The following discusses the most significant accounting judgments\nand estimates that the Company has made in the preparation of the consolidated financial\nstatements:\n(i) Taxes:\nThe Company accounts for differences that arise between the carrying amount of assets\nand liabilities and their tax bases in accordance with IAS 12, Income Taxes, which requires\ndeferred income tax assets only to be recognized to the extent that it is probable that future\ntaxable profits will be available against which the deferred income tax assets can be utilized.\nThe Company estimates future taxable profits based on the future financial models and\nprojections. Any change to the estimates and assumptions used for the key operational and\nfinancial variables could affect the amount of deferred income tax assets recognized by the\nCompany. Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to\nbe paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the\nadequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period.\n(ii) Percentage of completion calculation:\nThe Company measures the stage of completion for EPC projects based on costs incurred\nto date compared to the total estimated costs for the project. The estimation of total\nestimated costs requires judgement and changes to these estimates may affect revenue,\nunbilled revenue, and deferred revenue.\n15\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(iii) Expected credit loss:\nThe Company makes estimates for expected credit loss in respect of accounts receivables\nand other receivables based on IFRS 9 – Financial instruments. The expected credit loss is\nestimated based on management’s assessment of the credit history with the customers,\ncurrent relationship with them and taking into consideration of forward-looking information.\nA change in customers’ payment behaviour or financial position could impact the expected\ncredit loss recorded in the accounts. If actual credit losses differ from estimates, future\nearnings would be affected.\n(iv) Warranties:\nThe Company generally provides a warranty period of one year for its services. Management\napplies estimates in establishing warranty provision on the basis of warranty terms in the\nsales contract and historical experience. For the year ended June 30, 2023, $Nil warranty\nprovision was recorded (2022 - $Nil).\n(v) Contract fulfilment costs:\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting treatment for the costs incurred to fulfil a\ncontract, the Company firstly considers any other applicable standards. If those other\nstandards preclude capitalisation of a particular cost, then an asset is not recognized under\nIFRS 15.\nIf other standards are not applicable to such contract fulfilment costs, the Company applies\nthe following criteria which, if met, result in capitalisation: (i) The costs directly relate to a\ncontract or to a specifically identifiable anticipated contract; (ii) the costs generate or\nenhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy)\nperformance obligations in the future; (iii) the costs are expected to be recovered. The\nassessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when\nconsidering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance\nobligations and whether costs are expected to be recoverable.\n16\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\nThe Company has determined that, where the relevant specific criteria are met, the costs\ndirectly relate to engineering services, procurement and construction services rendered are\nlikely to qualify to be capitalised as contract fulfilment assets.\nJudgement is applied by the Company when determining what costs qualify to be capitalised\nin particular when these costs are incremental and whether these are expected to be\nrecoverable.\n(vi) Convertible debenture:\nThe determination of the fair value of convertible debentures requires the input of highly\nsubjective assumptions, including the expected discount rate. Changes in the input\nassumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.\n(vii) Stock-based compensation and warrant valuation:\nThe fair value of stock options issued and warrants granted are subject to the limitation of\nthe Black-Scholes option pricing model which incorporates market data, and which involves\nuncertainty and subjectivity in estimates used by management in the assumptions. The\nmodel requires assumptions relating to share price volatility, expected life of options and\ndiscount rate. Changes in these assumptions affect the fair value of the options and the\namount of stock-based compensation to be recognized in operations over the vesting period.\n(viii) Tax equity liabilities\nThe Company makes estimates in the determination of expected future cash flows to\ncalculate the effective interest rate (“EIR”) and amortization of tax equity liabilities. Tax equity\ninvestors generally require a specified allocation of the project’s cash distributions and tax\nattributes such as investment tax credit and taxable income or loss, including accelerated\ntax depreciation. Estimates are made when determining the amount and allocation of cash\ndistributions and tax attributes to the tax equity investors, which may be influenced by a\nnumber of assumptions such as electricity production, selling prices, costs to operate and\ntax amounts.\n(ix) Determining control or significant influence of special purpose entities\nThe determination of whether the Company has control or significant influence over special\npurpose entities requires the Company to make assumptions and judgments in evaluating\nits specific control and influence characteristics. The Company exercises judgment in\ndetermining whether non-wholly owned special purpose entities are controlled by the\nCompany, which involves the assessment of how the decisions of the special purpose\nentities are made, whether the rights of other partners are protective or substantive in nature,\nand the ability of the Company to influence the returns of the special purpose entity.\n(x) Acquisitions\nManagement has had to apply judgment relating to acquisitions with respect to whether the\nacquisition was a business combination or an asset acquisition. Management applied a\nthree-element process to determine whether a business or an asset was purchased,\nconsidering inputs, processes and outputs of each acquisition in order to reach a conclusion.\n17\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n3. Significant accounting policies (continued)\n(r) Utilization, derecognition and impairment of contract fulfilment costs:\nThe Company utilises contract fulfilment costs to cost of goods sold over the expected contract\nperiod using a systematic basis that mirrors the pattern in which the Company transfers control\nof the services to the customer.\nA contract fulfilment costs is derecognised either when it is disposed of or when no further\neconomic benefits are expected to flow from its use or disposal.\nAt each reporting date, the Company determines whether or not the contract fulfilment costs are\nimpaired by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the remaining amount of consideration\nthat the Company expects to receive less the costs that relate to providing services under the\nrelevant contract. In determining the estimated amount of consideration, the Company uses the\nsame principles as it does to determine the contract transaction price, except that any constraints\nused to reduce the transaction price will be removed for the impairment test.\n(s) Convertible debenture:\nThe Company evaluates the terms of its financial instruments to determine whether it contains\nboth a liability and an equity component. The Company recognizes separately the components\nof a financial instrument that create a financial liability and grants an option to the holder of the\ninstrument to convert it into equity of the Company. On initial recognition, the instrument’s fair\nvalue is allocated between the liability and the equity components using the residual method. The\nfair value of any derivative feature embedded in the compound financial instrument (other than\nthe equity component, such as an equity conversion feature) is presented as a liability instrument.\n(t) Accounting standards issued but not yet effective:\nThe following new and revised accounting standard, along with any consequential amendments\nwas adopted by the Company for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\nIAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8 to clarify how reporting entities should\ndistinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The\namendments include a definition of “accounting estimates” as well as other amendments to IAS\n8 that will help entities distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting\nestimates. This distinction between these two types of changes is important as changes in\naccounting policies are normally applied retrospectively to past transactions and events, whereas\nchanges in accounting estimates are applied prospectively to future transactions and events.\nIAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”\nand IFRS Practice Statement 2 “Making Materiality Judgements” aiming to improve accounting\npolicy disclosures. The amendments to IAS 1 require reporting entities to disclose their material\naccounting policy information rather than their significant accounting policies. The amendments\nto IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on how to apply the concept of materiality to\naccounting policy disclosures.\nThe Company does not expect the adoption of these new amendments to have a significant\nimpact as the amendments only affect the note disclosure of the financial statements.\n18\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n4.

Management expects the accounts receivable is fully collectible once SFT receive the\npayments from the Ontario government in respect of terminated contracts. With the expectation\nof collection from SFT, the Company recovered $212,227 allowance for doubtful account\nrecorded in previous year and recognized the amount in other income for the year ended June\n30, 2023. In June 2023, the Company acquired partnership units from SFT, see note 21.\n5. Prepaid expenses and deposits\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nInterconnection deposits(1) $ 469,725 $ 2,008,441\nConstruction in progress deposit(2) 1,623,209 -\nSecurity deposits 12,352 14,852\nPrepaid insurance 74,373 18,335\nPrepaid rent - 7,297\nPrepaid marketing expenses(3) 782,101\nOther prepaids and deposits 92,918 11,530\n$ 3,054,678 $ 2,060,455\n(1) Interconnection deposits are made to the utility companies for the connection cost of each project\nthat completes a CESIR report (Coordinated Electric System Interconnection Review) with that\nutility. The utility companies complete their analysis and provide an estimated cost to connect\nthe project to the grid when ready. To hold the place in the utility line and reserve grid capacity\nfor said project, the estimated connection cost must be paid ahead of time which is what\ncomprises the interconnection deposits amount. The Interconnection deposit would become a\npart of the cost of sales once the projects reach commercial operation.\n(2) Deposits related prepayments made on the purchase of raw materials required for construction\nof Independent Power Producer projects, Manlius and Geddes, located in New York, USA.\n(3) The Company hired two investor relations and marketing consultant companies to increase the\nCompany’s visibility in the market and to explore over-seas markets.

Acquisitions\nSolar Alliance DevCo LLC\nAbundant Solar Power (“ASP”) has an EPC agreement with Solar Alliance Energy Inc (“Solar\nAlliance”) to be engaged in the development, engineering, procurement, construction, and operations\nof solar energy facilities (US1 & VC1 projects). The US1 & VC1 projects reached PTO (permission\nto operation) in December 2022. According to the EPC agreement, ASP had fulfilled its performance\nobligation and was able to recognize EPC services revenue at the amount of $1,340,765 CAD\n($1,082,345 USD) when US1 & VC1 projects were reached PTO.\nOn December 28, 2022, the Company entered into a promissory note with Solar Alliance converting\na series of overdue accounts receivables of $1,206,004 (USD $891,158) since August 2022 to a\nnote receivable. The promissory note bears interest rate of 15% per annum and was payable on a\nmonthly basis.\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company settled the outstanding promissory note of $1,206,004 (USD\n$891,158) plus accrued interest of $111,821 (USD $82,203) through the acquisition of 67% of in\nSolar Alliance DevCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Solar Alliance, under the terms of membership\ninterest purchase agreement. As a result of the acquisition, Solar Alliance DevCo operates as a\nsubsidiary of ASP. Solar Alliance DevCo holds two solar energy facilities (US1 & VC1) which have\nreached commercial operation stage. As a result, the Company has determined that this transaction\nis a business combination as the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business. The\ntransaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting whereby the assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date.\nThe provisional allocation of the purchase consideration to the total fair value of net assets acquired\nis as follows:\nFair value of net assets acquired $\nAccounts receivable 407,210\nCapital assets 937,194\nAccounts payable (25,851)\nTax equity liability (460,607)\nIdentifiable net assets acquired 857,946\nNon-controlling interest (283,122)\nPurchase consideration transferred 574,824\nOn acquisition, the purchase consideration transferred of $574,824 is the fair value of the promissory\nnote plus accrued interest as of June 20, 2023. Hence, the Company recognized an impairment loss\nof $724,205 (USD $539,204) from the remeasurement of promissory note to its fair value as of the\nacquisition date. The impairment loss was recognized in profit and loss.\nThe Company also recognized $283,122 (USD $213,838) for 33% non-controlling interest in Solar\nAlliance DevCo.\n21\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n8.

The loan has a ten-year\namortization period with interest payment only for the first year. Principal payments are to\ncommence in May 2022. During the year ended June 30, 2023, the interest recorded and paid\nwas $37,214 (2022 - $39,970).\n(2) The Company received a Canada Emergency Business Account (“CEBA”) interest-free loan for a\ntotal of $60,000 from the Government of Canada. The loan bears interest at 0% per annum and\nis repayable by December 31, 2023.

Tax equity\nOn June 20, 2023 the Company acquired 67% membership interest in an entity which owns and\noperates certain solar facilities in the US under subsidiaries that are set up as tax equity structures\nto finance the capital cost of the solar facilities. Amounts paid by the TEIs for their equity stakes are\nclassified as debt on the consolidated statements of financial position and are measured at amortized\ncost using the effective interest rate (“EIR”) method. Amortized cost is affected by the allocation of\nITCs, taxable income, and accelerated tax depreciation. Financing expenses represent the interest\naccretion using the EIR. The EIR of the tax equity was determined to be 9%, the loan value was\n$549,061 (USD 414,699), with a maturity date (representing the expected flip point as estimated) of\n2028 and the percentage of ownership between 99%, reflecting the allocation of taxable income or\nloss prior to the flip date.\nTax equity investors in US solar projects generally require sponsor guarantees as a condition to their\ninvestment. To support the tax equity investments, the Company executed guarantees indemnifying\nthe tax equity investors against certain breaches of project level representations, warranties and\ncovenants and other events. The Company believe these indemnifications cover matters which are\nsubstantially under its control and are very unlikely to occur.\n17. Convertible debenture\nIn October 2022, the Company completed a convertible bridge loan financing for gross proceeds of\n$1,250,000 (the “Convertible Loan”). Upon the closing of the initial public offering, the proceeds of\nthe Convertible Loan converted into Conversion Units at a conversion price of $0.50 per Conversion\nUnit (or 2,500,000 Conversion Units). Each Conversion Unit consists of one Common Share, one\nSeries A Warrant and on Series B Warrant.\nEach Series A Warrant entitle the lenders to purchase one common share at a price of $0.50 upon\nthe satisfaction of the Series A vesting condition that is the Warrant shall become exercisable upon\nthe Company attaining a fully diluted market capitalization of CAD $20M calculated by multiplying all\nof the issued and outstanding common shares and convertible securities of the Company by its\nclosing price on the stock exchange where its primary trading occurs. The Series A vesting condition\nwas satisfied on the closing date of the IPO. As a result, 2,500,000 Series A warrants vested on\nMarch 1, 2023.\nEach Series B Warrant entitle the lenders to purchase one common share at a price of $0.50 upon\nthe satisfaction of the Series B vesting condition that is the Warrant shall become exercisable upon\nthe Company completing a listing on a senior Canadian or United States stock exchange such that\nthe Company is not designated as a venture issuer. This condition has not yet been satisfied.\nBoth Series A Warrant and Series B Warrant expires 60 months from the closing of the initial public\noffering.\nOn inception, the Company allocated the total proceeds received between the liability and equity\ncomponents of the convertible debenture using the residual method, based on a discount rate of\n10%, which is the estimated cost at which the Company could borrow similar debt without a\nconversion feature. The liability component with a fair value of $1,136,364 on inception is measured\nat amortized cost and is accrued over the expected term to maturity using the effective interest\nmethod. The equity component with a fair value of $113,636 on inception is presented as a\ncomponent of shareholders’ equity. On March 1, 2023, the full liability portion of the Convertible Loan\nconverted to 2,500,000 Common Shares. A continuity of the liability portion of the convertible\ndebentures is as follows:\nBalance, June 30, 2022 -\nInitial recognition $ 1,136,364\nAccretion interest expenses 47,348\nConversion of Loan upon IPO (1,183,712)\nBalance, June 30 2023 $ -\n26\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n18. Financial instruments\nThe Company as part of its operations carries financial instruments consisting of cash, trade\nreceivables, accounts payable and accruals, loan payable, and long-term debt.\n(a) Fair value:\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are measured and recognized\naccording to a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to\nmeasure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active\nmarkets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The\nthree levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\n• Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\nCash is carried at fair value using a Level 1 fair value measurement. The Company do not have\nLevel 2 and Level 3 financial instrument.\nThe carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, due from and due to related parties, trade\nand other payables approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these items.\nThe carrying amounts of loan payable, lease liabilities and long-term debt approximate their fair\nvalue as they are discounted at the current market rate of interest.\n(b) Financial risk management:\n(i) Credit risk and economic dependence:\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss associated with the counterparty's inability to fulfill its\npayment obligations. The Company has no significant credit risk with its counterparties. The\ncarrying amount of financial assets net of impairment, if any, represents the Company’s\nmaximum exposure to credit risk.\nThe Company has assessed the creditworthiness of its trade and other receivables and\namount determined the credit risk to be low. Utility deposits are made to local government\nutility with high creditworthiness. Cash has low credit risk as it is held by internationally\nrecognized financial institutions.\n(ii) Concentration risk and economic dependence:\nThe outstanding accounts receivable balance is relatively concentrated with a few large\ncustomers representing majority of the value. See table below showing a few customers\nwho account for over 10% of total revenue as well as customers who account for over 10%\npercentage of outstanding Accounts Receivable. Outstanding accounts payable balance is\nrelatively concentrated with a few large customers representing majority of the value. See\ntable below showing a few vendors who account for over 10% of total purchases as well as\nvendors who account for over 10% of outstanding accounts payable.\n27\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n18.

The Company’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have\nsufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due by maintaining adequate reserves, banking\nfacilities, and borrowing facilities. All of the Company’s financial liabilities are subject to normal\ntrade terms.\n(iv) Interest rate risk:\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will\nfluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company does not carry debt at a\nvariable rate and is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash which is not considered significant.\n28\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n19.

Subsequent events\na) In June 2022, a group of residents filed an Article 78 lawsuit against town of Manlius, New York,\nover solar panel project on town property. The lawsuit was filed challenging the approval of the\nManlius landfill. The company, in cooperation with the town, is vigorously defending this suit.\nThe proceeding was dismissed, but the petitioners have appealed subsequent to December 31,\n2022. A second case against the town and Company by one of the original petitioners was filed\nin November 2022 largely mirroring the first challenge. On November 30, 2022, the case was\ndismissed as to all claims against the Company, one claim under the Open Meeting Law against\nthe town remains. Motions for summary judgement on that claim by the town and Company are\ncurrently pending. The case does not represent a material threat to the Company.\nb) On July 5, 2023, the Company acquired 42,500 limited partnership units of Solar Flow-Through\n2016 Limited Partnership for an aggregate purchase price of $2,465,000.\nc) During the quarter ended September 30, 2023 the Company sold 2,200 Common Shares\nthrough at-the-market offerings at an average price of $10 per share for gross proceeds of\n$22,003.96.\nd) On September 19, 2023, the Company completed a sale of 21 MW DC ground-mount solar\npower projects (the “SB Projects”) that are under development in upstate New York to Honeywell\nInternational Inc. (“Honeywell”). The Company will build the SB Projects for Honeywell to\ncommercial operation via an EPC” agreement. The sale of the SB Projects and EPC agreement\nhave a total value of approximately USD $41 million. The Company also expects that it will retain\nan operations and maintenance contract for the SB Projects following the completion of\nconstruction.\ne) On October 3, 2023, the Company entered into an EPC agreement for the construction of three\nseparate Battery Energy Storage System (“BESS”) projects (the “BESS Projects”) with a total\ncontract value of approximately $36 million. The projects are owned by Solar Flow-Through\nFunds, two First Nations communities, and a third party developer in Ontario.\nf) On October 10, 2023, the Company received a demand letter from US lawyers Dan Juhl\nclaiming that the company is infringing Mr. Juhl’s trademark rights. Mr. Juhl holds a trademark\nregistration for SOLARBANK in association with “Electric power generators, namely, reserve\nelectric power generators for the renewable energy sector”. The Company is responding to the\nletter on several grounds, and that confusion to trademark is unlikely because the Company’s\nbusiness and services are very different from the products listed in Mr. Juhl’s application.\ng) The Company has entered into share purchase agreements (the “SPAs”) dated October 23,\n2023 to acquire control of two corporations that hold solar projects located in Ontario with a\ncombined capacity of 2.5 MW (the “Projects”) for consideration of 278,875 common shares (the\n“Consideration Shares”) of the Company (the “OFIT Transaction”). The corporations OFIT GM\nInc. and OFIT RT Inc. (the “Purchased Entities”) have been operating the Projects since 2017.\nThe shares of the Purchased Entities are being acquired from N. Fine Investments Limited and\nLinden Power Inc. Pursuant to the terms of the SPAs, the Company will acquire 49.9%\nownership of OFIT RT Inc. where Whitesand First Nation owns the remaining shares of OFIT\nRT Inc. The Company will also acquire 49.9% ownership of OFIT GM Inc. where the Town of\nKapuskasing owns the remaining shares of OFIT GM Inc. The closing of the OFIT Transaction\nis subject to certain customary conditions including the receipt of consents from lenders to the\nPurchased Entities, landlords for the leases of the solar sites and shareholders of the Purchased\nEntities. Dr. Richard Lu, the President & Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company\nis indirectly a shareholder of the Purchased Entities and will indirectly receive one-third of the\nConsideration Shares. As a result, the Transaction is considered a related party transaction.\n36\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nNotes to Consolidate Financial Statements\nYears ended June 30, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)\n27.

The Company commenced trading its common shares on the Canadian\nSecurities Exchange (the “CSE”) under the symbol “SUNN” on March 2, 2023.\nThe Company is a growing renewable energy sector Company that specializes in delivering solar and other renewable\nenergy power plants in Canada and the United States of America. Throughout its years in business, the Company has\nworked to provide safe, reliable and low-cost solar power plants that would generate solar renewable electricity to: (a)\naddress the growing requirements to reduce carbon emissions in the form of Solar Renewable Energy Credits\n(“SREC”); and (b) provide a cost competitive alternative to conventional electricity generation to further decarbonize\nthe electricity grid.\nAs an established independent renewable and clean energy project developer and asset operator, the Company is\nengaged in the site origination, development, engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”), operation and\nmaintenance (“O&M”), and asset management of a solar power plants, whether electricity grid interconnected or\nbehind-the-meter (“BTM”) solar photovoltaic power plants on roofs of commercial and/or industrial buildings, or\nground-mount solar farms, community-scale or utility-scale in size. The solar power plants could be net metered or\nvirtual net metered to supply renewable energy to a specific commercial and industrial customer, or supply the green\nenergy to community solar subscribers, or sell the renewable power or SREC to utilities in order to meet their\nRenewable Procurement Standard (“RPS”) compliance requirement or large corporations in meeting their carbon\nemission reduction limits or Net-Zero targets, such as NZ2050 or NZ2035.\nThe Company is shifting its business model from a “develop to sell” strategy to the ownership of renewable projects\nas an Independent Power Producer. The Company will accelerate its portfolio growth via organic growth and M&A.\nSelected Annual Information\nComparative information for annual periods from June 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 has been presented in accordance\nwith IFRS.\n2023 2022 2021\nYear ended June 30 (Audited) (Audited) (Audited)\n($) ($) ($)\nRevenue 18,397,509 10,197,619 7,346,581\nRevenue - EPC 15,577,210 9,791,511 3,230,366\nRevenue – development 2,724,040 406,108 4,116,215\nRevenue – O&M services 96,259 - -\nCost of goods sold (13, 860,309) (8,231,476) (4,814,144)\nNet income (loss) 2,241,986 (188,393) (157,067)\nNet income (loss) per share 0.11 (0.01) (0.01)\nTotal assets 24,969,537 9,194,537 10,283,255\nLong-term debt 1,254,465 1,388,013 1,143,242\nDividends - - -\nThe following discussion addresses the operating results and financial condition of the Company for the year ended\nJune 30, 2023 compared with the year ended June 30, 2022.

The US1 &\nVC1 projects were reached PTO (permission to operation) in Dec 2022. According to the EPC agreement, ASP had\nfulfilled its performance obligation and was able to recognize EPC services revenue at the amount of $1,340,765 CAD\n($1,082,345 USD) when US1 & VC1 projects reached PTO.\nOn December 28, 2022, the Company entered into a promissory note with Solar Alliance converting a series of\noverdue accounts receivables of $1,206,004 (USD $891,158) since August 2022 to a note receivable. The promissory\nnote bears interest rate of 15% per annum and was payable on a monthly basis.\nOn June 20, 2023, the Company settled the outstanding promissory note of $1,206,004 (USD $891,158) plus\naccrued interest of $111,821 (USD $82,203) through the acquisition of 67% of in Solar Alliance DevCo LLC\n(“Solar Alliance DevCo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Solar Alliance, under the terms of membership interest\npurchase agreement. As a result of the acquisition, Solar Alliance DevCo operates as a subsidiary of ASP.

As\na result, the Company has determined that this transaction is a business combination as the assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed constitute a business. The transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of\naccounting whereby the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values at the\nacquisition date.\nOn acquisition, the purchase consideration transferred of $574,824 is the fair value of the promissory note plus accrued\ninterest as of June 20, 2023. Hence, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $724,205 (USD $539,204) from\nthe remeasurement of promissory note to its fair value as of the acquisition date. The impairment loss was recognized\nin profit or loss.\nThe Company also recognized $283,122 (USD $213,838) for 33% non-controlling interest in Solar Alliance DevCo.\nDiscussion of Operations and Outlook\nSolar PV Technology\nThe Company is in the business of developing solar photovoltaic (“PV”) projects. PV devices generate electricity\ndirectly from sunlight via an electronic process that occurs naturally in certain types of material, called\nsemiconductors. Electrons in these materials are freed by solar energy and can be induced to travel through an\nelectrical circuit, powering electrical devices or sending electricity to the grid.\nSolar power is not dependent on burning fossil fuels or other products; instead, it uses electrons captured from the\nsun’s energy for electricity creation. Therefore, solar energy does not create greenhouse gases for energy production.\nMost modern solar cells are made from crystalline silicon semiconductor material. Silicon cells are more efficient at\nconverting sunlight to electricity, but generally have higher manufacturing costs.\nThe cost of PV has dropped dramatically as the industry has scaled up manufacturing and incrementally improved the\ntechnology with new materials. Installation costs have come down too with more experienced and trained installers.\nUsing the PV technology the Company develops, builds, and operates behind-the-meter (BTM) solar power plants,\nelectricity grid connected community solar gardens, and utility scale solar farms\nBTM Solar Power Plants\nThe Company is a turn-key service provider to commercial and industrial customers for them to own BTM solar power\nplant on-site. The Company can also invest and own the BTM solar projects where local policies allow commercial\naggregation and 3rd party ownership.\nThe most effective method to achieve Net-Zero carbon emissions from buildings is to build them all electric, with\nBTM solar power plants on-site to generate zero emission renewable solar power for the building’s self-use. The BTM\nsolar power plants are reasonable in size (average 300 kWp) as rooftop, carport or ground mount systems. A BTM\nsolar power plant can be net metered, through which the excess solar energy produced by the plant can be sent back\nto the grid in return for a credit or money from the local utility. BTM solar power plants have the following benefits:\n• Self-consumption of distributed generation,\n• Energy cost savings,\n• Control project operations and maintenance,\n• Visible commitment to sustainability, and\n• Resiliency (with battery storage).\nBTM solar power generation provides a readily available solution toward the goal of Net-Zero by 2050. There has\nbeen an increased interest in BTM solar power plants as an effective way to halt climate change. The Company is\nexperienced in BTM solar and currently manages a number of BTM solar power plants. It is anticipated that the\nCompany will be able to develop and build 2 MWp BTM solar power plants in 2024 in Canada and the USA.\nOn September 18, 2023 the Company and Honeywell entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the\n“Honeywell MIPA”) and an EPC agreement (the “Honeywell EPC Agreement”) pursuant to which Honeywell\nacquired the SB-1, SB-2 and SB-3 projects and retained the Company for their construction, with a total transaction\nvalue of US$41 million. The Company also expects that it will retain an operations and maintenance contract for the\nSB projects following the completion of construction.\nCommunity Solar Farms\nCommunity solar refers to local solar PV facilities shared by multiple community subscribers who receive credit on\ntheir electricity bills for their share of the power produced. Community solar provides homeowners, renters, and\nbusinesses equal access to the economic and environmental benefits of solar energy generation regardless of the\nphysical attributes or ownership of their home or business. Community solar expands access to solar for all, including\nin particular low-to-moderate income customers most impacted by a lack of access, all while building a stronger,\ndistributed, and more resilient electric grid. Community solar power plants are usually less than seven (7) megawatts\n(MWdc) of electrical capacity, and it could power about 1,000 homes (the average American household uses\napproximately 10,000 kWh per year).\nThe Company works with 3rd party subscriber organizations in Boston and Chicago to manage its current 7,000 or so\ncommunity solar subscribers. The Company brought 6 projects, total of 12.1 MWp, to COD in 2023.It is anticipated\nthat the Company will deliver 30 MWp community solar farms with an additional more than 3,000 subscribers in year\n2024.\nOn September 26, 2023 the Company announced that it has completed mechanical construction of the Community\nSolar Project in the Town of Manlius, Onondaga County, New York. The 5.9MW Project was constructed for Solar\nAdvocate Development LLC under the terms of the Manlius EPC Agreement. All civil work is complete, along with\nthe mechanical installation of racking and modules. The next step is completion of some final electrical work and\nacceptance testing. The project is expected to become operational during the fourth quarter of calendar year 2023.\nOn October 2, 2023 the Company announced that it has commenced major construction on the Geddes project that is\nbeing developed by the Company in Geddes, New York. Current activities include civil work and the commencement\nof the racking and module installation. Subject to receipt of financing, the Company intends to own and operate the\nGeddes project. The Geddes project which has a designed capacity of 3.7 megawatts MW DC is repurposing a closed\nlandfill, addressing two critical challenges: the need for clean energy and the transformation of contaminated sites into\nvaluable assets. Based on its forecast project schedule, the Company anticipates that construction of the Geddes project\nwill be completed in the 1st quarter of calendar 2024.\nUtility Solar Farms\nA utility-scale solar farm is one which generates solar power and feeds it into the grid, supplying a customer with\nrenewable solar energy. A ‘utility-scale’ solar project is usually defined as such if it is 10 MW or bigger in capacity\nof energy production.\nWhat distinguishes utility-scale solar from distributed generation is both project size and the fact that the electricity is\nsold to wholesale energy buyers, not end-use consumers. Virtually every utility-scale solar facility has a power\npurchase Agreement (PPA) with a corporation, an IPP or a utility, guaranteeing a market for its energy for a fixed\nterm of time.\nUtility-scale solar farm has become a growing source of electricity in the world. Many companies will need to partner\nwith solutions providers such as the Company to help put them on a net-zero trajectory. The Company is actively\nadvancing its utility scale solar farms pipeline of 200 MWp and anticipates to further developing a 28 MWp utility\nscale solar farm in 2024.\nBattery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)\nThe Company is actively participating with a development partner in the Ontario IESO Competitive RFP Procurement\nof Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). On behalf of the customers, the Company won three BESS projects in\n2023. On October 3, 2023, the Company entered into three EPC agreements for the construction of these three separate\nBESS projects (the “BESS Projects”) that were previously announced in June 2023, with a total contract value of\napproximately $36 million. The Projects are owned by SFF, two First Nations communities, and a third party\ndeveloper in Ontario through holding companies. The BESS Projects are known as 903, OZ-1 and SFF 06 and are\nsubject to the following agreements:\n(i) Engineering, Procurement & Construction Agreement dated October 3, 2023 between 1000234763\nOntario Inc. and the Company for 903 Project;\n(ii) Engineering, Procurement & Construction Agreement dated October 3, 2023 between 1000234813\nOntario Inc. and the Company for OZ-1 Project; and\n(iii) Engineering, Procurement & Construction Agreement dated October 3, 2023 between 1000234763\nOntario Inc. and the Company for SFF 06 Project.\nThe BESS Projects were awarded as part of a procurement process with the Ontario IESO known as “E-LT1”. Projects\nunder the E-LT1 are expected to be operational no later than April 30, 2026, but the Company intends to have them\ncompleted for operation by the summer of 2025. Each BESS Project is expected to operate under a long term contract\nwith guaranteed capacity payments from the IESO, provided all contract obligations are met. The Projects will also\nearn revenue from the energy and ancillary markets in Ontario. Each has a 4.74 MW discharge capacity with a four-\nhour duration using lithium-iron-phosphate technology. Lithium-iron-phosphate technology allows for the greatest\nnumber of charge/discharge cycles, making it the optimal selection for stationary energy storage systems.\nLegal Matters and Contingent Assets\nThe Company is subject to the following legal matters and contingencies:\n1. In June 2022, a group of residents filed an Article 78 lawsuit against town of Manlius, New York, over solar\npanel project on town property that is being developed by the Company. The lawsuit was filed challenging\nthe approval of the Manlius landfill. The Company is not named in the lawsuit; however, in cooperation with\nthe town, the Company is vigorously defending this suit. On October 5, 2022 by decision of the State of New\nYork Supreme Court, the lawsuit was dismissed. However, on October 19, 2022 an appeal was filed by the\npetitioners in the Appellate Division of the State of New York Supreme Court. The likelihood of success in\nthese lawsuits cannot be reasonably predicted.\n2. On June 29, 2018, the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario was sworn in as the new provincial\ngovernment. On July 13, 2018, the new government issued an Order in Council containing the Minister of\nEnergy’s Directive to immediately take all steps necessary to wind down all Feed-In Tariff (FIT) 2, 3, 4 and\n5 contracts where the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) had not issued Notice to Proceed\n(“NTP”). An NTP was issued for a contract when it was ready for construction.\nIn response to the Minister of Energy’s Directive, the IESO issued termination notices to all pre-NTP FIT\ncontract holders on July 16, 2018. However, the notice confirmed FIT Contract provisions for the cost\nrecovery of Pre-Construction Development Costs (“PCDC”) in the event of contract termination. Pre-\nConstruction Development Costs are defined as reasonable costs incurred in development of a project from\ncontract award date to termination date. The total value of the PCDC claims submitted by the Company’s\nsubsidiary, 2467264 Ontario Inc, is $6.3 million. IESO confirmed the full $6.3 million amount during the\nquarter ended March 31, 2023. As of March 31, 2023, $1.4 million have been recovered from IESO and the\nremaining $4.9 million was recorded as receivable.\n3. On December 2, 2020, a Statement of Claim was filed by the Company’s subsidiary, 2467264 Ontario Inc,\nand seven independent solar project developers (collectively the “Plaintiffs”) against the Ontario Ministry of\nEnergy, Northern Development and Mines (“MOE”), the IESO, and John Doe (collectively the\n“Defendants”). Plaintiffs seek damages from the Defendants in the amount of $240 million in lost profits,\n$17.8 million in development costs, and $50 million in punitive damages for misfeasance of public office,\nbreach of contract, inducing the breach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, and\nconspiracy resulting in the wrongful termination of 111 FIT Contracts. 2467264 Ontario Inc. will receive its\nproportionate entitlement of any net legal award based on its economic entitlement of 8.3% to the legal claim.\nThis lawsuit was previously subject to a leave requirement under s. 17 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings\nAct, 2019. However, a recent decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has deemed s. 17 of no force\nand effect (see Poorkid Investments v. HMTQ 2022 ONSC 883). Accordingly, the lawsuit will continue to\nmove forward through the normal course. We expect statements of defence to be served following the\ndetermination of some preliminary motions. No amounts are recognized in these consolidated special purpose\nfinancial statements with respect to this claim.\n4. On January 29, 2021, a second Statement of Claim was filed by the Company’s subsidiary, 2467264 Ontario\nInc, and fourteen independent solar project developer (collectively the “Plaintiffs”) against the MOE, the\nIESO, and Greg Rickford, as Minister of the MOE (collectively the “Defendants”). The Plaintiffs seek\ndamages from the Defendants in the amount of $260 million in lost profits, $26.9 million in development\ncosts, and $50 million in punitive damages for breach of contract and breach of duty of good faith and fair\ndealing resulting in the wrongful termination of 133 FIT contracts. 2467264 Ontario Inc. will receive its\nproportionate entitlement of any net legal award based on its economic entitlement of 0.7% to the legal claim.\nThis second Statement of Claim is separate and in addition to the first Statement of Claim filed. This lawsuit\nwas previously subject to a leave requirement under s. 17 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, 2019.\nHowever, a recent decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has deemed s. 17 of no force and effect\n(see Poorkid Investments v. HMTQ 2022 ONSC 883). Accordingly, the lawsuit will continue to move\nforward through the normal course. We expect statements of defence to be served following the determination\nof some preliminary motions, including a motion to consolidate the two actions into a single action. No\namounts are recognized in these combined special purpose financial statements with respect to this claim.\n5. On October 10, 2023, the Company received a demand letter from US lawyers representing Dan Juhl\nclaiming that the company is infringing Mr. Juhl’s trademark rights.Mr. Juhl holds a trademark registration\nfor SOLARBANK in association with “Electric power generators, namely, reserve electric power generators\nfor the renewable energy sector”. The Company is responding to the letter on several grounds, including that\nMr. Juhl’s trademark is not distinctive in association with power storage products, that Mr. Juhl does not\nappear to be using the SOLARBANK trademark with products, and that confusion to trademark is unlikely\nbecause the Company’s business and services are very different from the products listed in Mr. Juhl’s\napplication. The Company’s response will also indicate that it does not and has no intension of offering\nconsumer products under the name “solar bank”.\nSummary of Quarterly Results\nQ4 Q3 Q2 Q1\nJune 30, 2023 March 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022\nDescription ($) ($) ($) ($)\nRevenue 9,245,267 706,856 2,964,934 5,480,452\nIncome (Loss) for\nthe period (1,076,836) 3,064,872 89,468 164,482\nIncome (Loss) per\nshare (basic and (0.06) 0.11 (basic)\ndiluted) 0.09 (diluted) 0.01 0.01\nQ4 Q3 Q2 Q1\nJune 30, 2022 March 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 September 30, 2021\nDescription ($) ($) ($) ($)\nRevenue 388,369 977,562 6,211,631 2,602,057\nIncome (Loss) for\nthe period (880,801) 235,346 399,331 57,731\nIncome (Loss) per\nshare (basic and\ndiluted) (0.06) 0.03 0.02 0.00\nHistorical quarterly results of operations and income per share data do not necessarily reflect any recurring expenditure\npatterns or predictable trends except for the fact that seasonally the Company’s third quarter typically has the smallest\namount of revenue due to winter conditions that are less favorable for construction. The Company’s revenues fluctuate\nfrom quarter to quarter based on the timing of recognition of revenue which is dependent on the stage of the various\nsolar power projects under development. Refer to “Results of Operations” for additional discussion.\nResults of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company generated $9,245,267 in revenue mainly from the Manlius project in\nNew York as a result of an EPC agreement being signed and construction started at end of FY23.\nThe Company reported a comprehensive loss from operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023 of\n$1,076,836 as compared to $880,801 for the three months ended June 30, 2022\nReviews of the major items during the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to the three months ended\nJune 30, 2022 are as follows:\n2023 2022 Change Management Commentary\nAdvertising and promotion (196,576) (990) (195,586) Additional costs incurred in FY23 relating to\ninvestor marketing, including design of new\ncompany logo and website.\nSalary and wages (594,626) (458,764) (135,862) Additional personnel added in FY23 and\nincreased bonus payments\nProfessional fees (534,918) (72,699) (462,219) Increase due to audit fees all incurred in FY23,\nconsulting fees relating to PCDC claims, and\nlegal fees relating to Shelf Prospectus, ATM,\ntrademarks etc.\nOffice, rent and utilities (108,582) (119,573) 10,991 Change due to timing of expenses incurred.\nStock based compensation (325,399) - (325,399) Stock based compensation issued in FY23.\nLiquidity\nAs at June 30, 2023, the Company had a cash balance of $749,427 (June 30, 2022 - $931,977) with working capital\nsurplus of $14,962,023 (June 30, 2022 - $5,617,200).\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nAs at\n$ $\nCash 749,427 931,977\nWorking capital 14,962,023 5,617,200\nTotal assets 24,969,537 9,194,537\nTotal liabilities 8,338,341 4,753,922\nShareholders’ equity 16,631,196 4,440,615\nThe Company believes that with the proceeds of the IPO, along with its expected operating income and cash flows, it\nhas sufficient working capital to continue its operations for the next twelve months. To date, the Company’s operations\nhave been financed from cash flows from operations and debt financing. The Company will continue to identify\nfinancing opportunities, including equity issuances, in order to provide additional financial flexibility and execute on\nthe Company’s growth plans. While the Company has been successful raising the necessary funds in the past, there\ncan be no assurance it can do so in the future.\nTo assist with potential liquidity needs, the Company has filed a final short form base shelf prospectus (the \"Shelf\nProspectus\") with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces of Canada. The Shelf Prospectus will\nenable the Company to make offerings of up to $200 million of common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, units\nand share purchase contracts or a combination thereof of the Company from time to time, separately or together, in\namounts, at prices and on terms to be determined based on market conditions at the time of the offering and as set out\nin an accompanying prospectus supplement, during the 25-month period that the Shelf Prospectus remains valid.\nThe nature, size and timing of any such financings (if any) will depend, in part, on the Company’s assessment of its\nrequirements for funding and general market conditions. Unless otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement\nrelating to a particular offering of securities, the net proceeds from any sale of any securities will be used for to advance\nthe Company’s business objectives and for general corporate purposes, including funding ongoing operations or\nworking capital requirements, repaying indebtedness outstanding from time to time, discretionary capital programs\nand potential future acquisitions. The specific terms of any future offering will be established in a prospectus\nsupplement to the Shelf Prospectus, which supplement will be filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory\nauthorities.\nIn addition. The Company has entered into an equity distribution agreement (the \"Distribution Agreement\") with\nResearch Capital Corporation (the \"Agent\") to establish an at-the-market equity program (the \"ATM Program\"). The\nCompany may issue up to $15,000,000 of common shares of the Company (the \"ATM Offered Shares”) from treasury\nunder the ATM Program. The ATM Offered Shares will be issued by the Company to the public from time to time,\nthrough the Agent, at the Company's discretion. The ATM Offered Shares sold under the ATM Program, if any, will\nbe sold at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Since the ATM Offered Shares will be distributed at trading\nprices prevailing at the time of the sale, prices may vary between purchasers and during the period of distribution. The\nCompany intends to use the net proceeds from any sales of ATM Offered Shares under the ATM Program, if any, to\nadvance the Company’s business objectives and for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, funding\nongoing operations or working capital requirements, repaying indebtedness outstanding from time to time,\ndiscretionary capital programs and potential future acquisitions.\nThe Company’s cash is held in highly liquid accounts. No amounts have been or are invested in asset-backed\ncommercial paper.\nCapital Resources\nShare Capital Transactions\nIn October 2022, the Company completed a convertible bridge loan financing for gross proceeds of $1,250,000 (the\n“Convertible Loan”). Upon the closing of the initial public offering, the proceeds of the Convertible Loan shall convert\ninto Conversion Units at a conversion price of $0.50 per Conversion Unit. Each Conversion Unit consists of one\nCommon Share, one Series A Warrant and on Series B Warrant.\nEach Series A Warrant entitle the lenders to purchase one common share at a price of $0.50 upon the satisfaction of\nthe Series A vesting condition that is the Warrant shall become exercisable upon the Company attaining a fully diluted\nmarket capitalization of CAD $20M calculated by multiplying all of the issued and outstanding common shares and\nconvertible securities of the Company by its closing price on the stock exchange where its primary trading occurs.\nThe Series A vesting condition was satisfied on date of the closing of the IPO. As a result, 2,500,000 Series A warrants\nvested on March 1, 2023.\nEach Series B Warrant entitle the lenders to purchase one common share at a price of $0.50 upon the satisfaction of\nthe Series B vesting condition that is the Warrant shall become exercisable upon the Company completing a listing on\na senior Canadian or United States stock exchange such that the Company is not designated as a venture issuer.\nBoth Series A Warrant and Series B Warrant expires 60 months from the closing of the initial public offering.\nOn inception, the Company allocated the total proceeds received between the liability and equity components of the\nconvertible debenture using the residual method, based on a discount rate of 10%, which is the estimated cost at which\nthe Company could borrow similar debt without a conversion feature. The liability component with a fair value of\n$1,136,364 on inception is measured at amortized cost and is accrued over the expected term to maturity using the\neffective interest method. The equity component with a fair value of $113,636 on inception is presented as a\ncomponent of shareholders’ equity. On March 1, 2023, the full liability portion of the Convertible Loan converted to\n2,500,000 Common Shares. A continuity of the liability portion of the convertible debentures is as follows:\nBalance, June 30, 2022 -\nInitial recognition $ 1,136,364\nAccretion interest expenses 47,348\nConversion of Loan upon IPO (1,183,712)\nBalance, June 30, 2023 $ -\nOn March 1, 2023, the Company closed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of common shares of the Company\n(“Common Shares”) raising aggregate gross proceeds of $6,037,500. The IPO consists of 8,050,000 Common Shares\n(including full exercise of the over-allotment option) issued at a purchase price of $0.75 per Common Share. The\nCompany paid $362,250 broker commission, $63,448 legal fees and issued 483,000 broker warrants to purchase\ncommon shares at $0.75 per share until March 1, 2026. The broker warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes\nmodel resulting in fair value of $242,575.

Pursuant to\nthe agreement, each unit is exercisable into one common share of the Company for a period of 60 days from the vesting\ndate. 50% of the units, or 250,000 units, vested on the date of closing of the IPO, which was March 1, 2023, and the\nremaining 50% vests on the date that is 5-months after the date of closing of the IPO (on August 2, 2023). On March\n8, 2023, 250,000 common shares were issued as a result of the vesting of 250,000 RSUs.\nOn March 13, 2023, the Company granted 15,000 RSUs to an employee. Pursuant to the agreement, each unit is\nexercisable into one common share of the Company for a period of 60 days from vesting date. 50% of the units, or\n7,500 units, vest one year after the grant date (on March 12, 2024), and the remaining 50% vest two years after the\ngrant date (on March 12, 2025).\nOn October 3, 2022, the Company granted an aggregated of 2,500,000 warrants as compensation to consultants in\nconnection with the advisory services provided to assist the Company to successfully complete IPO. The warrants\nhave been recorded at their estimated fair value of $1,792,594 during the year ended June 30, 2023. Each fully vested\nwarrant may be exercised at $0.10 to acquire common share. The estimated fair value of the warrants was measured\nusing the Black-Scholes valuation model. The underlying weighted average assumption used in the estimation of fair\nvalue in the Black-Scholes valuation model are as follows:\n• Risk free rate: 3.59%\n• Expected life: 4.69 years;\n• Expected volatility: 126% based on historical five-year trends of industry peers;\n• Expected dividend yield: 0%;\nOn March 1, 2023, the Company granted an aggregate of 483,000 warrants to a brokerage firm as commission for the\ncompletion of the IPO. The warrants have been recorded at their estimated fair value of $248,069 during the year\nended June 30, 2023. Each fully vested warrant may be exercised at $0.75 to acquire a common share. The estimated\nfair value of the warrants was measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The underlying weighted average\nassumption used in the estimation of fair value in the Black-Scholes valuation model are as follows:\n• Risk free rate: 3.85%\n• Expected life: 3 years;\n• Expected volatility: 111% based on historical three-year trends of industry peers;\n• Expected dividend yield: 0%;\nOn November 4, 2022, the Company granted an aggregate of 2,774,000 stock options to employees and directors at\nan exercise price of $0.75 per share, exercisable for a period of 5 years. The options vest over 24 months, 50% per 12\nmonths from grant date. The estimated fair value of these options has been measured using the Black-Scholes valuation\nmodel. During the year ended June 30, 2023, compensation expense related to stock options was $809,628. The\nunderlying weighted average assumption used in the estimation of fair value in the Black-Scholes valuation model are\nas follows:\n• Risk free rate: 3.80%;\n• Expected life: 4 years;\n• Expected volatility: 124% based on historical four-year trends of industry peers;\n• Expected dividend yield: 0%;\nAs at June 30, 2023, no stock options were exercisable.\nCapital Management\nThe Company’s objectives in managing liquidity and capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue as a\ngoing concern and to provide financial capacity to meet its strategic objectives.

The Company\nhas determined it will have sufficient funds to meet its current operating and development obligations for at least 12\nmonths from the reporting date.\nChanges to capital management from the prior year includes closing of Company’s initial public offering of common\nshares on March 1, 2023.\nCapital Structure\nThe Corporation is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares. The table below sets out the\nCompany’s common share and convertible securities as of June 30, 2023 and as of the date of this MD&A:\nSecurity Description June 30, 2023 Date of report\nCommon shares 26,800,000 26,857,200\nWarrants 7,983,000 7,928,000\nStock options 2,759,000 2,759,000\nRestricted share units 265,000 265,000\nFully diluted shares 37,807,000 37,809,200\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2023 the Company did not issue any Common Shares in at-the-market offerings.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions.\nTransactions Between Related Parties\nAs at June 30, 2023, included in trade and other receivable was $Nil (June 30, 2022 - $121,705) due from Sustainable\nInvestment Ltd. (“SIL”). One of SIL’s director is also the controlling shareholder of the Company as at June 30, 2022.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2022, the controlling shareholder of the Company has ceased to be the director of SIL.\nAs at June 30, 2023, included in trade and other receivable was $Nil (June 30, 2022 - $86,000) due from Renewable\nSun Energy Co-Op (“RSE”). One of RSE’s director is also the controlling shareholder of the Company as at June 30,\n2022. Subsequent to June 30, 2022, the controlling shareholder of the Company has ceased to be the director of RSE.\nAs at June 30, 2023, included in loan payable was $Nil (June 30, 2022 - $567,664) shareholder loan advance from a\nshareholder. In 2021, the Company entered into a term loan agreement with a shareholder for a loan of $656,859\n(USD$517,017) with a fixed interest rate of 10% for the first month and 1% for the remaining 11 months compound\nmonthly.

The Company has determined that key management personnel\nconsists of members of the Company’s Board of Directors and corporate officers, including the Company’s Chief\nExecutive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Administrative Officer.\nThe remuneration of directors and other members of key management personnel, for the year ended June 30, 2023\nand 2022 were as follows:\nJune 30, 2023 June 30, 2022\nShort-term employee benefits $ 1,533,393 998,511\nShare-based compensation 440,362\nAdvisory warrants 448,156\nShort-term employee benefits include consulting fees and bonus.\nRelated party transactions are made without stated terms of repayment or interest. The balances with related parties\nare unsecured and due on demand.\nSignificant accounting judgements and estimates\nDespite the fact that the Company determined there are no critical accounting estimates, the most significant\naccounting judgements and estimates that the Company has made in the preparation of the consolidated financial\nstatements includes:\nTaxes:\nThe Company accounts for differences that arise between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their tax\nbases in accordance with IAS 12, Income Taxes, which requires deferred income tax assets only to be recognized to\nthe extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deferred income tax assets\ncan be utilized. The Company estimates future taxable profits based on the future financial models and projections.\nAny change to the estimates and assumptions used for the key operational and financial variables could affect the\namount of deferred income tax assets recognized by the Company. Provisions for taxes are made using the best\nestimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company\nreviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period.\nPercentage of completion calculation:\nThe Company measures the stage of completion for EPC projects based on costs incurred to date compared to the total\nestimated costs for the project. The estimation of total estimated costs requires judgement and changes to these\nestimates may affect revenue, unbilled revenue, and deferred revenue.\nExpected credit loss:\nThe Company makes estimates for expected credit loss in respect of accounts receivables and other receivables based\non IFRS 9 – Financial instruments. The expected credit loss is estimated based on management’s assessment of the\ncredit history with the customers, current relationship with them and taking into consideration of forward-looking\ninformation. A change in customers’ payment behaviour or financial position could impact the expected credit loss\nrecorded in the accounts. If actual credit losses differ from estimates, future earnings would be affected.\nWarranties:\nThe Company generally provides a warranty period of one year for its services. Management applies estimates in\nestablishing warranty provision on the basis of warranty terms in the sales contract and historical experience. For the\nyear ended June 30, 2023, $Nil warranty provision was recorded (2022 - $Nil).\nContract fulfilment costs:\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting treatment for the costs incurred to fulfil a contract, the Company firstly\nconsiders any other applicable standards. If those other standards preclude capitalisation of a particular cost, then an\nasset is not recognized under IFRS 15.\nIf other standards are not applicable to such contract fulfilment costs, the Company applies the following criteria\nwhich, if met, result in capitalisation: (i) The costs directly relate to a contract or to a specifically identifiable\nanticipated contract; (ii) the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in\ncontinuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; (iii) the costs are expected to be recovered. The assessment\nof this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance\nresources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recoverable.\nThe Company has determined that, where the relevant specific criteria are met, the costs directly relate to engineering\nservices, procurement and construction services rendered are likely to qualify to be capitalised as contract fulfilment\nassets.\nJudgement is applied by the Company when determining what costs qualify to be capitalised in particular when these\ncosts are incremental and whether these are expected to be recoverable.\nConvertible debenture:\nThe determination of the fair value of convertible debentures requires the input of highly subjective assumptions,\nincluding the expected discount rate. Changes in the input assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate.\nStock-based compensation and warrant valuation:\nThe fair value of stock options issued and warrants granted are subjective to the limitation of the Black-Scholes option\npricing model which incorporates market data, and which involved uncertainty and subjectivity in estimates used by\nmanagement in the assumptions. The model requires assumptions relating to share price volatility, expected life of\noptions and discount rate. Changes in these assumptions affect the fair value of the options and the amount of stock-\nbased compensation to be recognized in operations over the vesting period.\nTax equity liabilities:\nThe Company makes estimates in the determination of expected future cash flows to calculate the effective interest\nrate (“EIR”) and amortization of tax equity liabilities. Tax equity investors generally require a specified allocation of\nthe project’s cash distributions and tax attributes such as investment tax credit and taxable income or loss, including\naccelerated tax depreciation. Estimates are made when determining the amount and allocation of cash distributions\nand tax attributes to the tax equity investors, which may be influenced by a number of assumptions such as electricity\nproduction, selling prices, costs to operate and tax amounts.\nDetermining control or significant influence of special purpose entities:\nThe determination of whether the Company has control or significant influence over special purpose entities requires\nthe Company to make assumptions and judgments in evaluating its specific control and influence characteristics. The\nCompany exercises judgment in determining whether non-wholly owned special purpose entities are controlled by the\nCompany, which involves the assessment of how the decisions of the special purpose entities are made, whether the\nrights of other partners are protective or substantive in nature, and the ability of the Company to influence the returns\nof the special purpose entity.\nAcquisitions:\nManagement has had to apply judgment relating to acquisitions with respect to whether the acquisition was a business\ncombination or an asset acquisition. Management applied a three-element process to determine whether a business or\nan asset was purchased, considering inputs, processes and outputs of each acquisition in order to reach a conclusion.\nChanges in Accounting Policies\nThe following new and revised accounting standard, along with any consequential amendments were adopted by the\nCompany for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\nIAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 8 to clarify how reporting entities should distinguish changes\nin accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The amendments include a definition of “accounting\nestimates” as well as other amendments to IAS 8 that will help entities distinguish changes in accounting policies from\nchanges in accounting estimates. This distinction between these two types of changes is important as changes in\naccounting policies are normally applied retrospectively to past transactions and events, whereas changes in\naccounting estimates are applied prospectively to future transactions and events.\nIAS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements\nIn February 2021, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” and IFRS Practice\nStatement 2 “Making Materiality Judgements” aiming to improve accounting policy disclosures. The amendments to\nIAS 1 require reporting entities to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their significant\naccounting policies. The amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2 provide guidance on how to apply the concept of\nmateriality to accounting policy disclosures.\nThe Company does not expect the adoption of these new amendments to have a significant impact as the amendments\nonly affect the note disclosure of the financial statements.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments (Management of Financial Risks)\nFair value\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are measured and recognized according to a fair\nvalue hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the\nhighest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority\nto unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n• Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n• Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.\n• Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\nCash is carried at fair value using a Level 1 fair value measurement. The Company do not have Level 2 and Level 3\nfinancial instrument.\nThe carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, due from and due to related parties, trade and other payables\napproximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these items. The carrying amounts of loan payable,\nlease liabilities and long-term debt approximate their fair value as they are discounted at the current market rate of\ninterest.\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss associated with the counterparty’s inability to fulfill its payment obligations.\nThe Company has no significant credit risk with its counterparties.

The Company is engaged in the development, construction\nand operation of solar photovoltaic (“PV”) power generation projects, Battery Energy Storage Systems, and\nEV-Charging projects in Canada and the United States. The Company’s mission is to support the energy\ntransition in North America through deployment of clean energy at a distributed scale closer to where\nconsumption occurs. Its objective is to scale-up as a leading developer, owner and operator of a significant\nfleet of distributed renewable power assets that have economic and technical value. The Company\noriginates, develops, designs and builds solar power projects, BESS and EV-Charging stations. The\nCompany is also gaining expertise in other clean and renewable technologies that will enable greater\npenetration of clean energy.\nThe Company was originally founded in Canada in 2013 as Abundant Solar Energy Inc., and in 2016\nestablished a 100% owned U.S. subsidiary, Abundant Solar Power Inc., to meet the demand for renewable\nenergy in both countries.\nThe Company’s success started with the renewable Feed-In-Tariff (“FIT”) program for rooftop and ground\nmount solar arrays in Ontario, Canada. Since then, the Company has established itself as a trusted developer,\nengineer, builder and asset operator that enables the proliferation of renewable and clean energy in the\npursuit of Net Zero carbon emission goals in the fight against climate change and global warming.\nThe Company’s core competency is in deeply understanding and mastering the ‘local playbook’ of standard\noffer programs in numerous energy markets in North America allowing it to successfully gain market share\nwhile maintaining low overhead and capital-at-risk. The Company provides simple, reliable, and energy-\nresilient solutions to its customers that significantly reduce their carbon footprint. The Company has\nextensive experience working with 1,000+ customers including municipalities, First Nations, community\nco-operatives, regional economic planning authorities, commercial and industrial businesses, and\nlandowners that value the numerous benefits of resilient renewable energy solutions.\nThe Company’s leadership team has over 100 years of combined expertise in the renewable and clean\nenergy industry coupled with a strongly defined philosophy and financial vision for successful growth. The\nteam brings expertise in site origination, utility grid interconnection, permitting, financing, Engineering,\nProcurement and Construction (“EPC”), Operation & Maintenance, and asset management of solar PV\npower plants to the renewable and clean energy industry. As a total solution provider, the Company brings\ncertainty at speed and scale in site control, government relations, grid interconnection, global supply chain\nand project financing to bring grid-connected solar power plants to productive operation.\nThe Company focuses on grid connected solar PV electricity power plants, BESS and EV-Charging\nstations. With its full in-house development, engineering and construction expertise, the Company’s\ncapabilities span the value chain from development, EPC, financing, and operating as an Independent Power\nProducer (“IPP”). The Company’s core business consists of:\n Development: The Company identifies, evaluates and secures control of suitable solar, BESS and\nother renewable development sites; obtains grid interconnection from utilities; acquires permits\nfrom government authorities; and engages solar energy subscribers and/or Power Purchase\nAgreement (“PPA”) clients as off-takers. A PPA, also referred to as an off-take agreement, is a\n13\ncontract between two parties, one which generates electricity (the seller) and one which is looking\nto purchase electricity (the buyer or off-taker). The PPA defines all of the commercial terms for the\nsale of electricity between the two parties, including when the project will begin commercial\noperation, schedule for delivery of electricity, penalties for under delivery, payment terms, and\ntermination. A PPA requires active management to reconcile monthly deliveries, penalties and\npayment for electricity.\n EPC: The Company engineers, procures and constructs safe, efficient, eco-friendly, solar and other\nrenewable power plants for industrial, commercial, community and utility electricity market, using\nhigh engineering standards and the latest technology.\n Financing: The Company secures sponsor equity, tax equity, long-term debt, and construction\nfinancing to deploy BESS, solar and other renewable power plants.\n Independent Power Producer: The Company commenced operating as an IPP since 2023.\nPreviously the Company was carrying out one of the core functions of an IPP as it operates and\nmaintains solar power plants for maximized production (O&M services described further below)\nand oversees solar power subscribers through two customer support centers in Boston and Chicago.\nThe Company manages PPA and off-take agreements as an asset manager.\n O&M stands for Operations and Maintenance. It refers to the set of activities, most of them\ntechnical in nature, which enable power plants to perform their task of producing energy at or above\nthe expected level of performance, in compliance with applicable regulations. It encompasses\nseveral ongoing maintenance processes along with the replacement and disabling of broken and\ndamaged system and structural components. O&M is essential to ensuring that BESS, solar and\nother renewable power plants sustain themselves for their expected system life. O&M consists of\nthree fundamental and principal functions:\n Preventative maintenance.\n Reactive maintenance: rapid identification, analysis, and resolution of issues and problems.\n Comprehensive and detailed monitoring and reporting with adequate and requisite\ntransparency.\nIn carrying out its O&M services, the Company’s service standards are set out in its O&M contracts.\nThese service standards have been developed over time based on experience and industry best\npractices. Referring to government agencies and industry associations such the National Renewable\nEnergy Laboratory in the United States and Solar Power Europe, the standards have been developed\nbased on industry experience, reliability, resilience and maximizing system output. Afterwards\nexperience in the field and the close monitoring of system performance has allowed the standards\nto develop as to adapt to site specific conditions and achieve the highest system output and up time\npossible. Some references used in the development of the Company’s service standards are as\nfollows: (i) Best Practices for Operation and Maintenance of Photovoltaic and Energy Storage\nSystems, 3rd Edition National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory,\nSunSpec Alliance, and (ii) the SunShot National Laboratory Multiyear Partnership PV O&M Best\nPractices Working Group Operations and Maintenance Best practices guidelines version 5.0 by\nSolar power Europe.\nThe Company generates revenues via a diverse portfolio of distributed and community solar projects across\nmultiple solar markets including projects with host off-takers, community solar, and net metering projects\nunder programs such as FIT, Value of Distributed Energy Resources (“VDER”), Net Metering Credit\nAgreements (“NMCAs”), and PPAs. The Company develops solar projects that sell electricity to\ncommercial, industrial, municipal, residential and utility off-takers.\n14\nSince incorporation, the Company’s team delivered value in Ontario’s FIT program with the completion of\nhundreds of projects, New York’s Community Solar Program, and an RFP issued by the Maryland\nDepartment of Transportation. As a developer, full-service EPC contractor, and asset O&M manager, the\nCompany has been successful in the renewable and clean energy industry working with 1,000 plus\nstakeholders including property owners, municipalities, indigenous people, co-operatives, electric utilities\nand regulatory agencies. The Company designed and constructed hundreds of solar power plants, including\nC&I rooftop installations and ground mount solar farms of varying scale. The Company’s management\nteam has developed, financed and built over 600 C&I projects in Ontario, Minnesota and New York.\nThrough its contracted customer care centers in Boston and Chicago the Company serves more than 10,000\nretail electricity customers as community solar subscribers.\nThe Company’s success in the solar energy market is a result of its creativity, innovation, and ability to\nthink outside of the box, in designing responses to the growing challenges facing the power industry. The\nCompany has managed over $100 million in project financing to-date and has access to low-cost\ndevelopment financing by collaborating with tax-advantaged investment funds seeking CRCE in Canada\nor federal ITCs in the United States. A tax advantaged investment fund is an investment fund that passes\nthrough tax credits to its investors providing investors with tax benefits that allow such funds to offer lower\nreturns to investors. This in turn means that the Company can access funding from such investment funds\nat a lower cost of capital. An example of a tax-advantaged investment fund is the Solar Flow Through Funds\nGroup. There is a risk that if tax credits are eliminated or reduced in the future that such investment funds\nwill have difficulty raising capital and as a result the Company may no longer have access to this form of\nfinancing.\n15\nThree-year history\nDevelopments for the Year Ended June 30, 2021\nOn August 1, 2020, the Company entered into a promissory note agreement of $248,081 (US$200,000)\nwith Central New York Enterprise Development Corporation (“CNY”) for a loan with a fixed interest rate\nof 5% per annum and principal and interest are payable on February 1, 2022.

The BESS Projects are known as 903, OZ-1\nand SFF 06 and are subject to the following agreements:\n(i) Engineering, Procurement & Construction Agreement dated October 3, 2023 between\n1000234763 Ontario Inc. and the Company for 903 Project (the “903 EPC Agreement”);\n(ii) Engineering, Procurement & Construction Agreement dated October 3, 2023 between\n1000234813 Ontario Inc. and the Company for OZ-1 Project (the “OZ-1 EPC Agreement”);\nand\n(iii) Engineering, Procurement & Construction Agreement dated October 3, 2023 between\n1000234763 Ontario Inc. and the Company for SFF 06 Project (the “SFF 06 EPC\nAgreement”).\nThe BESS Projects were awarded as part of a procurement process with the Ontario IESO known as “E-\nLT1”. Projects under the E-LT1 are expected to be operational no later than April 30, 2026, but the\nCompany intends to have them completed for operation by the summer of 2025. Each BESS Project is\nexpected to operate under a long term contract with guaranteed capacity payments from the IESO, provided\nall contract obligations are met. The Projects will also earn revenue from the energy and ancillary markets\nin Ontario. Each has a 4.74 MW discharge capacity with a four-hour duration using lithium-iron-phosphate\ntechnology. Lithium-iron-phosphate technology allows for the greatest number of charge/discharge cycles,\nmaking it the optimal selection for stationary energy storage systems.\nThe Company has entered into share purchase agreements (the “SPAs”) dated October 23, 2023 to acquire\ncontrol of two corporations that hold solar projects located in Ontario with a combined capacity of 2.5 MW\n(the “OFIT Projects”) for consideration of 278,875 common shares (the “OFIT Consideration Shares”)\nof the Company (the “OFIT Transaction”). The corporations OFIT GM Inc. and OFIT RT Inc. (the\n“Purchased Entities”) have been operating the OFIT Projects since 2017. The shares of the Purchased\nEntities are being acquired from N. Fine Investments Limited and Linden Power Inc. Pursuant to the terms\nof the OFIT SPAs, the Company will acquire 49.9% ownership of OFIT RT Inc. where Whitesand First\nNation owns the remaining shares of OFIT RT Inc. The Company will also acquire 49.9% ownership of\nOFIT GM Inc. where the Town of Kapuskasing owns the remaining shares of OFIT GM Inc. The closing\nof the OFIT Transaction is subject to certain customary conditions including the receipt of consents from\nlenders to the Purchased Entities, landlords for the leases of the solar sites and shareholders of the Purchased\nEntities. Dr. Richard Lu, the President & Chief Executive Officer and a director of the Company is\nindirectly a shareholder of the Purchased Entities and will indirectly receive one-third of the Consideration\nShares. As a result, the Transaction is considered a related party transaction.\nOutlook\nBuilding upon its solid core competencies in full-service development, the Company will deliver an\nintegrated growth solution that has the capacity to generate revenue and grow the business in different\nrevenue streams and that is discussed in this paragraph. For C&I end users, the Company will extend its\nexpertise in rooftop solar to behind-the-meter (“BTM”) solar and BESS projects, carports, and building-\nintegrated photovoltaics enabling large property management firms and C&I customers like Honeywell to\nachieve corporate Net-Zero commitments. The Company has been in negotiations with C&I customers to\nachieve this goal. The Company also intends to extend its success in FIT ground mount solar gardens and\nCommunity Solar farms to large Utility Scale solar farms with a targeted size of 100 MWp or more. In this\nregard, the Company has site control of a potential 30 MWp utility solar project and is actively searching\nfor suitable sites that could allow for a utility size solar or other renewable energy project. The Company’s\ntrack record in operations, maintenance, and asset management create a strong foundation for it to become\n20\na successful IPP delivering long-term, sustainable, and profitable growth. The Company’s pipeline has been\ngrowing in all aspects of what is being discussed above which is the result of an integrated growth solution.\nTo achieve this strategic growth goal, the Company will strengthen its team of professionals to increase\nvolume. In 2022 and 2023 it added additional employees with professional credentials in engineering and\naccounting. An existing team of 12 professionals with experienced and committed core members will be\nsupplemented by outsourcing certain EPC services to meet a growing volume of business as the Company\nexpects to complete projects with more total MWp in the current fiscal year than were completed in the\nfiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The Company will continue its tradition in project execution with\nsimplicity, focus, and speed to enhance its leading position in cost competitiveness, with time to COD as a\nkey measure of operation excellence.\nNARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS\nSummary of the Business\nIndustry Overview\nPeople need energy for nearly everything they do. The majority of the energy sources on earth are still coal\nand natural gas, representing close to 60% of global electricity supply.1 However, fossil fuel reserves are\nlimited.\nConversely, the sun has all the energy our civilization needs. About 173,000,000 GW of Solar energy\ncontinue to reach the Earth’s surface.2 The US Department of Energy revealed that about 430 quintillion\nJoules (1.19e+14 kWh) of solar energy strikes the earth every hour.3 A single hour of solar energy could\nprovide enough energy to power the planet for a year. Unlike conventional energy sources, it will take 5\nbillion years for the sun to run out of fuel.4\n93% of the global population lives in countries that have an average daily solar PV potential between 3.0\nand 5.0 kWh/kWp.5 Because of this abundance of solar power, we only need a small percentage of the\nplanet’s surface to harvest enough energy to power the planet. For example, in Ethiopia just 0.005% of the\ncountry’s land area could generate sufficient power to cover existing needs, and in Mexico that figure is\njust 0.1%.6\nSolar PV potential varies across Canada, with the highest insolation in southern Saskatchewan, Alberta,\nManitoba, and Ontario, and the lowest in northern and coastal regions.7 The National Energy Board of\nCanada expects that by 2040, solar power will generate 13% of the country’s electricity.8\nSolar power is more affordable, accessible, and prevalent in the United States than ever before. From just\n0.34 GW in 2008, U.S. solar power capacity has grown to an estimated 97.2 GW today.9 This is enough to\npower the equivalent of 18 million American homes at average consumption.10 Today, over only a small\n1 International Energy Agency.

The Company\nprovides solar energy solutions by developing, permitting, designing and building BTM solar power\ngeneration and transmission or distribution electricity grid connected community solar gardens and utility\nscale solar farms. While the Company’s focus is on delivering solar power plants from site origination to\ncommercial operation, and the operation and management of the solar power assets, the Company also\nprovides renewable and clean energy project development, EPC, O&M and asset management services for\na fee.\n23\nA description of the Company’s three focus areas: BTM solar power generation, community solar and\nutility scale solar farms are as follows:\nBehind-the-Meter (BTM) Solar Power Generation\nThe most effective method to achieve Net-Zero carbon emissions from buildings is to build them all electric,\nwith grid electricity coming from renewable sources such as solar and wind (long-term) and BTM power\nplants (solar or BESS) to provide zero emission renewable solar power onsite for the building’s self-use\n(immediate).\nThe term “behind-the-meter” refers to energy production and storage systems that directly supply C&I\nbuildings with electricity. Commercial and Industrial solar panels are considered to be behind-the-meter,\nas are C&I BESS —the energy that is produced or stored by these systems is separate from the grid and\ndoes not need to be counted by a meter before being used, so they are positioned behind the meter. Behind-\nthe-meter, however, is not the same as “off-grid”. Most behind-the-meter energy systems are still grid-tied,\nwhich means they maintain a connection to the electrical grid. The energy the solar PV systems provide do\nnot pass through an electricity meter before it is used by a C&I business, but, when the panels are not in\nuse (when there is no sunlight), energy from the grid is sent to the C&I business, and that energy must pass\nthrough a meter first so that it can be accounted for by the utility.\nAll electricity end customers sit behind the meter. A BTM solar power plant can be net metered, through\nwhich the excess solar energy produced by the plant can be sent back to the grid in return for a credit or\nmoney from the local utility. BTM solar power plants have the following benefits:\n Energy cost savings,\n Control over project operations and maintenance,\n Self-consumption of distributed generation (usually solar PV),\n Visible commitment to sustainability (with solar PV), and\n Resiliency (with battery storage).\nAll provinces and territories in Canada offer net metering program though the details may differ.12 Forty-\none States in the US, in addition to Washington, D.C., American Samoa, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto\n12 Alberta: https://www.epcor.com/products-services/power/micro-generation/Pages/net-metering.aspx; British Columbia:\nhttps://app.bchydro.com/accounts-billing/electrical-connections/net-metering.html; Saskatchewan: https://www.saskpower.com/Our-Power-\nFuture/Powering-2030/Generating-Power-as-an-Individual/Using-the-Power-You-Make/Net-Metering; Manitoba:\n24\nRico offer net metering programs.13 The BTM solar projects are reasonable in size (average 300 kWp) as\nrooftop, carport or ground mount systems, and could be profitable with a targeted 15% gross margin. The\nCompany can be a turn-key service provider to commercial and industrial (“C&I”) customers for them to\nown BTM solar power plants on-site. The Company can also invest and own the BTM solar projects where\nlocal policies allow commercial aggregation and third party ownership.\nThere has been an increased interest in BTM solar projects and BESS. Existing buildings are responsible\nfor 18% of Canada’s GHG emissions, BTM solar power generation provides a readily available solution\ntoward the goal of Net-Zero by 2050.14\nCommunity Solar & BESS\nSolar power can help reduce CO emissions mainly by being a clean and renewable source of electricity.\n2\nSolar power is not dependent on burning fossil fuels or other products; instead, it uses electrons captured\nfrom the sun’s energy for electricity creation. Therefore, solar energy does not create greenhouse gases for\nenergy production at residential or C&I subscribers’ locations. Community Solar farms provide\nopportunities for the subscribers to do their part in achieving the Net-Zero goal.\nCommunity solar is a group of solar panels with access to the local electricity grid. Once the panels are\nturned on and generating electricity, clean energy from the site feeds into the local power grid. Depending\non the size and number of panels the project has, dozens or even hundreds of renters and homeowners can\nsave money from the electricity that is generated by the project. By subscribing to a project, a homeowner\nearns credits on their electric bill every month from their portion of the solar that’s generated by the project,\naccessing the benefits of solar without installing panels on their home.\nCommunity solar projects are usually 3 – 7 MWp each in size (see below a Company developed 3 MWp\nsolar farm in Portland, NY, USA) subject to State regulation. Community solar capacity has increased\nbecause more projects have come online and because projects have generally become larger over time.\nEconomies of scale enable cost-effective construction of a renewable energy system at a site with optimal\nrenewable resource availability.\nhttps://www.hydro.mb.ca/accounts_and_services/generating_your_own_electricity/?_ga=2.88824211.949710914.1666383471-\n1665874008.1666383471; Ontario: https://www.hydroone.com/business-services/generators/net-metering; Quebec:\nhttp://www.hydroquebec.com/residential/customer-space/account-and-billing/understanding-bill/residential-rates/net-metering-option.html; PEI:\nhttps://www.maritimeelectric.com/services/articles/net-metering/; Nova Scotia: https://energy.novascotia.ca/renewables/programs-and-\nprojects/enhanced-net-metering; New Brunswick: https://www.nbpower.com/en/products-services/net-metering/; Newfoundland:\nhttps://www.newfoundlandpower.com/My-Account/Usage/Electricity-Rates/Net-Metering; Yukon: https://yukon.ca/en/micro-generation-\nprogram; Northwest Territories: https://www.inf.gov.nt.ca/en/NetMetering; Nunavut: https://www.qec.nu.ca/customer-care/generating-power/net-\nmetering-program.\n13 National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Green Buildings. https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/green-buildings/24572\n25\nCommunity solar farm projects leverage economies of scale and often offer quick to market solutions for\nscales of approximately 1,000 homes/7 MWp. Additional advantages include, shared transaction costs often\nmake this procurement option less expensive than self-supply, and customers are generally not responsible\nfor maintenance and upkeep.\nUtility Scale Solar & BESS\nA utility-scale solar farm is one which generates solar power and feeds it into the grid, supplying a customer\nwith renewable solar energy. A ‘utility-scale’ solar project is usually defined as such if it is 10 MW or\nbigger in capacity of energy production. For comparison, the average American household uses\napproximately 900 kWh. A utility-scale solar power plant can utilize several solar technologies including\nprimary PV, tracking (rotate to track the sun’s movement) or fixed racking (does not track the sun’s\nmovement).\nWhat distinguishes utility-scale solar from distributed generation is both project size and the fact that the\nelectricity is sold to wholesale energy buyers, not end-use consumers. Virtually every utility-scale solar\nfacility has a PPA with a corporation, an IPP or a utility, guaranteeing a market for its energy for a fixed\nterm of time. Utility scale systems also participate in monthly and spot auction markets for energy, capacity,\nand ancillary services.\nUtility-scale solar has become a growing source of electricity in the world. Many utility-scale solar designs\ncan also include energy storage capacity that provides power when the sun is not shining and increases grid\nreliability and resiliency.\nTo reach NZ2050, every industry requires power and every business needs to decarbonize. Many companies\nwill need to partner with solutions providers such as the Company to help put them on a net-zero trajectory,\nand utility scale solar farm is a commercially viable decarbonization solution for reaching the Net-Zero\ncarbon emission goal.\nCustomers and Sales Channels\nThe pursuit of Net-Zero carbon emissions comes a rising demand for renewable energy. Customers are\nincreasingly capitalizing on the climate benefits of renewables; they are looking for renewable energy to\nmeet rising energy needs; they want to benefit from the improving economics of renewable energy via\nsubsidies; and they want to move their businesses away from fossil fuel dependency. Based on application,\nthe Company has customers in the following market segments: BTM, Community Solar, Corporate PPA,\nand Utility PPA.\n26\nBehind the Meter (BTM) Solar for C&I Customers\nCorporate Net-Zero goals boost BTM solar growth. The C&I BTM solar market, which consists of on-site\nsolar power generation primarily for self use has grown rapidly in recent years. Net-Zero adoption by\nbusinesses, non-for-profits and governments will help continue to increase the demand for BTM solar\nsegments. Many C&I customers are becoming more interested in making sustainability-focused choices.\nWith little more than 1% of commercial electricity demand served by on-site solar, there remains significant\nopportunity for growth in the BTM solar segment.\nAll subnational jurisdictions in Canada and the United States have net metering programs for BTM solar\nprojects.15 The Company delivers BTM projects to C&I customers with in-house expertise, enabling\neconomic progress on Net-Zero goals. A residential BTM market segment also exists; however, the\nCompany sees Community Solar as its strongest opportunity to serve mass market residential customers.\n15 See notes 12 and 13.\n27\nCommunity Solar for Mass Market Subscribers\nA Community solar subscription is tied to an offsite solar farm, or solar garden and allows homeowners,\nrenters, small businesses, religious organizations, and other not-for-profits to purchase solar energy without\nthe need to install panels on their property. Rather than purchasing energy solely sourced from utility-scale\ngenerators, such as coal and natural gas power plants, some or all electricity is sourced from the community\nsolar project. Subscribers are billed for the solar energy and are credited on their utility bill. In many cases,\nthis creates a discount over conventional electricity purchases. Community solar is especially appealing to\nthose customers who are unable or unwilling to install a renewable energy generator at their residence or\ncommercial facility but still seek the economic and environmental benefits of solar energy.\nAs of December 2021, Community solar projects are located in 39 states, plus Washington, D.C. 22 states,\nplus Washington, D.C., have policies that support community solar. Community solar projects represent\nmore than 3,200 MWac of total installed capacity.16 The Biden Administration wants community solar to\nreach 5 million households by 2025 and create $1 billion in energy bill savings.17\nCommunity Choice Aggregation (“CCA”) is an alternative to the investor-owned utility energy supply\nsystem in which local entities in the United States aggregate the buying power of individual customers\nwithin a defined jurisdiction to secure an alternative energy supply contract. The CCA chooses the power\ngeneration source on behalf of the consumers; and thus have the potential to be a major source of viable\ncustomers for community solar projects, representing very large contracts for community solar generators.\nThe main goals of CCAs have been to either lower costs for consumers or to allow consumers greater\ncontrol of their energy mix, mainly by offering cleaner generation portfolios than many local utilities.\nSeven states in the United States have enacted CCA-enabling laws.18 CCAs have set national green power\nand climate protection records while reducing power bills. CCAs have won National Renewable Energy\nLaboratory and Environmental Protection Agency recognition for supplying significantly higher amounts\nof renewable energy while maintaining rates that are competitive with conventional fossil fuel and nuclear-\nbased utility power. 19 CCAs are therefore already conspicuous leaders in green power innovation,\nreceiving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “green power leadership awards” for achievements\nin renewable energy. The Company has existing intends to in the future establish relationships with CCAs\nas a primary method of entry into the Community Solar project market.\nCorporate America and IPP Customers\nRegulation, investor activism, and rising consumer interest are among the factors pushing companies to\nbenchmark and improve the sustainability performance of their offerings. Both governments and consumers\nare demanding companies reduce emissions and their environmental footprint. As a result, a growing\ndemand exists for renewable electricity generation from large corporations. Globally, thousands of\ncompanies have set or are in the process of setting commitments to emissions reduction. In addition,\nhundreds of large US-based companies have committed to net-zero targets, many of which have set\nambitious emissions reductions targets by 2030 or sooner.\nSolar PPAs continue to evolve, with corporations increasingly procuring solar generation offsite. Major\ncustomers include renewable investment funds, RE100 corporations, and government administrations.\nCorporate solar PPAs can be classified as follows:\n16 National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

A\nFinancial PPA does not include the electricity delivery to the buyer, and so the buyer can be located\nin a different power market. A Financial PPA involves crediting the consumer for the generator’s\nproduction.\nCorporate solar PPA prices vary widely from state to state. From 2020 to 2021, there were reductions in\nlevelized electricity costs for commercial and utility-scale PV plus-storage systems. The levelized cost of\nelectricity of utility-scale stand-alone PV fell from 4.6 cents/kWh in Q1 2020 to 4.1 cents/kWh in Q1\n2021.20 State-by-state variance in contract prices is a function of avoided cost, resource availability and\nstate incentives. PPA rates continue to decline, increasing viability and market opportunity in more\njurisdictions. Falling component and build costs and attractive financing make solar the lowest-cost\ngeneration alternative in many states. Corporate customers are also negotiating shorter PPA terms to\nmaximize future flexibility.\nTraditional Energy Utilities as Customers\nFor the United States, the path to NZ2050 entails a comprehensive and rapid effort to decarbonize the\neconomy. America’s annual GHG emissions come from a variety of sources, spanning every sector.\nDemand from utilities for renewable energy is expected to continue to grow in line with the broader\neconomy. Utilities form the largest share of demand globally, particularly in the Americas, as they are\nrequired by law to meet RPS. They also have increased exposure to the merchant market (non-PPA), which\nwill start to account for a larger share of solar PV installations.\nCustomers Buy Solar Renewable Energy Certificate (“REC”) Off-Sets\nOne way that the decarbonization effort is being pursued by lawmakers is the creation of RPS at the\nsubnational level. An RPS makes it law for utilities to source a certain percentage of the electricity they sell\nto customers from renewable energy sources. This is done via REC trading systems.\nTo facilitate compliance with RPS requirements, states have adopted a market-based system of tradable\nRECs that represent the legal property rights to the environmental benefits of one MWh of renewable\nelectricity generation. A REC is issued for every MWh of electricity generated and delivered to the electric\ngrid from a renewable energy resource.\nIn the REC state markets, various RPS regimes require electricity suppliers to secure a portion of their\nelectricity from renewable power plants. Utilities must generate RECs themselves via self-owned renewable\ngeneration, purchase them from renewable generators, or else pay a penalty that is generally higher than\nthe market rate for RECs.\nAll green power supply options involve the generation and retirement of RECs. Renewable energy\nproviders can unbundle energy from RECs - selling energy as “brown” power and the RECs on the open\nmarket. REC sales involve no physical delivery of electricity to customers. One way to think of RECs is\nthat they represent the “solar” aspect of the electricity that was produced.\nREC generation and sales are a key revenue stream for utility-scale renewable projects owned by IPPs. In\nmany cases, it is the value of RECs that make these large projects financially viable. REC markets vary by\nstate in line with RPS requirements. As governments more aggressively pursue their carbon emissions\n20 Vignesh Ramasamy, David Feldman, Jal Desai, and Robert Margolis. U.S. Solar Photovoltaic System and Energy Storage Cost Benchmarks:\nQ1 2021, https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/80694.pdf\n29\ntargets in the lead up to 2030 and 2050, the Company expects RPS requirements to escalate accordingly\nand REC prices to increase.\nOperations Process\nLeveraging the Company’s development expertise means that it can finish turnkey solar projects in an\nefficient and timely manner. The Company’s process has five phases: Site Origination; Development;\nFinancing; Engineering, Procurement and Construction; Operation & Maintenance and Asset Management.\nThis process has been tested and verified and has brought the Company success.\nPhase 1 - Site Origination to Bankable Lease\n Policy analysis: Political analysis, environmental, permitting, land use.\n Prioritize low-cost interconnection sites.\n Financial analysis: Incentive framework, IRR analysis and relevant investment threshold.\n Site control: identification, evaluation and execute bankable lease to grow its greenfield Pipeline\nwith efficient site acquisitions, affordable land with low property tax rates.\n Acquisition of development pipelines.\nPhase 2 - Development to Notice To Proceed (NTP)\n Evaluate and prioritize projects with the highest likelihood of success.\n Grid interconnection studies: detailed discussions with the electrical utilities to determine the most\neconomical methods of connecting the projects to the electrical grid, could result in Connection\nImpact Assessments, Connection Cost Assessments, Connection Agreements.\n Permitting: municipal, state and/or federal permits and approvals, site plan optimization and\napproval, multiple approvals from zoning, planning and town boards and city council are required\ndepending on the type and size of the project. Projects may also involve a county level review.\n Environmental and required regulatory permits to ensure that the project will not significantly\nnegatively impact the surrounding natural environment.\n Incentives and PILOT/Tax.\n PPA rates, off-taker credit, post-contract assumptions.\nPhase 3 - Financing\n Sponsor equity: Draw on sponsor equity commitments from family office and other investors.\n Investment tax credit: Source tax equity from providers.\n Long-term debt: Opportunistically add project-level debt or bank leverage to maximize returns.\n Construction Financing: project cost and budgeting.\n30\nPhase 4 - Delivery: Engineering, Procurement and Construction to COD/PTO\n EPC selection and negotiation, vet EPC partners based on experience and track record, run targeted\nRFPs with firms that the company has a close relationship with.\n Further fieldwork such as geotechnical investigation, legal or topographical surveys, and site\nassessments.\n Electrical, civil, mechanical and structural engineering design, including erosion and sediment\ncontrol plan, Issue For Construction drawings.\n Construction permits such as building permits and entrance and address permits.\n Procurement: supplier negotiation on price and on-time delivery to the sites (solar panels, racking,\ninverter and BOS), procurement of electrical equipment is a critical step done as soon as the\nengineering phase has finalized its design. Some equipment such as transformers can take up to 16\nweeks of lead time for delivery.\n Work closely with local utilities and EPC firms to streamline the construction process.\n Contracting: installers contracting.\n Fencing and Safety: Fencing of the project site, coordinating with existing facilities and preparing\nsafety measures.\n Construction control: on budget, on schedule, regular site visits, QA/QC, PO and change order\nmanagement.\n System commissioning, coordination of all jurisdictional inspections and approvals, identification\nand correction of deficiencies, site commissioning inspections and tests must be passed. These\ninclude electrical commissioning and creation of as-built drawings and finalized package, and\nCOD/PTO.\n Site permits closing, site cleanup, landscaping, financial closing support, and coordinating with the\nutility to receive a final acceptance letter.\nPhase 5 - O&M, Subscriber Management, and Asset Management\n Project handover, acceptance, and O&M for high production.\n 100% subscription, 100% credit allocation, and utility reconciliation.\n Asset management: contract management, financial reporting, regulatory filings.\nEmployees, Specialized Skill and Knowledge\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company has 15 employees and an additional two contracted service providers.\nThe operations of the Company are managed by its directors and officers.\nThe nature of the Company’s business requires specialized knowledge and technical skill around\nprocurement, construction, management, financing and regulations of the solar industry. The required skills\nand knowledge to succeed in this industry are available to the Company through certain members of the\nCompany’s management, directors, officers, and advisory teams. The Company’s employees and\nconsultants have extensive experience working with municipalities, First Nations, community co-\n31\noperatives, regional planning authorities, commercial businesses, and landowners that value the numerous\nbenefits of resilient renewable energy solutions. The Company’s team also has extensive experience\ndeveloping, financing, building, permitting, commissioning, operating and maintaining renewable and\nclean power plants in Canada and the US with collectively over 100 years of direct experience profitably\noriginating and executing on projects. Many members of the team have a long track record working together\nat major North American renewable energy companies such as Potentia, Solar Power Networks, Sky Solar\nand ARISE Technologies. Most of the team built its track record developing, financing, conducting EPC\nand O&M, executing both ground mount and rooftop FIT solar projects in Canada and in the US. See\n“Directors and Executive Officers”.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe global solar market remains highly fragmented. Fragmentation will continue as barriers to entry remain\nlow for residential, community, commercial, and industrial applications and annual installations continue\nto grow driven by Net-Zero policy initiatives. As a result, the Company predicts significant price\ncompetition among solar power competitors.\nThe Company competes with peers in development, EPC, O&M, and IPP Asset Management. Solar\ncompanies are not disrupting or undermining the solar energy industry by selling new products or services\nthat may replace the Company’s. The Company competes on cost and volume via operational excellence.\nCertain companies in the segment could be vulnerable due to limited scope. The Company addresses this\nthrough exposure to the whole renewable energy value chain. Scale may hinder an operator’s ability to meet\nincreasing market demand. Successful solar companies in the Company’s segment are successful because\nof their ability to access capital markets to fund volume.\nSolar Developers\nA solar developer is a company that shepherds a solar power plant from ideation to construction readiness,\nalso known as Notice to Proceed (“NTP”) A developer can employ just a few employees or up to thousands.\nSome developers specialize in certain sizes of projects or in specific regions.\nThe process of developing a solar power plant can take years. Developers must secure a project site, find\nan customer for the electricity the power plant will produce (a utility, an electric cooperative in rural areas,\na corporation that wants the energy for its own use, or community solar subscribers); conduct technical,\ngeological and other studies on the land, study how the energy generated by the power plant will be\nconnected to the electric grid; apply for a variety of permits from local, state, and sometimes federal\nagencies; secure financing for the construction of the solar power plant; negotiate equipment purchases;\nand contract with an EPC firm for the build. All of this must happen before construction begins.\nCompetitors in solar development in markets relevant to the Company are presented in the table below,\nwith information from Solar Power World. The number one developer in Utah (UT), AES Clean Energy\nhas delivered 526MW utility scale solar in 2020; Nexamp in Massachusetts’ (MA) C&I market delivered\n128MW; and Enerlogics in Ohio’s (OH) C&I market delivered 1MW. The Company delivered 12MW in\n2020 with more than 100MW delivered since the Company’s founding. The Company could be ranked\nwithin the top 20 solar developers on this list.\n32\nSolar EPC Companies\nSolar EPC companies provide engineering, procurement, and construction of a full solar system. A solar\nEPC company is more sophisticated and holistic in the products and services they provide compared to a\ntypical solar installer. These include:\n Site surveys for project viability.\n Determine power generation capacity and equipment selection.\n Design and install of the PV system.\n Electric grid interconnection and metering.\n Facilitate financing including tax incentives and rebates.\n Commission the solar system to meet the designed production requirement.\nA list of competitors in the Company’s solar EPC segment is presented in the table below based on\ninformation from Solar Power World. The number one solar contractor is SOLVE Energy from California\n(CA), which installed 8.7 GW with 901 employees since founding. The last one in the table, Renewable\nEnergy Outfitters in Colorado (CO), delivered 593 kW with only 3 employees. The Company has installed\nmore than 100MW since its founding.\n33\nSolar O&M Service Providers\nMany of the large IPPs that own utility-scale solar PV portfolios in the U.S. rely on the plant developer or\nEPC firm for operations and maintenance, except for those that develop their own projects. Greentech\nMedia (GTM) Research’s O&M and asset management report identified the top 5 O&M providers\nmanaging U.S. utility-scale PV plants in the table below. One of the firms, Sempra, is also an IPP.\nAsset Management service – an IPP World\nGTM Research defines asset management as the ongoing management of financial, commercial, and\nadministrative tasks that are necessary to ensure the financial performance of a solar PV plant or a portfolio\nof plants. GTM Research and SoliChamba Consulting recently released a report, ‘Megawatt-Scale PV\nO&M and Asset Management 2016-2021’ which features a list of asset managers of U.S. utility-scale PV\nplants. The table below identifies the top five players:\n34\nIPPs who own solar power plants and typically perform asset management in-house dominate the top of the\nrankings, and make up four of the top five utility-scale PV asset managers in the U.S (based on reporting\nby SoliChamba Consulting outlined above). Most IPPs and financial investors; however, only manage the\nassets they invest in. The market for third-party asset management services remains small in the U.S. and\nits growth is probably limited by the dominance of IPPs and large portfolio owners who tend to self-service.\nThe top third-party asset managers include project developers like Recurrent Energy and affiliated service\nproviders like Bay4 Energy Services and EDF Renewable Services, as well as independent service\nproviders like Radian Generation and CAMS.\nCompany Competitive Advantage\nThe Company has grown through participating in standard offering programs such as the Ontario Feed-In-\nTariff program and New York’s NYSERDA NY-Sun Community Solar Program and are developing more\nthan 70 Community solar projects in collaboration with Central New York Regional Planning and\nDevelopment Board in New York. It has a good track record in developing and building renewable and\nclean energy projects in Canada and the USA. The Company has succeeded at delivering value at non-\nutility solar projects as a developer and a full-service EPC contractor; however, it has been evaluating\nopportunities for more growth in solar project volumes. Becoming an IPP aiming at long-term sustainable\ninvestment returns is the Company’s natural next step. To meet the desire for growth, the Company has re-\npositioned itself to deliver integrated growth solutions that expands from developer to an IPP in the C&I,\nCommunity, and Utility solar PV and BESS market segments.\nThe Company’s competitive advantage lies in its people, processes and experience. The Company’s team\nis skilled in translating customer needs into value-add solutions. The Company’s solar power plant delivery\nprocess is safe, reliable and low cost; and the Company provides a customer experience that is simple and\nfocused with speed in implementation.\nThird Party Suppliers\nThe Company procures all plant components on the open market. The Company qualifies suppliers’\nproducts based on three factors: bankability, availability, and cost.\n35\nProduct is considered bankable if lenders are willing to finance it. Component bankability is a key factor in\nprojects being offered non-recourse debt financing by lenders. Products must also be available to meet\nconstruction schedules at a competitive price. Though China is the most cost-competitive location for the\nmanufacture of solar PV and BESS components, Chinese solar and BESS products still must be bankable\nand available in order to be procured for the Company’s solar power and BESS plants.\nBloomberg NEF has developed a tiering system for PV module products based on bankability, creating a\ntransparent differentiation between the hundreds of manufacturers of solar modules on the market. Tier 1\nsolar panels, such as those from Canadian Solar, ZNShine, and Jinko are built to higher standards and have\nthe strongest reputation within the solar industry for quality and service. These panels last longer and\nproduce more energy. Tier 1 manufacturers can be expected to honor product warranties. The Company\nprimarily sources Tier 1 panels.\nSolar panel mounts and racks are the equipment that secures solar panels in place. Racking is used to attach\nsolar panels to a rooftop, ground, or another surface. With proper installation, an effective mount secures\nthe solar panels against all weather conditions and ultimately protects the investment. Choosing the right\nracking system depends on the site, local climate, and installer preference (bankable, available, and low\ncost). Additional information on the Company’s key supplies are below:\n Fixed Ground Mounts: Fixed ground mounts have lower energy production when compared to\ntracking systems, however no moving parts means lower O&M costs, and installation and\nprocurement costs are lower. Fixed system suppliers, such as Schletter’s fixed tilt solar racking\nsystem, are also more bankable.\n Single-Axis and Dual-Axis Solar Tracker: Trackers increase the efficiency of solar systems by\nproviding more direct sunlight to the system, moving the solar panels from East to West (single-\naxis include solutions from RBI Solar and TerraSmart’s) or from East to West and from North to\nSouth (dual-axis). The additional mechanical complexity leads to higher O&M costs, and\nprocurement and installation costs are higher compared to fixed systems.\n Ballasted (Zero Penetration) Mounts: These systems are ideal for sites on roof membranes,\nlandfill caps and industrial brownfields. More space is required to avoid table to table shading, and\nprecast blocks have higher shipping costs and require heavy equipment to move around a site.\nGameChange Solar has both precast and pour-in-place ballast racking solutions.\n Solar Inverters: These are an integral part of every system. The Company has used many top\nbrands such as Huawei, SunGrow, and SMA. The inverters perform two key functions: DC to AC\nconversion; and Maximum Power Point tracking (“MPPT”), where the inverter dynamically\nselects the voltage and current combination for the highest power production.\n String Inverters: These have better MPPT capability per string for high production, shorter DC\nwires for lower power loss, and require special racking for the inverter for each string. In general,\nthese have a higher per Watt cost than central inverters.\n Central Inverter: Central inverters feature easy system design, installation and O&M trouble\nshooting. However, they represent a single point of failure for the whole system, with high DC\nwiring costs and high power loss due to voltage drop. In addition, partial shading and string\nmismatch drastically reduces power output.\nPricing and Marketing\nThe Company strives to ensure its operational excellence. In the pursuit of Net-Zero there is an increasing\nwillingness among customers to purchase renewable and clean energy such as solar power. Commercial\ncustomers are price sensitive in that they need to balance Net-Zero preferences and operational costs to\n36\nremain competitive in their core businesses. Like with all utility economics, regulatory policy is a primary\ndriver of revenue. Electricity prices are set largely by regulatory bodies like Public Service Commissions\nor Energy Boards. A PPA has to be equal to or lower than the regulated electricity price, in addition to\nproviding renewable energy credits. The Company and its competitors generally have the same electricity\nprice point (economic oligopoly). The Company gains economic value by managing project cost (the larger\nthe project, the lower cost per watt installed), and driving business volume through a portfolio approach\nwith large partners like Honeywell and large property management companies.\nThe Company prices its community and utility solar project and services competitively, and aligns itself\nwith market pricing forecasts. The Company prices BTM & BESS solar projects to offer the host C&I\ncustomers a lower electricity cost, while securing a required return to its investors. BTM project pricing\nworks the best in the Northeast USA where the retail electricity prices are high enough to enable a healthy\nmargin in every BTM project the Company does.\nWith respect to promotion and marketing to secure customers:\nSales Team\n The Company’s sales team must be highly trained, with a financial background, one on one selling\nskills, and should ideally hold a business credential.\n One dedicated sales manager per Province/State, with core team support from head office in order\nto support 50 MWp to 100 MWp annual growth rate at $150k total annual budget per person.\nMarketing Communications Plan with a promotion budget of 5% of gross revenue\n 20% on advertising (online & printed media).\n 80% public relations and investor relations.\nMessaging customers with key messages\n Community Solar Subscribers: Save on your utility bills while doing good to the environment.\n Community Choice Aggregation: Let the Company’s PPA be your way to cheaper, greener energy\nfor your community members.\n Major Corporations: Be the 1st Net-Zero corporation among your peers.\n Large Utilities: Your state RPS compliance is the Company’s business.\nRegulatory Environment\nAchieving Net-Zero by 2050 (“NZ2050”) is widely seen as the best way to halt climate change. “Net zero”\nmeans our total carbon dioxide emissions are equal to or less than the emissions we remove from the\nenvironment. NZ2050 will require new policies, investments, participation and commitment by\ngovernment, industry, and individuals. The most feasible pathways to net-zero emissions include four main\nstrategies:\n Generate emission-free electricity using sources like wind, solar, nuclear, and waterpower.\n Use vehicles and equipment that are powered by electricity instead of fossil fuels.\n Use energy more efficiently.\n37\n Remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nPolicymakers are increasingly recognizing that renewable energy is the key to net-zero. Governments must\nbuild frameworks and reform bureaucracies to level the playing field for renewables as, in many countries,\nthe bureaucracies still favour fossil fuels, giving the fossil fuel industry large subsidies. To date more than\n140 countries have now set or are considering a target of NZ2050.21 United Nations Secretary-General\nAntónio Guterres called on the world to “end fossil fuel pollution and accelerate the renewable energy\ntransition, before we incinerate our only home”.22\nFighting climate change is good business. Renewables such as wind and solar are readily available and in\nmost cases, are cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels. Solar and battery energy storage costs have\nplummeted in the past decade. Despite the headwinds presented by ongoing cost inflation and supply chain\nchallenges, demand for clean energy sources has never been higher, and the Company expects that the\nglobal energy crisis will continue to act as an accelerant for the clean energy transition.\nSince the International Energy Agency’s (“IEA”) last in-depth review in 2015, Canada has made a series\nof international and domestic commitments, putting it on a path toward achieving an ambitious energy\nsystem transformation and climate transition. The Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act, which\nbecame law on June 29, 2021, enshrines in legislation Canada’s commitment to achieve net-zero emissions\nby 2050. The majority of Canadians already depend on clean, reliable electricity to power their everyday\nlives. Canada has accelerated the phase-out of coal, implemented natural gas regulations and put a price on\ncarbon pollution. The Government will connect regions with clean power through Regional Strategic\nInitiatives.23 The Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act encourages the reduction of GHG emissions. The\nLiberal Party of Canada has signaled its intention to continue the annual price increases until the price on\nemissions reaches $170 per tonne of CO2e by 2030.24\n21 Climate Action Tracker.

The IRA includes long-term solar\nand energy storage tax incentives and other critical provisions that will help decarbonize the electric grid\nwith significant clean energy deployment. The legislation earmarks $369 billion for U.S. energy security\nand fighting climate change. It is expected to cut annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by about 1 billion\nmetric tons by 2030 mainly by speeding up the deployment of clean electricity and electric vehicles.25 The\nIRA extends the solar ITC by 10 years at 30%. The existing federal ITC has been fundamental to\nincentivizing the growth of American solar. The credit applies to residential, commercial, and utility-scale\ndevelopers and will create an effective discount of 30% on the capital cost of solar installations for ten years\n(until 2033). The credit will decline to 26% in 2033 and to 22% in 2034. The reinvigorated ITC will come\nwith a variety of “adders,” which could push the tax credit to as high as 50% for some projects. Additionally,\nthe credit is equipped with a direct pay provision, allowing developers with little to no tax liability to treat\nit as a tax overpayment, resulting in a cash refund.\nThe IRA also provides ITCs for Standalone Storage and Interconnection Upgrades. Until now, battery\nstorage was only eligible for the ITC if it was directly charged by solar. With respect to interconnection\nupgrades, a significant portion of the cost of solar projects is to pay for utilities to upgrade the grid so that\nthe solar project can connect to it. With the IRA, standalone storage and interconnection upgrades are\neligible for ITC.\n25 Jesse D. Jenkins, Erin N. Mayfield, Jamil Farbes, Ryan Jones, Neha Patankar, Qingyu Xu, and Greg Schivley. Preliminary Report: The\nClimate and Energy Impacts of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-09-\n21.pdf\n39\nTo promote a diversified resource mix and encourage deployment of renewable energy, most States have\nestablished RPS. The policies require that a specified percentage of the electricity sold by utilities comes\nfrom renewable resources. RPS policies help drive the United States market for wind, solar and other\nrenewable energy. Roughly half of the growth in U.S. renewable energy generation since the beginning of\nthe 2000s can be attributed to State renewable energy requirements.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the markets where it does\nbusiness. These laws and regulations include energy regulations, export and import restrictions, tax laws\nand regulations, environmental regulations, labor laws, supply chain laws and regulations and other\ngovernment requirements, approvals, permits and licenses. The Company also faces trade barriers and trade\nremedies such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses, including\nantidumping and countervailing duty orders, which could increase the prices of our supplies.\nIn the countries where we do business, the market for solar power, solar projects and solar electricity is\nheavily influenced by national, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric\nutility industry, as well as policies disseminated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often\nrelate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation. The\nCompany expects that our solar power projects and their installation will continue to be subject to national,\nstate and local regulations and policies relating to safety, utility interconnection and metering, construction,\nenvironmental protection, and other related matters. See “Risk Factors”.\nImpact of Environmental Laws and Regulations\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these\nregulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages, fines and the\nsuspension or even termination of the Company’s business operations.\nThe Company is required to comply with all national and local environmental regulations. The Company’s\nbusiness generates noise, wastewater and other industrial waste in our operations and the risk of incidents\nwith a potential environmental impact has increased as its business has expanded. The Company believes\nthat it substantially complies with all relevant environmental laws and regulations and has all necessary and\nmaterial environmental permits to conduct its business as it is presently conducted. However, if more\n40\nstringent regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of complying with these new regulations could be\nsubstantial. If the Company fails to comply with present or future environmental regulations, it may be\nrequired to pay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations.\nThe Company’s solar power projects must comply with the environmental regulations of the jurisdictions\nin which they are installed, and the Company may incur expenses to comply with such regulations. If\ncompliance is unduly expensive or unduly difficult, the Company may lose market share and its financial\nresults may be adversely affected. Any failure by the Company to control its use or to restrict adequately\nthe discharge, of hazardous substances could subject the Company to potentially significant monetary\ndamages, fines or suspensions of its business operations.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company is not dependent on intellectual property rights for its business. The Company has no\nregistered trademarks, patents or patent applications; however, the Company has applied in Canada and the\nUnited States to trademark the term “SOLARBANK”. The Company asserts copyright ownership generally\nin its written works, but has no formal copyright registration process in place.\nCycles\nThe Company’s business is subject to seasonal variations in demand linked to construction cycles and\nweather conditions. Demand for solar power and battery storage products and services from some markets,\nsuch as the U.S., may also be subject to significant seasonality due to adverse weather conditions that can\ncomplicate the installation of solar power systems and negatively impact the construction schedules of solar\nprojects. Seasonal variations could adversely affect our results of operations and make them more volatile\nand unpredictable.\nForeign Operations\nCurrently the Company’s only foreign operations are in the United States which are detailed above. The\nCompany intends to continue to focus on developing solar projects in Canada and the United States but will\nevaluate expanding into other countries based on the regulatory environment, demand and financial metrics\nof opportunities.\nEconomic Dependence\nThe Company’s business is not substantially dependent on any one contract for the products and services\nthat it provides or the sourcing of the materials, labour and supplies it requires to provide its services.\nHowever, each year it is limited to the number of projects that it can develop and therefore its material\ncontracts such as the Manlius EPC Agreement, Honeywell EPC Agreement and SFF EPC Agreement are\nthe current source of the majority of its expected revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. As a\nresult, the termination of either of these contracts would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s\nfinancial performance. See also “Risk Factors”.\nSocial or Environmental Policies\nThe Company has not yet implemented any formal social or environmental policies that are fundamental to\nits operations. It is currently evaluating the implementation of such policies based on current trends related\nto environment, social and governance initiatives.\nLending\nThe Company does not currently hold any investments or have lending operations and has not adopted any\nspecific policies or restrictions regarding investments or lending.\n41\nBankruptcy and Similar Procedures\nThere are no bankruptcies, receivership or similar proceedings against the Company, nor is the Company\naware of any such pending or threatened proceedings. There has not been any voluntary bankruptcy,\nreceivership or similar proceedings by the Company since its incorporation.\nReorganizations\nThere has not been any material reorganization of the Company or any of its subsidiaries within the three\nmost recently completed financial years or completed during or proposed for the current financial year.\nSignificant Acquisitions\nThe Company has made no significant acquisitions for which disclosure is required under Part 8 of National\nInstrument 51-102.\nRISK FACTORS\nDue to the nature of that business and the present stage of development of its business, the Company may\nbe subject to significant risks. The Company's actual operating results may be very different from those\nexpected as at the date of this AIF, in which the event the value or trading price (once listed) of the\nCompany’s Common Shares could decline and an investor may lose all or part of his or her investment.\nAll statements regarding the Company and the Company's business should be viewed in light of these risk\nfactors. Such information does not purport to be an exhaustive list. If any of the identified risks were to\nmaterialize, the Company's business, financial position, prospectus, anticipated operations, results and/or\nfuture operations may be materially affected (each a \"material adverse effect\"). Additional risks and\nuncertainties not presently known to the Company, or which the Company currently deems not to be\nmaterial, may also have a material adverse effect. References to “we” or “us” shall mean the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Industry\nThe Company may be adversely affected by volatile solar power market and industry conditions; in\nparticular, the demand for its services may decline, which may reduce its revenues and earnings.\nOur business is affected by conditions in the solar power market and industry. We believe that the solar\npower market and industry may from time to time experience oversupply. When this occurs, many solar\npower project developers and solar system installers, may be adversely affected.\nThe solar power market is still at a relatively early stage of development, and future demand for solar power\nproducts and services is uncertain. Market data for the solar power industry is not as readily available as\nfor more established industries, where trends are more reliably assessed from data gathered over a longer\nperiod of time. In addition, demand for solar power products and services in our largest end markets,\nincluding the U.S, may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate. Many factors may\naffect the viability of solar power technology and the demand for solar power products, including:\n the cost-effectiveness, performance and reliability of solar power products and services compared\nto conventional and other renewable energy sources and products and services;\n the availability of government incentives to support the development of the solar power industry;\n the availability and cost of capital, including long-term debt and tax equity, for solar projects;\n the success of other alternative energy technologies, such as wind power, hydroelectric power,\nclean hydrogen, geothermal power and biomass fuel;\n42\n fluctuations in economic and market conditions that affect the viability of conventional and other\nrenewable energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil, gas and other fossil\nfuels;\n capital expenditures by end users of solar power products and services, which tend to decrease\nwhen the economy slows; and\n the availability of favorable regulation for solar power within the electric power industry and the\nbroader energy industry.\nIf solar power technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for solar products\nand services does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate, our revenues may suffer and\nwe may be unable to sustain our profitability.\nThe execution of our growth strategy depends upon the continued availability of third-party financing\narrangements for us and our customers, which is affected by general economic conditions. Tight credit\nmarkets could depress demand or prices for solar power products and services, hamper our expansion\nand materially affect our results of operations.\nMost solar projects require financing for development and construction with a mixture of equity and third-\nparty funding. The cost of capital affects both the demand and price of solar power systems. A high cost of\ncapital may materially reduce the internal rate of return for solar projects.\nFurthermore, solar projects compete for capital with other forms of fixed income investments such as\ngovernment and corporate bonds. Some classes of investors compare the returns of solar projects with bond\nyields and expect a similar or higher internal rate of return, adjusted for risk and liquidity. Higher interest\nrates could increase the cost of existing funding and present an obstacle for future funding that would\notherwise spur the growth of the solar power industry. In addition, higher bond yields could result in\nincreased yield expectations for solar projects, which would result in lower system prices. In the event that\nsuitable funding is unavailable, our customers may be unable to pay for services they have agreed to\npurchase and we may be unable to develop our own solar power projects. It may also be difficult to collect\npayments from customers facing liquidity challenges due to either customer defaults or financial institution\ndefaults on project loans. Constricted credit markets may impede our expansion plans and materially and\nadversely affect our results of operations. The cash flow of a solar power project may be derived from\ngovernment-funded or government-backed Feed-In Tariffs (“FITs”). Consequently, the availability and\ncost of funding solar projects is determined in part based on the perceived sovereign credit risk of the\ncountry where a particular project is located.\nIn light of the uncertainty in the global credit and lending environment, we cannot make assurances that\nfinancial institutions will continue to offer funding to solar project developers at reasonable costs. An\nincrease in interest rates or a decrease in funding of capital projects within the global financial market could\nmake it difficult to fund solar power systems and potentially reduce the demand for solar projects, which\nmay materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur future success depends partly on our ability to expand the pipeline of our energy business in\nseveral key markets, which exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nHistorically, our provision of solar power project development services have accounted for the majority of\nour net revenues. While we plan to continue to monetize our current portfolio of solar projects in operation,\nwe also intend to grow our energy business by developing and selling or operating more solar projects,\nincluding those that we develop and those that we acquire from third parties. As we do, we will be\nincreasingly exposed to the risks associated with these activities. Further, our future success largely depends\non our ability to expand our solar project pipeline. The risks and uncertainties associated with our energy\nbusiness, and our ability to expand our solar project pipeline, include:\n43\n the uncertainty of being able to sell the projects, receive full payment for them upon completion,\nor receive payment in a timely manner;\n the need to raise significant additional funds to develop greenfield or purchase late stage solar\nprojects, which we may be unable to obtain on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control,\nincluding construction and procurement price inflation, delays in regulatory approvals, grid\nconnection, supply chain of our suppliers or availability of components, construction and\ninstallation, and customer acceptance testing;\n delays or denial of required regulatory approvals by relevant government authorities, as a result of,\namong others, poor management of permitting process, including lack or resources and opaqueness\nof administrative measures;\n diversion of significant management attention and other resources; and\n failure to execute our project pipeline expansion plan effectively.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our energy business, and, in particular, our solar project pipeline,\nwe may be unable to expand our business, maintain our competitive position, improve our profitability and\ngenerate cash flows.\nGovernments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for solar and\nbattery storage power, which could cause demand for our products to decline.\nHistorically, the market for on-grid applications, where solar power supplements the electricity a customer\npurchases from the utility network or sells to a utility under a FIT, depends largely on the availability and\nsize of government subsidy programs and economic incentives. Until recently, the cost of solar power\nexceeded retail electricity rates in many locations. Government incentives vary by geographic market.\nGovernments in many countries provided incentives in the form of FITs, rebates, tax credits, renewable\nportfolio standards, auctions for Contracts for Difference, Feed-in Premium and other incentives. These\ngovernments implemented mandates to end-users, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of\nsolar power products to promote the use of solar energy in on-grid applications and to reduce dependency\non other forms of energy. However, these government mandates and economic incentives in many markets\neither have been or are scheduled to be reduced or eliminated altogether, and it is likely that eventually\nincentives for solar and alternative energy technologies will be phased out completely. Over the past few\nyears, the cost of solar energy has declined, and the industry has become less dependent on government\nincentives. However, governments in some of our largest markets, including the United States, have\nexpressed their intention to continue supporting various forms of “green” energies, including solar power,\nas part of broader policies towards the reduction of carbon emissions. The governments in many of our\nlargest markets, including the United States, continue to provide incentives and policy support schemes for\ninvestments in solar power that will directly benefit the solar industry. We believe that the near-term growth\nof the market partially depends on the availability and size of such government incentives.\nWhile solar projects may continue to offer attractive internal rates of return, it is unlikely that these rates\nwill be as high as they were in the past. If internal rates of return fall below an acceptable rate for project\ninvestors, and governments continue to reduce or eliminate incentives for solar power, this may cause a\ndecrease in demand and considerable downward pressure on solar systems and therefore negatively impact\nthe value of solar projects. The reduction, modification or elimination of government incentives in one or\nmore of our markets could therefore materially and adversely affect the growth of such markets or result in\nincreased price competition, either of which could cause our revenues to decline and harm our financial\nresults.\nOperational risks associated with becoming an Independent Power Producer\nAs the Company is now an IPP, there are certain additional risks associated with the ownership and\noperation of solar power projects.\n44\nThe Company could fail to optimize operations at its facilities due to a shortfall in operational efficiency or\nresource optimization, or owing to inadequate maintenance plans or operation in extreme conditions. The\nCompany's facilities are subject to the risk of equipment failure due to deterioration of the asset resulting\nfrom wear and tear, age, hidden defects or design errors, or to extreme weather. The ability of solar power\nprojects to generate the maximum amount of power is a key determinant of the Company’s profitability. If\nthe solar power projects require longer downtime than expected for maintenance and repairs, or if power\nproduction is suspended for other reasons, it could adversely affect the Company’s profitability.\nFurthermore, the amount of power generated by the Company’s solar power projects is dependent on\nsunlight, which is naturally variable. Although the Company believes that past resource studies and\nproduction data collected demonstrate that the sites are economically viable, historical data and engineering\nforecasts may not accurately reflect the strength and consistency of resources in the future. If resources are\ninsufficient, the assumptions underlying the financial projections for the volume of electricity to be\nproduced by solar power projects might not materialize, which could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany's cash flows and profitability.\nThe Company’s ability to sell electricity is impacted by the availability of the various power transmission\nand distribution systems in each jurisdiction in which it operates. The failure of existing transmission or\ndistribution facilities or the lack of adequate transmission capacity would have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company’s ability to deliver electricity to its various counterparties, thereby adversely impacting the\nCompany’s operating results, financial position or prospects.\nThe ownership and operation of the Company’s solar power projects also carry an inherent risk of liability\nrelated to worker health and safety, including the risk of government-imposed orders to remedy unsafe\nconditions, of potential penalties for contravention of health and safety laws, licenses, permits and other\napprovals, and of potential civil liability for the Company. Compliance with health and safety laws (and\nany future changes to these laws) and the requirements of licenses, permits and other approvals will remain\nmaterial to the Company. In addition, the Company may become subject to government orders,\ninvestigations, inquiries or civil suits relating to health and safety matters. Potential penalties or other\nremediation orders could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of\noperations.\nGeneral global economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and\nresults of operations.\nThe demand for solar products and services is influenced by macroeconomic factors, such as global\neconomic conditions (e.g. interest rates, foreign exchange rates and inflation), demand for electricity,\nsupply and prices of other energy products, such as oil, coal and natural gas, as well as government\nregulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry, clean and other alternative energy industries\nand the environment. As a result of global economic conditions, some governments may implement\nmeasures that reduce the FITs and other incentives designed to benefit the solar industry. A decrease in\nsolar power tariffs or wholesale electricity in many markets placed downward pressure on the price of solar\npower in those and other markets. In addition, reductions in oil and coal prices may reduce the demand for\nand the prices of solar power products and services. Our growth and profitability depend on the demand for\nand the prices of solar power products and services. If we experience negative market and industry\nconditions and demand for solar power products and services weakens as a result, our business and results\nof operations may be adversely affected.\nOur project development and construction activities may not be successful, projects under development\nmay not receive required permits, property rights, EPC agreements, interconnection and transmission\narrangements, and financing or construction of projects may not commence or continue as scheduled,\n45\nall of which could increase our costs, delay or cancel a project, and have a material adverse effect on\nour revenue and profitability.\nThe development and construction of solar projects involve known and unknown risks, many of which are\nnot under our sole control. For example, we may be required to invest significant amounts of money for\nland and interconnection rights, preliminary engineering and permitting and may incur legal and other\nexpenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible; we may also need to engage and rely on\nthird parties including, but not limited to, contractors and consultants. Success in developing a particular\nproject is contingent upon, among other things:\n securing land rights and related permits, including satisfactory environmental assessments;\n receipt of required land use and construction permits and approvals;\n receipt of rights to interconnect to the electric grid;\n availability of transmission capacity, potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other\nsystem constraints;\n payment of interconnection and other deposits (some of which are non-refundable);\n negotiation of satisfactory EPC agreements;\n obtaining construction financing, including debt, equity and tax credits; and\n timely and satisfactory execution and performance by the third parties that we engage.\nIn addition, successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors,\nincluding:\n changes in laws, regulations and policies and shifts in trade barriers and remedies, especially tariffs;\n delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals;\n potential challenges from local residents, environmental organizations, and others who may not\nsupport the project;\n unforeseen engineering problems; subsurface land conditions; construction delays; cost over-runs;\nlabor, equipment and materials supply shortages or disruptions (including labor strikes);\n failure to enter into PPAs on terms favorable to us, or at all;\n additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign\njurisdictions, including compliance with applicable U.S. or local laws and customs; and\n force majeure events, including adverse weather conditions, pandemics, supply chain disruptions,\nhostilities and other events beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to complete the development of a solar project or we fail to meet any agreed upon system\nlevel capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties or other contract terms, or our projects cause grid\ninterference or other damage, the EPC, the PPA or other agreements related to the project may, depending\non the specific terms of the agreements, be terminated and/or we may be subject to significant damages,\npenalties and other obligations relating to the project, including obligations to repair, replace or supplement\nmaterials for the project.\nWe may enter into fixed-price EPC agreements in which we act as the general contractor for our customers\nin connection with the installation of their solar power projects. All essential costs are estimated at the time\nof entering into the EPC agreement for a particular project, and these costs are reflected in the overall fixed\nprice that we charge our customers for the project. These cost estimates are preliminary and may or may\nnot be covered by contracts between us and the subcontractors, suppliers and other parties involved in the\nproject. In addition, we require qualified, licensed subcontractors to install most of our solar power and\nbattery storage systems. Shortages of components (which may be attributable to the shortage of raw\nmaterials or components) or skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs.\nShould miscalculations in planning a project occur, including those due to unexpected increases in\ncommodity prices or labor costs, or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase the EPC sales\n46\nprice commensurately, we may not achieve our expected margins or our results of operations may be\nadversely affected.\nDeveloping and operating solar & BESS projects exposes us to various risks.\nThe development of solar and BESS projects can take many months or years to complete and may be\ndelayed for reasons beyond our control. It often requires us to make significant up-front payments for,\namong other things, land rights, interconnection work and permitting in advance of commencing\nconstruction, and revenue from these projects may not be recognized for several additional months\nfollowing contract signing. Any inability or significant delays in entering into sales contracts with\ncustomers after making such up-front payments could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations. Furthermore, we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other\nbusiness operations and invest in other projects.\nDeveloping solar and BESS projects requires significant management attention to negotiate the terms of\nour engagement and monitor the progress of the projects which may divert management’s attention from\nother matters. Our revenue and liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the market for solar projects\nweakens or we are not able to successfully complete the customer acceptance testing due to technical\ndifficulties, equipment failure, or adverse weather, and we are unable to sell our solar projects at prices and\non terms and timing that are acceptable to us.\nOur energy business also includes operating solar projects and selling electricity to the local or national\ngrid or other power purchasers. As a result, we are subject to a variety of risks associated with intense\nmarket competition, changing regulations and policies, insufficient demand for solar or power,\ntechnological advancements and the failure of our power generation facilities.\nWe face a number of risks involving PPAs and project-level financing arrangements, including failure\nor delay in entering into PPAs, defaults by counterparties and contingent contractual terms such as\nprice adjustment, termination, buy-out, acceleration and other clauses, all of which could materially\nand adversely affect our energy business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to enter into PPAs for our future solar projects due to intense competition, increased\nsupply of electricity from other sources, reduction in wholesale electricity prices, changes in government\npolicies or other factors. There is a limited pool of potential buyers for electricity generated by solar power\nplants since the transmission and distribution of electricity is either monopolized or highly concentrated in\nmost jurisdictions. The willingness of buyers to purchase electricity from an independent power producer\nmay be based on a number of factors and not solely on pricing and surety of supply. Failure to enter into\nPPAs on terms favorable to us, or at all, would negatively impact our revenue and our decisions regarding\nthe development of power plants. We may experience delays in entering into PPAs for some of our solar\nprojects or may not be able to replace an expiring PPA with a contract on equivalent terms and conditions,\nor otherwise at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. Any delay in entering\ninto PPAs may adversely affect our ability to finance project construction and to enjoy the cash flows\ngenerated by such projects. If we are unable to replace an expiring PPA with an acceptable new PPA, the\naffected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations, or could be exposed to more uncertain\nmerchant or wholesale electricity pricing, which could materially and adversely affect our financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSubstantially all of the electric power generated by our solar projects is expected to be sold under long-term\nPPAs with public utilities, licensed suppliers, corporate offtakers, and commercial, industrial or government\nend users. Despite possible future alternatives, we expect a substantial number of our future projects to also\nhave long-term PPAs or similar offtake arrangements such as FIT programs. If, for any reason, any of the\npurchasers of power under these contracts are unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual\nobligations, they refuse to accept delivery of the power delivered thereunder or they otherwise terminate\nthem prior to their expiration, our assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations and\n47\ncash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Further, to the extent any of our power purchasers\nare, or are controlled by, governmental entities, our facilities may be subject to legislative or other political\naction that may impair their contractual performance or contain contractual remedies that do not provide\nadequate compensation in the event of a counterparty default.\nPPAs may be subject to price adjustments over time. If the price under any of our PPAs is reduced below\na level that makes a project economically viable, our financial conditions, cash flow and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, certain of the projects that we may\nacquire in the future may allow, the lenders or investors to accelerate the repayment of the financing\narrangement in the event that the related PPA is terminated or if certain operating thresholds or performance\nmeasures are not achieved within specified time periods.\nWe are subject to numerous laws, regulations and policies at the national, regional and local levels of\ngovernment in the markets where we do business. Any changes to these laws, regulations and policies\nmay present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power and\nbattery storage products, solar projects and solar electricity, which may significantly reduce demand\nfor our products and services or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the markets where we do business, some of which\nmay conflict with each other and all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations include\nenergy regulations, export and import restrictions, tax laws and regulations, environmental regulations,\nlabor laws, supply chain laws and regulations and other government requirements, approvals, permits and\nlicenses. We also face trade barriers and trade remedies such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other\nrestrictions and expenses, including antidumping and countervailing duty orders, which could increase the\nprices of our supplies.\nIn the countries where we do business, the market for solar power, solar projects and solar electricity is\nheavily influenced by national, state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric\nutility industry, as well as policies disseminated by electric utilities. These regulations and policies often\nrelate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer-owned electricity generation, and\ncould deter further investment in the research and development of alternative energy sources as well as\ncustomer purchases of solar power and battery storage technology, which could result in a significant\nreduction in the potential demand for our solar power services, solar projects and solar electricity.\nWe expect that our solar power products and their installation will continue to be subject to national, state\nand local regulations and policies relating to safety, utility interconnection and metering, construction,\nenvironmental protection, and other related matters. Any new regulations or policies pertaining to solar\npower products may result in significant additional expenses to us and our customers, which could cause a\nsignificant reduction in demand for our solar power and battery storage products.\nIn our energy business, we are subject to numerous national, regional and local laws and regulations.\nChanges in applicable energy laws or regulations, or in the interpretations of these laws and regulations,\ncould result in increased compliance costs or the need for additional capital expenditures. If we fail to\ncomply with these requirements, we could also be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition\nof fines. Further, national, regional or local regulations and policies could be changed to provide for new\nrate programs that undermine the economic returns for both new and existing projects by charging\nadditional, non-negotiable fixed or demand charges or other fees or reductions in the number of projects\nallowed under net metering policies. National, regional or local government energy policies, law and\nregulation supporting the creation of organized merchant or wholesale electricity markets are currently, and\nmay continue to be, subject to challenges, modifications and restructuring proposals, which may result in\nlimitations on the commercial strategies available to us for the sale of our power.\nRegulatory changes in a jurisdiction where we are developing a solar project may make the continued\ndevelopment of the project infeasible or economically disadvantageous and any expenditure that we have\n48\npreviously made on the project may be wholly or partially written off. Any of these changes could\nsignificantly increase the regulatory related compliance and other expenses incurred by the projects and\ncould significantly reduce or entirely eliminate any potential revenues that can be generated by one or more\nof the projects or result in significant additional expenses to us, our offtakers and customers, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also face regulatory risks imposed by various transmission providers and operators, including regional\ntransmission operators and independent system operators, and their corresponding market rules. These\nregulations may contain provisions that limit access to the transmission grid or allocate scarce transmission\ncapacity in a particular manner, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (CFPOA), U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act of 1977, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §\n201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies\nand their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or\nindirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-\nsector recipients for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business in countries in which we conduct\nactivities. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies\nor state-owned or affiliated entities in the course of our business (for example, to obtain approvals, permits\nand licenses from applicable government authorities and to sell power to government-owned entities). We\nwould face significant liabilities if we failed to comply with these laws and we could be held liable for the\nillegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we did not\nauthorize such activities. Any violation of the CFPOA, FCPA or other applicable anticorruption laws could\nalso result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges,\nsevere criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operation, cash flows and reputation. In addition, responding to any enforcement action\nmay result in the diversion of management’s attention and resources, significant defense costs and other\nprofessional fees.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and evolving quickly, because many\nof our competitors have greater resources than we do or are more adaptive, and because we have a\nlimited track record in our energy business, we may not be able to compete successfully and we may\nnot be able to maintain or increase our market share.\nIn our energy business, we compete in a more diversified and complicated landscape since the commercial\nand regulatory environments for solar project development and operation vary significantly from region to\nregion and country to country. Our primary competitors are local and international developers and operators\nof solar projects. Some of our competitors may have advantages over us in terms of greater experience or\nresources in the operation, capital, financing, technical support and management of solar projects, in any\nparticular markets or in general. As the solar power and renewable energy industry grows and evolves, we\nwill also face new competitors who are not currently in the market. Our failure to adapt to changing market\nconditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors will limit our growth and will\nhave a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nAn anti-circumvention investigation could adversely affect us.\nOn August 16, 2021, a group of anonymous entities calling itself the American Solar Manufacturers Against\nChinese Circumvention (“A-SMACC”) requested that the U.S. Department of Commerce (“USDOC”)\ninitiate an anti-circumvention inquiry regarding crystalline silicon photovoltaic (“CSPV”) products from\nMalaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. A-SMACC alleged that certain CSPV products from Malaysia, Thailand,\nand Vietnam containing Chinese-origin components were circumventing the Solar 1 antidumping (“AD”)\nand countervailing duty (“CVD”) orders (i.e., CSPV solar cells manufactured in China). On November 10,\n2021, the USDOC rejected A-SMACC’s request and declined to initiate an anti-circumvention inquiry.\n49\nOn February 8, 2022, U.S. module producer Auxin Solar Inc. (“Auxin”) filed with the USDOC separate\ncircumvention petitions on CSPV products from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Canadian\nSolar entered these proceedings with respect to Thailand and Vietnam and requested that the USDOC reject\nAuxin’s petition. On April 1, 2022, the USDOC initiated anti-circumvention inquiries on a country-wide\nbasis with respect to all four countries.\nU.S. law provides that the USDOC may find that circumvention exists when (among other things)\nmerchandise subject to an AD/CVD order is completed or assembled in third countries with the end result\nof AD/CVD duty avoidance. Specifically, with respect to the existing Solar 1 China AD/CVD orders, the\nUSDOC may find that (i) certain CSPV cells and/or modules produced in Thailand and Vietnam fall within\nthe scope of the AD/CVD orders; and (ii) the collection of AD and/or CVD deposits is appropriate to\nprevent evasion of AD/CVD duties. The USDOC’s investigation will examine, inter alia, whether (i) the\nproduction process in Thailand and Vietnam is “minor or insignificant”; and (ii) the value of the\nmerchandise produced in China is a significant portion of the value of the product exported to the United\nStates. With respect to affirmative finding by the USDOC, imports of CSPV from Malaysia, Thailand and\nVietnam would essentially be treated as if they were of Chinese origin and subject to potentially very high\nAD/CVD deposit rates. This in turn would significantly increase the cost of CSPV products that are required\nfor our solar projects and risk significant harm to our financial condition and operations.\nMore recently, on June 6, 2022 the U.S. Federal Government declared a 24-month tariff moratorium on\nsolar panels manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam, by way of executive action by\nPresident Joe Biden. It remains possible that companies may be subject to tariffs after the 24-month period\nends; however, the moratorium reportedly will exempt U.S. companies from any retroactive tariffs.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate from period to period based on a number of factors, including:\n the timing of completion of construction of solar projects;\n the timing and pricing of our services;\n the availability and cost of solar cells and wafers from our suppliers;\n the availability and cost of raw materials;\n changes in government incentive programs and regulations, particularly in our key and target\nmarkets;\n the availability and cost of external financing for solar power applications;\n acquisition, investment and offering costs;\n geopolitical turmoil and natural disasters within any of the countries in which we operate;\n foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in United States and Canadian dollars;\n our ability to establish and expand customer relationships;\n fluctuations in electricity rates due to changes in fossil fuel prices or other factors;\n allowances for credit losses;\n impairment of property, plant and equipment;\n impairment of project assets;\n share-based compensation expenses on performance-based share awards under our share incentive\nplan;\n income taxes; and\n construction progress of solar projects and related revenue recognition.\nWe base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenues. A significant\nportion of our expenses will be fixed in the short-term. If our revenues for a particular quarter are lower\nthan we expect, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses proportionately, which would harm\nour operating results for the quarter. As a result, our results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to\nquarter and our interim and annual financial results may differ from our historical performance.\n50\nFluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our business, including our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nFluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars may result in\nforeign exchange gains or losses. Volatility in foreign exchange rates will hamper, to some extent, our\nability to plan our pricing strategy. To the extent that we are unable to pass along increased costs resulting\nfrom exchange rate fluctuations to our customers, our profitability may be adversely impacted. As a result,\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nA change in our effective tax rate can have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nA number of factors may adversely impact our future effective tax rates, such as the jurisdictions in which\nour profits are determined to be earned and taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities; adjustments to provisional taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; adjustments to the\ninterpretation of transfer pricing standards; changes in available tax credits; changes in stock-based\ncompensation expenses; changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws (e.g., in connection with\nfundamental U.S. international tax reform); changes in GAAP; and expiration of or the inability to renew\ntax rulings or tax holiday incentives. A change in our effective tax rate due to any of these factors may\nadversely influence our future results of operations.\nSeasonal variations in demand linked to construction cycles and weather conditions may influence our\nresults of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal variations in demand linked to construction cycles and weather\nconditions. Demand for solar power and battery storage products and services from some markets, such as\nthe U.S., may also be subject to significant seasonality due to adverse weather conditions that can\ncomplicate the installation of solar power systems and negatively impact the construction schedules of solar\nprojects. Seasonal variations could adversely affect our results of operations and make them more volatile\nand unpredictable.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows or have access to external financing necessary to\nfund planned operations and make adequate capital investments in solar project development.\nWe anticipate that our operating and capital expenditures requirements may increase. To develop new\nprojects, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain service standard quality, we\nmay need to make significant capital investments in facilities and capital equipment. We also anticipate that\nour operating costs may increase as we hire additional personnel, increase our sales and marketing efforts\nand invest in joint ventures and acquisitions.\nOur operations are capital intensive. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to extend existing\nor obtain new financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Also, we may not be able to raise\ncapital via public equity and debt issuances due to market conditions and other factors, many of which are\nbeyond our control. Our ability to obtain external financing is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n general market conditions for financing activities by solar power companies, including, but not\nlimited to interest rates; and\n economic, political and other conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding in a timely manner and on commercially acceptable terms, our growth\nprospects and future profitability may be adversely affected.\n51\nConstruction of our solar projects may require us to obtain financing for our projects, including through\nproject financing, green bond financing or others. If we are unable to obtain financing, or if financing is\nonly available on terms which are not acceptable to us, we may be unable to fully execute our business\nplan. In addition, we generally expect to sell our projects to tax-oriented, strategic industry and other\ninvestors. Such investors may not be available or may only have limited resources, in which case our ability\nto sell our projects may be hindered or delayed and our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient\ncash flows, find other sources of capital to fund our operations and solar projects, make adequate capital\ninvestments to remain competitive in terms of technology development and cost efficiency required by our\nprojects. If adequate funds and alternative resources are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to\nfund our operations, develop and construct solar projects, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures\nwould be significantly impaired. Our inability to do the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect\non our business and results of operations.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our\nfinancial health and our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our outstanding and future debt\nobligations.\nIn the ordinary course of developing solar projects, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the\nfuture, which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy\nour outstanding and future debt obligations. In the future, we may from time to time incur substantial\nadditional indebtedness and contingent liabilities and this could have important consequences to us and our\nshareholders. For example, it could:\n limit our ability to satisfy our debt obligations;\n increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;\n require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing and\nrepaying our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working\ncapital, capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;\n limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our businesses and the industry in\nwhich we operate;\n place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt;\n limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants of our indebtedness, among other\nthings, our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n increase the cost of additional financing.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating\nperformance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other\nfactors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate\nsufficient cash flow from operations to support the repayment of our indebtedness. If we are unable to\nservice our indebtedness, we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such\nas reducing or delaying capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness\nor seeking equity capital. These strategies may not be instituted on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition,\ncertain of our financing arrangements may impose operating and financial restrictions on our business,\nwhich may negatively affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business\nopportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund required capital expenditures, or\nwithstand a continuing or future downturn in our business. Any of these factors could materially and\nadversely affect our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\n52\nSupply chain issues, including shortages of adequate raw materials, component and equipment supply,\ncancellation or delay of purchase orders, inflationary pressures and cost escalation could adversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend mainly on third-party suppliers for raw materials and components, and we also procure certain\nequipment overseas. Our suppliers may not always be able to meet quantity requirements, or keep pace\nwith the price reductions or quality improvements, necessary for us to price products and projects\ncompetitively. Additionally, they may experience manufacturing delays and increased manufacturing cost\nthat could increase the lead time for deliveries or impose price increases.\nThe failure of a supplier, for whatever reason, to supply the materials, essential components and equipment\nthat meet quality, quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could impair our ability to develop\nprojects, increase costs, hinder compliance with supply agreements’ terms and may result, ultimately, in\ncancellation of projects and potential liability for us. The impact could be more severe if we are unable to\naccess alternative sources on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms and at prices that are\nprofitable. Supply may be interrupted by government mandates, accidents, disasters or other unforeseen\nevents beyond our control.\nPotential risks associated with acquisitions\nThe Company believes that the acquisitions recently completed and expected to be completed will have\nbenefits for the Company. However, it is possible that all or some of the anticipated benefits, including\nfinancial benefits and those that are the subject of forward-looking financial information, may not\nmaterialize, particularly within the time frame set by the Company's management. The realization of such\nbenefits may be affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company.\nIt is also possible that the Company did not detect in its due diligence during the completion of the\nacquisitions any liabilities and contingencies for which the Company may not be indemnified. Discovery\nof any material liability or contingency with respect to shares, assets or businesses acquired following such\nacquisitions could have a material adverse effect on the business acquired and the Company’s financial\nposition and operating results.\nLastly, the integration of assets acquired or to be acquired as part of the Company's acquisitions could pose\nsignificant challenges, and the Company's management may be unable to complete the integration or\nsucceed in doing so only by investing significant amounts of money. There can be no assurance that\nmanagement will be able to successfully integrate the assets acquired or expected to be acquired pursuant\nto these acquisitions or to realize the full benefits expected from the acquisitions.\nInflation in many countries and regions, especially in those where we operate, may adversely affect our\nbusiness and our profitability.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we have facilities and offices in Canada and the United States. We also acquire\nmaterials for solar power projects from overseas countries. As such, we are exposed to the inflation risks\ntherein. Recently, on a global basis, countries are experiencing high inflation rates. Inflation could increase\nthe costs of our supplies and labour costs. We may not be able to adjust the pricing of our PPAs or services\nsufficiently or take appropriate pricing actions to fully offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures,\nthus we may fail to maintain current levels of gross profit and operating, selling and distribution, general\nand administrative expenses and maintenance costs as a percentage of total net revenues. As such, rising\ninflation rates may negatively impact our profitability. In addition, a high inflation environment would also\nhave negative effects on the level of economic activity, employment and adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial conditions. For example, an increase in the inflation rates may result in\nan increase in market interest rates, which may require us to pay higher interest rates on debt securities that\nwe issue in the financial market from time to time to finance our operations and increase our interest\nexpenses.\n53\nWe may be subject to unexpected warranty expenses that may not be adequately covered by our\ninsurance policies.\nFor solar projects built by us, we also provide a limited workmanship or balance of system warranty against\ndefects in engineering, design, installation and construction under normal use, operation and service\nconditions. In resolving claims under the workmanship or balance of system warranty, we have the option\nof remedying through repair, refurbishment or replacement of equipment. We have also entered into similar\nworkmanship warranties with our suppliers to back up our warranties.\nAs part of our energy business, before commissioning solar projects, we conduct performance testing to\nconfirm that the projects meet the operational and capacity expectations set forth in the agreements. In\nlimited cases, we also provide for an energy generation performance test designed to demonstrate that the\nactual energy generation for up to the first three years meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation\n(after adjusting for actual solar irradiation). In the event that the energy generation performance test\nperforms below expectations, the appropriate party (EPC contractor or equipment provider) may incur\nliquidated damages capped at a percentage of the contract price. Potential warranty claims may exceed the\nscope or amount of coverage under our insurance and, if they do, they could materially and adversely affect\nour business.\nIf we are unable to attract, train, retain, and successfully integrate key personnel into our management\nteam, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, train, and retain management,\noperations, sales, and technical personnel, including personnel in foreign jurisdictions. Recruiting and\nretaining capable personnel, particularly those with expertise in the solar industry across a variety of\ntechnologies, are vital to our success. We are also dependent on the services of our executive officers and\nother members of our senior management team. The loss of one or more of these key associates or any other\nmember of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may not\nbe able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place.\nSeveral of our current key associates, including our executive officers, are subject to employment\nconditions or arrangements that contain post-employment non-competition provisions. However, these\narrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice.\nThere are a limited number of purchasers of utility-scale quantities of electricity and entities that have\nthe ability to interconnect projects to the grid, which exposes us and our utility scale solar projects to\nadditional risk.\nSince the transmission and distribution of electricity is either monopolized or highly concentrated in most\njurisdictions, there are a limited number of possible purchasers for utility-scale quantities of electricity in a\ngiven geographic location, normally transmission grid operators, state and investor-owned power\ncompanies, public utility districts and cooperatives. As a result, there is a concentrated pool of potential\nbuyers for electricity generated by our solar power plants, which may restrict our ability to negotiate\nfavorable terms under new PPAs and could impact our ability to find new customers for the electricity\ngenerated by our solar power plants should this become necessary. Additionally, these possible purchasers\nmay have a role in connecting our projects to the grid to allow the flow of electricity. Furthermore, if the\nfinancial condition of these utilities and/or power purchasers deteriorates, or government policies or\nregulations to which they are subject and which compel them to source renewable energy supplies change,\ndemand for electricity produced by our plants or the ability to connect to the grid could be negatively\nimpacted. In addition, provisions in our PPAs or applicable laws may provide for the curtailment of delivery\nof electricity for various reasons, including preventing damage to transmission systems, system\nemergencies, force majeure or economic reasons. Such curtailment could reduce revenues to us from our\nPPAs. If we cannot enter into PPAs on terms favorable to us, or at all, or if the purchaser under our PPAs\nwere to exercise its curtailment or other rights to reduce purchases or payments under the PPAs, our\n54\nrevenues and our decisions regarding development of additional projects in the energy business may be\nadversely affected.\nHistorically, a limited number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of existing customers. Our top\ncustomer accounted for 57% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. It is not possible for us\nto predict the future level of demand from our largest customer. If our largest customer elects to not do\nfuture business with us, or decrease of our services, or if our largest customer otherwise seeks to renegotiate\nterms of their existing agreements on terms less favorable to us, our business and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Company has $7.9 million in accounts receivable outstanding from SFF for development\nservices performed for their solar contracts from December 2017 to July 2018. The Government of Ontario\ncancelled said solar contracts in July 2018 ceasing all development work. There is a risk that this receivable\nmay not be paid in 2023 or at all.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations can be expensive, and noncompliance with these\nregulations may result in adverse publicity and potentially significant monetary damages, fines and the\nsuspension or even termination of our business operations.\nWe are required to comply with all national and local environmental regulations. Our business generates\nnoise, wastewater, gaseous wastes and other industrial waste in our operations and the risk of incidents with\na potential environmental impact has increased as our business has expanded. We believe that we\nsubstantially comply with all relevant environmental laws and regulations and have all necessary and\nmaterial environmental permits to conduct our business as it is presently conducted. However, if more\nstringent regulations are adopted in the future, the costs of complying with these new regulations could be\nsubstantial. If we fail to comply with present or future environmental regulations, we may be required to\npay substantial fines, suspend production or cease operations.\nOur solar power projects must comply with the environmental regulations of the jurisdictions in which they\nare installed, and we may incur expenses to comply with such regulations. If compliance is unduly\nexpensive or unduly difficult, we may lose market share and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nAny failure by us to control our use or to restrict adequately the discharge, of hazardous substances could\nsubject us to potentially significant monetary damages, fines or suspensions of our business operations.\nCorporate responsibility, specifically related to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)\nmatters and unsuccessful management of such matters may adversely impose additional costs and\nexpose us to new risks.\nPublic ESG and sustainability reporting is becoming more broadly expected by investors, shareholders and\nother third parties. Certain organizations that provide corporate governance and other corporate risk\ninformation to investors and shareholders have developed, and others may in the future develop, scores and\nratings to evaluate companies and investment funds based upon ESG or “sustainability” metrics. Many\ninvestment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making\ninvestments and may consider a company’s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in\nmaking an investment decision. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, use these scores\nto benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may\nengage with such company to improve ESG disclosure or performance and may also make voting decisions,\nor take other actions, to hold these companies and their boards of directors accountable. We may face\nreputational damage in the event our corporate responsibility initiatives or objectives, including with respect\nto board diversity, do not meet the standards set by our investors, shareholders, lawmakers, listing\nexchanges or other constituencies, or if we are unable to achieve an acceptable ESG or sustainability rating\nfrom third party rating services. Ongoing focus on corporate responsibility matters by investors and other\n55\nparties as described above may impose additional costs or expose us to new risks, including increased risk\nof investigation and litigation, and negative impacts on the value of our products and access to capital,\nwhich may put us at a commercial disadvantage relative to our peers.\nFurthermore, various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could\nimplement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or\nrestrictions on water use, regulations on energy management and waste management, and other climate\nchange-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating\nresults. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Future\ncompliance with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics, such as COVID-19, and other\ncatastrophes, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophes, such as\nearthquakes, fire, floods, hail, windstorms, severe weather conditions, environmental accidents, power loss,\ncommunications failures, explosions, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our business could also be\nmaterially and adversely affected by public health emergencies, such as the outbreak of avian influenza,\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, Zika virus, Ebola virus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-\n19) or other local health epidemics in jurisdictions where we operate and global pandemics. If any of our\nemployees is suspected of having contracted any contagious disease, we may, under certain circumstances,\nbe required to quarantine those employees and the affected areas of our operations. As a result, we may\nhave to temporarily suspend part or all of our facilities. Furthermore, authorities may impose restrictions\non travel and transportation and implement other preventative measures in affected regions to deal with the\ncatastrophe or emergency, which may lead to the temporary closure of our facilities and declining economic\nactivity at large. A prolonged outbreak of any health epidemic or other adverse public health developments,\nin jurisdictions where we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to pose significant challenges to many aspects of our business,\nincluding our operations, customers, suppliers and projects. The extent to which the COVID-19 has and\nmay persist to impact our ability to effectively operate continues to be highly uncertain. The outbreak\ncontinues to evolve, and the impact that COVID-19, or new variants of COVID-19, will ultimately have on\nour result of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows cannot be estimated and is impossible\nto predict. We will continue to monitor and adhere to the policies, lockdowns, restrictions, and preventive\nmeasures implemented by the various government authorities, as well as general movement restrictions,\nsocial distancing and other measures imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and may incur significant losses resulting from operating hazards,\nproduct liability claims, project construction or business interruptions.\nOur operations involve the use, handling, generation, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of\nhazardous materials, which may result in fires, explosions, spills and other unexpected or dangerous\naccidents causing personal injuries or death, property damages, environmental damages and business\ninterruption. Although we currently carry third-party liability insurance against property damage, the\npolicies for this insurance are limited in scope and may not cover all claims relating to personal injury,\nproperty or environmental damage arising from incidents on our properties or relating to our operations.\nAny occurrence of these or other incidents which are not insured under our existing insurance policies could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFor projects we construct, we are exposed to risks associated with the design and construction that can\ncreate additional liabilities to our operations. We manage these risks by including contingencies to our\nconstruction costs, ensuring the appropriate insurance coverages are in place such as professional indemnity\nand construction all risk as well as obtaining indemnifications from our contractors where possible.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that these risk management strategies will always be successful.\n56\nInformation Technology Systems and Data Security Breaches.\nThe Company’s operations depend, in part, on how well it and its third party service providers protect\nnetworks, equipment, information technology (“IT”) systems and software against damage from a number\nof threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts, natural disasters, intentional damage and destruction,\nfire, power loss, hacking, computer viruses, vandalism and theft. The Company’s operations also depend\non the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, IT systems and software, as\nwell as pre-emptive expenses to mitigate the risks of failures. Any of these and other events could result in\ninformation system failures, delays and/or increase in capital expenses. The failure of information systems\nor a component of information systems could, depending on the nature of any such failure, adversely impact\nthe Company’s reputation and results of operations.\nThe Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends.\nThe Company’s current policy is to retain earnings to finance the development of its solar power projects\nand to otherwise reinvest in the Company. Therefore, the Company does not anticipate paying cash\ndividends on the Company’s shares in the foreseeable future. The Company’s dividend policy will be\nreviewed from time to time by the Company’s board in the context of its earnings, financial condition and\nother relevant factors. Until the time that the Company pays dividends, which the Company might never\ndo, Common Shareholders will not be able to receive a return on their Common Shares unless they sell\nthem.\nLitigation.\nFrom time to time, we have been and may be subject to disputes and litigation, with and without merit, that\nmay be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general, whether\nor not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to\npredict. Moreover, complaints filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek,\nand we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should\nthese lawsuits be resolved against us. Even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions, the\nultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates. Any resolution of litigation, or\nthreatened litigation, could involve the payment of damages or expenses by us, which may be significant\nor involve an agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business. Even if any future lawsuits\nare not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant. These costs may exceed\nthe dollar limits of our insurance policies or may not be covered at all by our insurance policies.\nThe Company cannot assure you that a market will continue to develop or exist for the Common\nShares or what the market price of the Common Shares will be.\nThe Company cannot assure that a market will be sustained now that the Company’s Common Shares are\nlisted on the CSE. If a market is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors to sell the Common Shares\nat an attractive price or at all. The Company cannot predict the prices at which the Common Shares will\ntrade.\nThe market price for the Company’s Common Shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations\nin response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control.\nThe market price for the Company’s Common Shares may be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in\nresponse to numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, including the following:\n actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company’s quarterly results of operations;\n recommendations by securities research analysts;\n changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies in the industry in which\nthe Company operates;\n57\n addition or departure of the Company’s executive officers and other key personnel;\n release or expiration of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on outstanding Common Shares;\n sales or perceived sales of additional Common Shares;\n significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital\ncommitments by or involving us or the Company’s competitors;\n operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\nfluctuations to the costs of vital production materials and services;\n changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as\ninterest rates;\n operating and share price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the\nCompany or from a lack of market comparable companies;\n news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory\nchanges and other related issues in the Company’s industry or target markets; and\n regulatory changes in the industry.\nFinancial markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly\naffected the market prices of equity securities of companies and that have often been unrelated to the\noperating performance, underlying asset values or prospects of such companies. Accordingly, the market\nprice of the Common Shares may decline even if the Company’s operating results, underlying asset values\nor prospects have not changed. Additionally, these factors, as well as other related factors, may cause\ndecreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary, which might result in impairment\nlosses. There can be no assurance that continuing fluctuations in price and volume will not occur. If such\nincreased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue, the Company’s operations could be adversely\naffected and the trading price of the Common Shares might be materially adversely affected.\nThe intentions of the existing shareholders regarding their long-term economic ownership are subject to\nchange. Factors that could cause the existing shareholders’ current intentions to change include changes in\neach of their personal circumstances, our succession planning or changes in our management, changes in\ntax laws, market conditions and our financial performance.\nFurther, we cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Common Shares or the effect, if any, that\nfuture issuances and sales of our Common Shares will have on the market price of our Common Shares.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Common Shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may\nadversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Shares. See “The Company may need to raise\nadditional capital in the future”.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future.\nThe Company’s capital needs in the future will depend upon factors such as its growth strategy and the\nsuccess of its solar power projects. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. The Company\nmay need additional debt or equity financing in the future. The Company cannot assure investors that any\nadditional financing, if required, will be available or, even if it is available that it will be on terms acceptable\nto the Company. If the Company raises additional funds by selling securities, the ownership of existing\nshareholders will be diluted. Any inability to obtain required financing could have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to raise capital in a timely manner will constrain the Company’s growth.\nThe Company’s growth depends on developing solar power projects, which requires capital. If the\nCompany experiences difficulty or delays in raising the funds it needs, it will delay its ability to develop\nsolar power projects. Additional future delays in obtaining funding may be caused by a combination of\nfactors. Future delays in obtaining funding in a timely manner will constrain or prevent the Company’s\ngrowth.\n58\nThe Company may be unable to support existing or new business if it does not raise sufficient funds.\nUnless the Company can obtain adequate financing from the sale of its securities, the Company will not\nhave sufficient funds and may be unable to support existing operations, expand operations, or operate its\nexpanded operations, and it will be unable to carry out its business plans. Without adequate financing the\nCompany may be unable to carry on its business. There is no assurance that the Company will raise adequate\nfunds in future financings.\nDilution.\nThe offering price of Common Shares may significantly exceed the net tangible book value per share of the\nCommon Shares. Accordingly, a purchaser of Common Shares may incur immediate and substantial\ndilution of his, her or its investment. If outstanding RSUs, options and warrants to purchase Common Shares\nare exercised or securities convertible into Common Shares are converted, additional dilution will occur.\nThe Company may sell additional Common Shares or other securities that are convertible or exchangeable\ninto Common Shares in subsequent offerings or may issue additional Common Shares or other securities\nto finance future acquisitions. The Company cannot predict the size or nature of future sales or issuances\nof securities or the effect, if any, that such future sales and issuances will have on the market price of the\nCommon Shares. Sales or issuances of substantial numbers of Common Shares or other securities that are\nconvertible or exchangeable into Common Shares, or the perception that such sales or issuances could\noccur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of the Common Shares. With any additional sale or\nissuance of Common Shares or other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares,\ninvestors will suffer dilution to their voting power and economic interest in the Company. Furthermore, to\nthe extent holders of the Company’s RSUs, Options or other convertible securities convert or exercise their\nsecurities and sell the Common Shares they receive, the trading price of the Common Shares on the CSE\nmay decrease due to the additional amount of Common Shares available in the market.\nImpact of securities or industry analysts’ reports.\nThe trading market for our Common Shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities\nor industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain\nresearch coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence\ncovering us, the trading price for our Common Shares would be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities\nor industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Common\nShares or publish inaccurate or unfavourable research about our business, our trading price may decline. If\none or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our\nCommon Shares could decrease, which could cause our trading price and volume to decline.\nRisks related to the book-based system\nUnless and until certificated Common Shares are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the\nCommon Shares, owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Common\nShares. Instead, the depository or its nominee will be the sole holder of the Common Shares. Unlike holders\nof the Common Shares themselves, owners of book-based interests will not have the direct right to act upon\nthe Company’s solicitations or requests or other actions from holders of the Common Shares. Instead,\nholders of beneficial interests in the Common Shares will be permitted to act only to the extent such holders\nhave received appropriate proxies to do so from CDS or, if applicable, a CDS participant. There is no\nassurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable holders\nof beneficial interests in the Common Shares to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.\n59\nDIVIDENDS\nThe Company has not, since the date of its incorporation, declared or paid any dividends on its Common\nShares and does not currently have a policy with respect to the payment of dividends. For the immediate\nfuture, the Company does not envisage any earnings arising from which dividends could be paid. The\npayment of dividends in the future will depend on the Company’s earnings, if any, the Company’s financial\ncondition and such other factors as the directors of the Company consider appropriate. There are no\ncontractual restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends.\nDESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nThe authorized share capital of the Company consists of an unlimited number of common shares without\npar value. As of the date hereof, 26,857,200 Common Shares were issued and outstanding as fully paid and\nnon-assessable common shares.\nThe Company is authorized to issue an unlimited number of Common Shares. Holders of Common Shares\nare entitled to receive notice of any meetings of Shareholders, to attend and to cast one vote per Common\nShare at all such meetings. Holders of Common Shares do not have cumulative voting rights with respect\nto the election of directors and, accordingly, holders of a majority of the Common Shares entitled to vote\nin any election of directors may elect all directors standing for election. Holders of Common Shares are\nentitled to receive on a pro-rata basis such dividends, if any, as and when declared by the Board at its\ndiscretion from funds legally available therefor and upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the\nCompany are entitled to receive on a pro-rata basis the net assets of the Company after payment of debts\nand other liabilities, in each case subject to the rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions attaching to\nany other series or class of shares ranking senior in priority to or on a pro-rata basis with the holders of\nCommon Shares with respect to dividends or liquidation. The Common Shares do not carry any pre-\nemptive, subscription, redemption or conversion rights, nor do they contain any sinking or purchase fund\nprovisions.\nMARKET FOR SECURITIES\nMarket\nThe Company’s Common Shares are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange under the trading symbol\n“SUNN”, listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the trading symbol “GY2”, and quoted on the\nOTCQX under the trading symbol “SUUNF”.\nTrading Price and Volume\nThe following table sets out the monthly high and low trading prices and the monthly volume of trading of\nthe Common Shares of the Company on the Canadian Securities Exchange for the most recently completed\nfinancial year:\nHigh (Cdn$) Low (Cdn$) Volume\nJuly 2022 N/A N/A N/A\nAugust 2022 N/A N/A N/A\nSeptember 2022 N/A N/A N/A\nOctober 2022 N/A N/A N/A\nNovember 2022 N/A N/A N/A\nDecember 2022 N/A N/A N/A\n60\nJanuary 2023 N/A N/A N/A\nFebruary 2023 N/A N/A N/A\nMarch 2023 2.90 1.75 887,043\nApril 2023 6.92 2.68 756,472\nMay 2023 7.27 6.02 162,880\nJune 2023 9.25 6.60 434,894\nPrior Sales\nThe following summarizes the Common Shares and securities convertible into Common Shares issued by\nthe Company during the most recently completed financial year.\nDate of Issuance Security Type Number of Securities Issue/Exercise Price\nOctober 3, 2022 Advisory Warrants 2,500,000 $0.10\nOctober 3, 2022 Convertible Loan $1,250,000(1) $0.50\nNovember 4, 2022 Options 2,774,000 $0.75\nNovember 4, 2022 RSUs 500,000 N/A\nMarch 1, 2023 Common Shares 8,050,000 $0.75\nMarch 1, 2023 Agent’s Warrants 483,000 $0.75\nMarch 1, 2023 Common Shares 2,500,000 $0.50\nMarch 1, 2023 Series A Warrants 2,500,000 $0.50\nMarch 1, 2023 Series B Warrants 2,500,000 $0.50\nMarch 8, 2023 Common Shares 250,000 $2.35\nMarch 13, 2023 RSUs 15,000 N/A\nNote:\n(1) The principal sum of the Convertible Loan is equal to $1,250,000 and was automatically converted into Conversion Units\nupon the closing of the IPO. The Convertible Loan was converted at a price of $0.50 per Conversion Units. The\nConversion Units consist of 2,500,000 Common Shares, 2,500,000 Series A Warrants and 2,500,000 Series B Warrants.\nThe Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants, upon the satisfaction of the Series A Warrant Vesting Condition and Series\nB Warrant Vesting Condition (as applicable) are exercisable into Common Shares at an exercise price of $0.50 per\nCommon Share.\nESCROWED SECURITIES AND SECURITIES SUBJECT TO CONTRACTUAL\nRESTRICTION ON TRANSFER\nContractual Escrow Securities\nThe Company and non-Principal existing holders of Common Shares prior to the IPO entered into an\nagreement with the Company (the “Voluntary Escrow Agreements”) in the form of escrow agreement\n61\nprovided under National Policy 46-201 Escrow For Initial Public Offerings (the “Voluntary Escrow”)\nsetting out contractual escrow terms, being a 36 month voluntary trading restriction where 10% of each\nholder’s shares are released at the Listing Date, and 15% of each holder’s shares are released at the six,\ntwelve, eighteen, twenty-four, thirty and thirty-six month anniversaries of the Listing Date. Any Common\nShares issuable on the exercise of 6,275,000 Warrants and 975,000 Stock Options are subject to the same\nterms of the Voluntary Escrow. A copy of the Voluntary Escrow Agreement will be available under the\nCompany’s profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com.\nAs of the dated of the AIF, pursuant to the Voluntary Escrow Agreement, the following securities of the\nCompany are subject to contractual restrictions on transfer as shown in the following table:\nTotal number of securities\nthat are subject to a\ncontractual restriction on\nDesignation of Class transfer (1) Percentage of Class\nCommon Shares 13,070,108 48.67%\nWarrants 4,706,250 59.36%\nNational Policy 46-201 Escrow\nNP 46-201 provides that all securities of an issuer owned or controlled by a Principal must be placed in\nescrow at the time the issuer distributes its securities or convertible securities to the public by prospectus,\nunless the securities held by such Principal or issuable to such Principal upon conversion of convertible\nsecurities held by the Principal collectively represent less than 1% of the total issued and outstanding\nsecurities of the issuer after giving effect to the initial distribution. As such, the securities held by the\nPrincipals are held in escrow pursuant to the policies of NP 46-201.\nThe following table sets forth the securities of the Principals that, as at the date of the AIF, are subject to\nescrow and the percentage that number represents of the outstanding securities of that class.\nTotal number of securities\nDesignation of Class that are held in escrow(1) Percentage of Class\nCommon Shares 804,900 3.00%\nWarrants 918,750 11.59%\nThe Company and the Principals entered into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) with\nEndeavor Trust Corporation, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), pursuant to which the Escrowed\nShareholders collectively deposited the Common Shares and Warrants listed in the table above into escrow\n(the “Escrowed Securities”) with the Escrow Agent.\nThe Company is currently an “emerging issuer” pursuant to NP 46-201 and, as such, the Escrowed\nSecurities are subject to a three year escrow and subject to the following release scheduled:\nDate Amount of Escrowed Securities Released\nOn the Listing Date 1/10 of the escrow securities\n6 months after the Listing Date 1/6 of the remaining escrow securities\n12 months after the Listing Date 1/5 of the remaining escrow securities\n18 months after the Listing Date 1/4 of the remaining escrow securities\n24 months after the Listing Date 1/3 of the remaining escrow securities\n62\n30 months after the Listing Date 1/2 of the remaining escrow securities\n36 months after the Listing Date the remaining escrow securities\nThe release schedule may be accelerated if the Company establishes itself as an “established issuer” as\ndescribed in NP 46-201.\nA copy of the Escrow Agreement is available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR+ at\nwww.sedarplus.com.\nDIRECTORS AND OFFICERS\nThe names and province or state and country of residence of the directors and executive officers of\nSolarBank, positions held by them with SolarBank and their principal occupations for the past five years\nare as set forth below.

The Projects (defined below) represent SolarBank’s initial foray into battery energy storage, a market forecast by Fortune Business Insights to grow at a 16.3% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to reach US$31.2 billion by 20291. SolarBank’s interest in ProjectCos was acquired as part of the $45 million valued acquisition of Solar Flow-Through Funds Ltd. that closed in July 2024.\n\nThe Company is developing three 4.99 MW Battery Energy Storage System (“**BESS** ”) projects located in Ontario (the “**Projects** ”). The Projects are owned by 1000234763 Ontario Inc. and 1000234813 Ontario Inc. (“**ProjectCos** ”). Solar High Yield Projects #1 Ltd. (“the **Borrower** ”) is the borrower under the terms of the Loan.\n\nMatthew Wayrynen, Chair of SolarBank stated: “We are thrilled to continue our partnership with RE Royalties to secure this financing for our BESS projects in Ontario. Having worked with RE Royalties on previous projects, we value their expertise and shared commitment to sustainability. This financing is a key step toward a cleaner future and the further diversification of SolarBank’s growing project portfolio.”\n\nBernard Tan, CEO of RE Royalties, stated: “We are excited to be working with the SolarBank management team again on this transaction. The SolarBank team has a long proven track record in developing, building and operating renewable energy assets in North America. These BESS projects will help the province of Ontario support renewable electricity generation, build resiliency in the grid, and help lower emissions compared to conventional sources.”\n\nThe Loan will be advanced in a single installment and has a maturity date of November 26, 2025. The Loan bears interest at a rate of 11% per annum. As a condition of the Loan a 0.40% royalty on the gross revenues generated by the Projects has been granted to the Lender. The royalty rate shall be reduced to 0.25% if the Loan is repaid within the first six months. The Loan is secured by a first ranking security interest over all assets of the Borrower, except for its shares in the capital of theProjectCos. The Borrower is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Borrower has an indirect 50% interest in ProjectCos, with the remaining 50% held by a partnership formed by First Nations communities in Ontario. The Loan is for incurred development and construction costs for the Projects and the Company continues to advance a project financing package for the full construction costs of the Projects.\n\nThere are several risks associated with the development of the Projects. The development of any project is subject to required permits, the continued availability of third-party financing arrangements for the Company and the risks associated with the construction of a battery energy storage project. In addition, governments may revise, reduce or eliminate incentives and policy support schemes for battery energy storage, which could result in future projects no longer being economic. Please refer to “Forward-Looking Statements” for additional discussion of the assumptions and risk factors associated with the projects and statements made in this press release.\n\n1 <https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/battery-energy-storage-market-100489>\n\n**About SolarBank Corporation**\n\nSolarBank Corporation is an independent renewable and clean energy project developer and owner focusing on distributed and community solar projects in Canada and the USA.

Actual\noutcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of the experience and perception of historical trends, its current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that it believes might affect its financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial\nneeds and expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve assumptions and risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. In making the forward-looking statements included in this presentation, the Company has made various material\nassumptions, including but not limited to: (i) obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals; (ii) that regulatory requirements will be maintained; (iii) general business and economic conditions; (iv) the Company’s ability to successfully execute its plans and intentions; (v) the satisfaction of all conditions of closing and the successful completion of the\nAcquisition; (vi) the realization of the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition in the timeframe anticipated; (vii) the absence of significant undisclosed costs or liabilities associated with the Acquisition (viii ) the availability of financing on reasonable terms; (ix) the Company’s ability to attract and retain skilled staff; (x) market competition; (xi) the\nproducts and services offered by the Company’s competitors; (xii) that the Company’s current good relationships with its service providers and other third parties will be maintained; and (xiii) government subsidies and funding for renewable energy will continue as currently contemplated.

the failure to raise capital in a timely manner will constrain the Company’s growth; the Company may be unable to\nsupport existing or new business if it does not raise sufficient funds; securities or industry analysts’ reports could impact the trading market for the Common Shares; owners of book-entry interests in the Common Shares will not be considered owners or holders of the Common Shares; future sales of Common Shares by existing shareholders could\nreduce the market price of the Company’s shares;

market rate fluctuations could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations; the\nCompany’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy resulting from the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine;

the Company’s senior management team has limited experience managing a public company, and regulatory compliance may divert its attention from the day-to-day management of the Company’s business.\nThese factors should not be considered exhaustive.

          "content": "SOLARBANK CORPORATION STATEMENT OF DIFFERENCES\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION\nSTATEMENT OF CORPORATE\nGOVERNANCE DIFFERENCES\nApril 8, 2024\nNASDAQ STATEMENT OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE DIFFERENCES\nSolarBank Corporation (“SolarBank” or the “Company”) is a corporation formed under the laws of\nOntario, Canada. As a “foreign private issuer” under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\nas amended, SolarBank is permitted, pursuant to Nasdaq Stock Market Rule 5615(a)(3), to follow\nits home country practice in lieu of certain Nasdaq corporate governance standards provided\nSolarBank discloses and describes the differences between its corporate governance practices\nand those required by Nasdaq. Below we describe the significant ways in which our corporate\ngovernances practices differ from the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules. References below to a “Rule”\nbelow are references to the referenced rule in the Nasdaq Stock Market Rules.\nMajority Independent Rule 5605(b)(1) requires that a majority of the board of directors must\nBoard of Directors be comprised of “Independent Directors” as defined in\nRule 5605(a)(2). The Company complies with all applicable\nCanadian provincial securities laws and rules of the Cboe Canada\nExchange (“Cboe”), which do not require that the majority of the\nboard of directors of the Company be comprised of “Independent\nDirectors” as defined in Rule 5605(a)(2). Cboe requires the Company\nto have a board of directors that includes at least two independent\ndirectors or, when the board of directors consists of six or more\nmembers, must be composed of at least one-third independent\ndirectors. Cboe defines an independent director as a director who is\nindependent in accordance with applicable provincial securities laws.\nShareholder Meeting The Company does not follow Rule 5620(c) which requires that the\nQuorum Requirement minimum quorum for a meeting of shareholders be no less than\n33 1/3% of the outstanding common shares.\nCboe requires that quorum for shareholder meetings comply with\ncorporate and securities laws applicable to the company. SolarBank\nis governed by the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “OBCA”)\nwhich provides that, unless otherwise stated in its bylaws, quorum for\na meeting of shareholder is a majority of the shares entitled to vote\nat the meeting represented in person or by proxy. However,\nSolarBank’s bylaws provide that quorum for a meeting of\nshareholders is at least 5% of the shares of the Company entitled to\nvote at the meeting.\nShareholder Approval Rule 5635(a) requires shareholder approval prior to the issuance of\nRequirements securities in connection with the acquisition of the stock or assets of\nanother company in certain circumstances, including (1) where the\ncommon stock to be issued will have voting power equal to or in\nexcess of 20% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance,\nor the number of shares to be issued will be equal to or in excess of\n20% of the number of shares outstanding before the issuance; and\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION STATEMENT OF DIFFERENCES\n(2) if any director, officer or substantial shareholder of the Company\nhas a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10%\nor greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the company or assets to\nbe acquired or in the consideration to be paid, and the present or\npotential issuance of securities could result in an increase in\noutstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more.\nThe Company complies with the applicable requirements of the Cboe\nwhich requires shareholder approval for an acquisition where the\nnumber of securities issuable on a fully diluted basis is more than\n25% of the total number of securities or votes. Further, Cboe rules\nrequire shareholder approval where the number of securities issued\nor issuable to persons related to the Company for the acquisition,\ntogether with any other acquisitions over the preceding six months,\nis more than 10% of the total number of securities of the Company\noutstanding.\nRule 5635(c) requires shareholder approval of most equity\ncompensation or purchase plans or arrangements and material\namendments thereto (with a few limited exceptions), and this applies\nwhether the securities issuable pursuant to such plan or arrangement\nare newly issued or bought over the open market. The Company\ncomplies with the applicable requirements of the Cboe which require\nshareholder approval of evergreen equity compensation plans (being\nplans that replenish upon exercise of awards) every three years and\nmust specifically approving unallocated entitlements under an\nevergreen plan. In addition, the Company complies with Cboe rules\nthat require that the Company’s board of directors (excluding\ndirectors who would receive a benefit from the amendment) may\napprove amendments to an equity compensation plan or award as\nprovided by the plan. If the directors cannot approve the amendment,\nthe amendment must be approved by the Company’s shareholders\n(other than shareholders who would receive a benefit from the\namendment). Furthermore, shareholder approval is required for any\naction that increases the size of the pool beyond 10% of the\noutstanding securities of the Company, re-prices an award benefiting\na person related to the Company, extends the term of an award\nbenefitting a person related to the Company or where the exercise\nprice is lower than the prevailing market price, removes limits in the\nplan applicable to persons related to the Company, or amends the\namending provision of the plan.\nExecutive Sessions The Company does not follow Rule 5605(b)(2), which requires\ncompanies to have their independent directors regularly schedule\n2\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION STATEMENT OF DIFFERENCES\nmeetings at which only independent directors are present (commonly\ncalled, “executive sessions”).\nIn lieu Rule 5605(b)(2), the Company is subject to the requirements\nof applicable provincial securities laws, namely National Instrument\n58-101 – Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices (“NI 58-\n101”) and National Policy 58-201 – Corporate Governance\nGuidelines (“NP 58-201”) issued by the Canadian Securities\nAdministrators. NI 58-101 requires disclosure of a number of items in\nrelation to corporate governance practices, including disclosure\nregarding the Company’s independent director meeting practices, in\nthe management information circular of the Company. Under NI 58-\n101 the Company is required to disclose whether or not the\nindependent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which\nnon-independent directors and members of management are not in\nattendance. If the independent directors hold such meetings, the\nCompany must disclose the number of meetings held since the\nbeginning of its most recently completed financial year. If the\nindependent directors do not hold such meetings, the Company must\ndisclose what the board does to facilitate open and candid discussion\namong its independent directors. NI 58-101 only requires disclosure\nof the above noted matters and it does not mandate any requirements\nfor independent director meetings.\nNP 58-201 sets out guidelines for corporate governance which\ninclude suggested practices in relation to independent director\nmeetings. NP 58-201 provides guidelines only and adherence to the\nguidelines in NP 58-201 is not a legal requirement. The guidelines in\nNP 58-201 recommend that the independent directors should hold\nregularly scheduled meetings at which non-independent directors\nand members of management are not in attendance. As noted above,\nthe guidelines NP 58-201 are not mandatory.\nAudit Committee Rule 5605(c)(1) requires that the formal written audit committee\nCharter charter of an issuer specifies the audit committee’s responsibility for\nensuring its receipt from the outside auditors of a formal written\nstatement delineating all relationships between the auditor and the\nCompany, actively engaging in a dialogue with the auditor with\nrespect to any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the\nobjectivity and independence of the auditor and for taking, or\nrecommending that the full board take, appropriate action to oversee\nthe independence of the outside auditor.\nAs required by applicable home country laws, the Charter of the Audit\nCommittee of the Company provides for the Audit Committee’s\n3\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION STATEMENT OF DIFFERENCES\nresponsibility to assess the independence, qualifications and\nperformance of the Company’s auditor, appoint and replace the\nauditor, oversee the audit and non-audit services provided by the\nauditor, and approve the compensation of the auditor.\nCompensation The Company does not follow Rule 5605(d)(1), which requires a\nCommittee Charter company certify it has adopted a formal written compensation\ncommittee charter and that the committee review and reassess the\nadequacy of the charter on an annual basis. Further,\nRule 5606(d)(3)(D) provides that a company may only receive advice\nfrom a compensation consultant after taking into consideration\ncertain independence and other risk factors delineated in that Rule.\nAs permitted by its home country laws, the Company has a single\ncommittee responsible for compensation, corporate governance, and\nnominating directors. The Charter of the Compensation, Corporate\nGovernance and Nominating Committee does not require the\ncommittee to review and reassess the adequacy of the charter on\nannual basis; however, it does provide that the Compensation,\nCorporate Governance and Nominating Committee will review the\nCharter of each committee of the Board and make recommendations\nto the Board with respect thereto in order to ensure that all aspects\nof corporate governance of the Company and its management and\nthe performance of the Company’s obligations to its shareholders,\nemployees and members of the public are being effectively reviewed.\nIn addition, the charter provides that the committee may retain and\nobtain advice from a compensation consultant in its sole discretion\nand must assess the independence of the compensation consultant\nbut does not specify specific factors.\nNominations The Company does not follow Rule 5605(e)(2), which requires a\nCommittee Charter company to certify that it has adopted a formal written charter or\nboard resolution addressing the nominations process and related\nmatters as required under applicable United States federal securities\nlaws.\nInstead, the Company has adopted a formal written charter for its\nCompensation, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee\nwhich provides for the committee’s purpose and its responsibilities as\nto nomination and succession, among other things, as required by\napplicable Ontario laws and Cboe rules.\nRelated Party Rule 5630 requires that a company conduct appropriate review and\nTransactions oversight of all related party transactions for potential conflicts of\n4\nSOLARBANK CORPORATION STATEMENT OF DIFFERENCES\ninterest situations on an ongoing basis by the company’s audit\ncommittee or another independent body of the board of directors.\nThe Company is subject to applicable provincial law, namely\nMultilateral Instrument 61-101 – Protection of Minority Security\nHolders in Special Transactions, which imposes special requirements\nfor related party transactions that can include formal valuations,\nminority shareholder approval requirements and approval of\ntransactions by independent directors or a committee consisting\nsolely of independent directors.\n5"
