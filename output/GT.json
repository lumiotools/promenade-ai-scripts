19\nIMPORTANT\nDISCLOSURES\nQ3 2024 - 20\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain information contained in this presentation constitutes forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of The Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995. There are a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, that affect our operations, performance, business strategy\nand results and could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the assumptions, expectations and objectives expressed in any forward-\nlooking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to implement successfully the Goodyear Forward plan and our other strategic\ninitiatives, including the sale of our off-the-road tire business; risks relating to the ability to consummate the sale of our off-the-road tire business on a timely\nbasis or at all, including failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or to satisfy other conditions to closing; actions and initiatives taken by both current\nand potential competitors; increases in the prices paid for raw materials and energy; inflationary cost pressures; delays or disruptions in our supply chain or the\nprovision of services to us; a prolonged economic downturn or period of economic uncertainty; deteriorating economic conditions or an inability to access\ncapital markets; a labor strike, work stoppage, labor shortage or other similar event; financial difficulties, work stoppages, labor shortages or supply disruptions\nat our suppliers or customers; the adequacy of our capital expenditures; changes in tariffs, trade agreements or trade restrictions; foreign currency translation\nand transaction risks; our failure to comply with a material covenant in our debt obligations; potential adverse consequences of litigation involving the company;\nas well as the effects of more general factors such as changes in general market, economic or political conditions or in legislation, regulation or public policy.\nAdditional factors are discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on\nForm 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon\nas representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically\ndisclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change.\nQuarter Highlights Financial Results SBU Results Outlook Important Disclosures Appendix\nQ3 2024 - 21\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Unaudited)\nThis presentation presents non-GAAP financial measures, including Total Segment Operating Income and Margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss)\nand Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) which are important financial measures for the company but are not financial measures defined by U.S. GAAP,\nand should not be construed as alternatives to corresponding financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nTotal Segment Operating Income is the sum of the individual strategic business units’ (SBUs’) Segment Operating Income as determined in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. Total Segment Operating Margin is Total Segment Operating Income divided by Net Sales as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management\nbelieves that Total Segment Operating Income and Margin are useful because they represent the aggregate value of income created by the company’s SBUs and\nexclude items not directly related to the SBUs for performance evaluation purposes. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to Total\nSegment Operating Income and Margin are Goodyear Net Income (Loss) and Return on Net Sales (which is calculated by dividing Goodyear Net Income (Loss) by\nNet Sales).\nFree Cash Flow is the company’s Cash Flows from Operating Activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less capital expenditures, net of insurance\nrecoveries. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful because it represents the cash generating capability of the company’s ongoing operations, after\ntaking into consideration capital expenditures necessary to maintain its business and pursue growth opportunities. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measure is Cash Flows from Operating Activities.\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss) is Goodyear Net Income (Loss) as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP adjusted for certain significant items. Adjusted Diluted\nEarnings Per Share (EPS) is the company’s Adjusted Net Income (Loss) divided by Weighted Average Shares Outstanding-Diluted as determined in accordance\nwith U.S. GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) are useful because they represent how\nmanagement reviews the operating results of the company excluding the impacts of rationalizations, asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation, impairments,\nasset sales and certain other significant items.\nIt should be noted that other companies may calculate similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures differently and, as a result, the measures presented herein\nmay not be comparable to such similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. See the following tables for reconciliations of historical Total Segment\nOperating Income and Margin, Free Cash Flow, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP\nfinancial measures.\nQuarter Highlights Financial Results SBU Results Outlook Important Disclosures Appendix\nQ3 2024 -
