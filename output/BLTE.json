The pace of enrollment for the PHOENIX trial remains strong, and in the quarter, we completed the Phase 1b DRAGON II trial of Tinlarebant in Stargardt disease in Japan and dosed the first patient in the Phase 2/3 portion of the trial. We are well-positioned to achieve critical milestones and look forward to providing an update on the interim analysis from our pivotal Phase 3 DRAGON trial toward the end of 2024 or early 2025,” said Dr. Tom Lin, Chairman and CEO of Belite. “In the quarter, we were also excited to welcome Dr. Scholl, a leading global expert in Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration, as our Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Scholl’s decision to join Belite following his experience as Chair of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board for both our Phase 2 and Phase 3 Stargardt disease trials further validates our belief in Tinlarebant’s immense potential.”\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones:_**\n\n**Clinical Highlights**\n\n**Tinlarebant**(LBS-008) is an oral, potent, once daily retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) antagonist that decreases RBP4 levels in the blood and reduces vitamin A (retinol) delivery to the eye without disrupting systemic retinol delivery to other tissues. Vitamin A is critical to normal vision but can accumulate as toxic byproducts in individuals affected with STGD1 and GA (the advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD) leading to retinal cell death and loss of vision.\n\n  * **Stargardt disease (STGD1):** Accumulation of cytotoxic vitamin A byproducts (bisretinoids) has been implicated in the onset and progression of STGD1. Tinlarebant has been granted Fast Track Designation and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S., Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and Sakigake (Pioneer Drug) Designation in Japan for the treatment of STGD1. \n    * DRAGON Trial: Ongoing, 24-month, randomized (2:1, active: placebo), double-masked, placebo-controlled, global, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 trial in adolescent STGD1 subjects \n      * Completed enrollment with 104 subjects in 11 countries\n      * Primary efficacy endpoint is slowing of atrophic lesion growth rate; safety and tolerability will also be assessed\n      * Company expects to report interim analysis by end of 2024 or early 2025\n    * DRAGON II Trial: Combination of Phase 1b open-label trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Tinlarebant in Japanese adolescent STGD1 subjects and a Phase 2/3, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter, trial in adolescent STGD1 subjects \n      * Completed Phase 1b portion of the trial with six subjects evaluated in Japan\n      * Dosed first patient in Phase 2/3 trial, with a target enrollment of approximately 60 subjects, aged 12 to 20 years old, including approximately 10 Japanese subjects; data from the Japanese subjects is intended to facilitate a future new drug application in Japan\n      * Primary efficacy endpoint is slowing of atrophic lesion growth rate; safety and tolerability will also be assessed\n  * **Geographic Atrophy (GA):** GA is a chronic degenerative disease of the retina that leads to blindness in the elderly. Accumulation of toxic vitamin A byproducts (bisretinoids) has been implicated in the progression of GA. There are currently no FDA-approved, orally administered treatments for GA. \n    * PHOENIX Trial: Ongoing, 24-month, randomized (2:1, active: placebo; n~430 subjects), double-masked, placebo-controlled, global, multi-center, pivotal Phase 3 trial in patients with GA \n      * More than 280 subjects have been enrolled as of November 11, 2024\n      * Primary efficacy endpoint is slowing of atrophic lesion growth rate; safety and tolerability will also be assessed\n      * Company expects to conduct interim analysis at the mid-point of the trial\n\n\n\n**_Corporate Highlights_**\n\nHendrik P. N. Scholl, MD, MA, was appointed as the Company’s Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Scholl is the foremost globally recognized authority on Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration and brings to Belite decades of expertise in treating retinal diseases, including the two key indications targeted by Tinlarebant.\n\nBelite also recently announced the exercise of warrants by certain holder of Belite’s outstanding warrants, pursuant to which Belite received total gross proceeds of approximately $28.75 million, which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes.\n\n**_Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results:_**\n\n**Current Assets:**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had $109.0 million in cash, money market fund, time deposits and U.S treasury bills.\n\n**R &D Expenses:**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $6.8 million compared to $8.7 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was mainly attributed to fewer contract research organization milestone payments related to the DRAGON trial, partially offset by the increase in the DRAGON II trial expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, research and development expenses were $22.7 million compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to (i) a royalty payment for completion of a Phase 2 trial, and (ii) share-based compensation granted in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**G &A Expenses:**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $2.9 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administration expenses were $5.9 million compared to $4.7 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to an increase in share-based compensation granted in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n**Other Income:**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, other income was $1.1 million compared to $0.03 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other income was $2.5 million compared to $0.08 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in other income was attributable to accrued interest from time deposits and U.S. treasury bills.\n\n**Net Loss:**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $8.7 million, compared to a net loss of $10.9 million for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of $26.0 million, compared to a net loss of $24.6 million for the same period in 2023.\n\n**_Webcast Information_**\n\nBelite Bio will host a webcast on Tuesday, November 12, 2024, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results and provide a business update.

The gross proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the warrants are expected to be approximately US$28.75 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes.\n\nThe ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are registered pursuant to effective registration statement on Form F-3 (File No. 333-272125) filed with the SEC on May 30, 2023. The offering is expected to close on or about November 4, 2024, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nIn consideration for the immediate exercise of the warrants for cash, the Company will issue new unregistered warrants to purchase up to 651,380 ordinary shares. The new warrants will have an exercise price of US$70.00 per share, will be exercisable immediately upon issuance and will expire five years from the date of issuance. If the investor were to exercise the new warrants in full, the gross proceeds from such new warrants would be approximately US$45.6 million.\n\nThe new warrants described above were offered in a private placement pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), have not been registered under the 1933 Act, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or an applicable exemption from such registration requirements.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or other jurisdiction.\n\n**About Belite Bio**\n\nBelite Bio is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical drug development company focused on advancing novel therapeutics targeting retinal degenerative eye diseases which have significant unmet medical needs such as (i) atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), commonly known as Geographic Atrophy (GA) in advanced dry AMD, and (ii) autosomal recessive Stargardt disease type 1, or STGD1, in addition to specific metabolic diseases.
