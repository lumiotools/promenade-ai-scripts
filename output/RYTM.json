(Nasdaq: RYTM), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases, today announced the presentation of new, real-world data that showed four pediatric patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity or congenital hypothalamic obesity achieved >5% weight reduction at three months on setmelanotide, a melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist. These data were among five Rhythm-related presentations delivered during the 62nd annual meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology (EPSE) in Liverpool, England.\n\n“Patients living with hypothalamic obesity – whether acquired or congenital –are mostly refractory to lifestyle programs and anti-obesity medicines that do not address the underlying cause,” said David Meeker, M.D., Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Rhythm. “Based on these case reports and insight generated through our pre-approval early-access program for setmelanotide in France, we look forward to exploring the potential efficacy of setmelanotide to offer a new therapy for these patients.”\n\n**3-month real-world setmelanotide hunger and weight outcomes in four French pediatric patients with acquired or congenital hypothalamic obesity** The presentation includes results from four case reports of patients <18 years old, two with acquired hypothalamic obesity and two with congenital hypothalamic obesity, at month three on setmelanotide therapy:\n\n  * Congenital hypothalamic obesity: \n    * Female, age 15, with septo-optic dysplasia as cause of hypothalamic obesity, achieved a body weight decrease of 9.6% from baseline (94 kg) at month 3 and BMI-Z score change from 3.1 at baseline to 2.8;\n    * Male, age 9, with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) as cause of hypothalamic obesity, achieved a body weight decrease of 5.2% from baseline (64 kg) at month 3 and BMI-Z score change from 3.7 at baseline to 3.5;\n  * Acquired hypothalamic obesity: \n    * Male, age 13, with acquired hypothalamic obesity related to craniopharyngioma resected at age 9, achieved a body weight decrease of 5.6% from baseline (116 kg) at month 3 and 9.5% weight reduction at month 6, and BMI-Z score change from 3.7 at baseline to 3.4 at month six of setmelanotide therapy; and\n    * Male, age 13, with acquired hypothalamic obesity related to radiotherapy for juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma, achieved a body weight decrease of 8.3% from baseline (88.3 kg) at month 3 and BMI-Z score change from 3.1 at baseline to 2.8.\n\n\n\nThese patients were treated with setmelanotide at four different hospitals in France under a pre-marketing, early-access authorization program. All four patients remain on therapy, as of November 15, 2024, and there were no new safety signals observed.\n\n“These patients present with differences and complexities associated with hypothalamic obesity, but these conditions share the same disrupted MC4R pathway signaling,” said Dr. Ahlam Azar-Kolakez, MD, Endocrinology-Diabetology Department, Reference Center for Endocrine Growth and Developmental Diseases, Robert Debré Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, France. “These real-world results are the first reported evidence of setmelanotide treatment for patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity demonstrating that it may be an effective, targeted therapy for both acquired and congenital hypothalamic obesity despite differences in etiology.”\n\nAlso today, Rhythm announced plans for a new, 34-week substudy designed to evaluate setmelanotide in 39 patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity aged 4 years and older. Rhythm is seeking approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the independent substudy for congenital hypothalamic obesity as a protocol amendment to the Company’s ongoing Phase 3 trial evaluating setmelanotide in patients with acquired hypothalamic obesity. Rhythm anticipates enrolling the first patients with congenital hypothalamic obesity in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe substudy in congenital hypothalamic obesity is independent from Rhythm’s pivotal Phase 3 trial in acquired hypothalamic obesity. The Company remains on track to disclose topline data from that pivotal trial in the first half of 2025.\n\n**About Congenital Hypothalamic Obesity** Congenital hypothalamic obesity is a rare disease caused by certain inborn brain abnormalities that may impair the function of the MC4R pathway, which regulates satiety or food intake and energy expenditure. The hallmark features of this disease include hyperphagia and early-onset, refractory obesity that is often linked to an impairment in the MC4R pathway associated with several pituitary deficiencies. Rare diseases that may cause congenital hypothalamic obesity include septo-optic displasia (or de Morsier syndrome), optic nerve hypoplasia, multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (also known as combined pituitary hormone deficiency) and pituitary stalk interruption syndrome. Each of these diseases is considered rare, and between 12% and 40% of patients with these diseases may have congenital hypothalamic obesity. Rhythm’s preliminary estimate of the prevalence of congenital hypothalamic obesity is in excess of 1,000 patients in the United States with a similar prevalence in Europe.\n\n**Additional Presentations at ESPE 2024** In a poster entitled, “Evaluating Setmelanotide Treatment for 12 Months in Pediatric Age Groups With Rare Melanocortin-4 Receptor Pathway–Related Obesity: Efficacy in Weight Reduction and Safety Outcomes,” presenters highlighted the importance of early intervention in young patients with rare MC4R pathway diseases. A cross-sectional analysis of 50 patients aged 2 to 17 years with rare MC4R pathway diseases who participated in one of five different clinical trials of setmelanotide was presented showing that patients regardless of age achieved clinically meaningful weight reductions, and that children between 2 and 5 years old achieved a greater absolute BMI Z reduction.\n\nAdditionally, the Company delivered three oral presentations based on analyses of more than 5,000 sequencing samples from the Company’s European genetic testing program for individuals with suspected rare MC4R pathway diseases, Rare Obesity Advanced Diagnosis or ROAD®. Genetic testing of individuals with early-onset obesity can help improve disease etiology understanding and identify patients who may benefit from specialized care.\n\nHighlights from these three presentations included:\n\n  * 1.74% of individuals tested carried a biallelic variant in one of 22 tested genes related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), and the frequency in Turkey was 5.82%, potentially due to consanguinity rates;\n  * 22.5% of tested individuals with early-onset obesity carried a variant classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic or of unknown significance (VUS) of one or more genes closely associated with MC4R pathway function: _SIM1, SEMA3_ family, _PLXNA_ family, _POMC, PCSK1, LEPR, SH2B1_ and _NCOA1_ ; and\n  * 4.9% of tested individuals carried a biallelic or heterozygous pathogenic, likely pathogenic or VUS variant in one or more of these genes: _ALMS1_ , _BBS_ , _MAGEL2_ , _PHIP_ , or _TBX3_ genes. These genes are associated with certain debilitating syndromes.\n\n\n\nAll of the Rhythm-related presentations from ESPE 2024 are available here: [https://hcp.rhythmtx.com/publications-presentations/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=MwEhnJyEtYckj9S-7H8B1lQAZGJs7pIMGUPosYmNTTqHxKQKCdCS-qfpWk408gDREcuP0RuNjGK61qm_3yDh71UaSm3N36Xtn32ab05u81cln5Pi4x0dNcMM9qpgDqSaTpJMV9baGLPa7aSOqYeujnnKa5DHfuyWPQNzjE3dFI1oxrRKOu9B6oG2ysuVzS-w).\n\n**About Rhythm Pharmaceuticals** Rhythm is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the lives of patients and their families living with rare neuroendocrine diseases. Rhythm’s lead asset, IMCIVREE® (setmelanotide), an MC4R agonist designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing, or patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Both the European Commission (EC) and the UK’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have authorized setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. The EC has also authorized setmelanotide for control of hunger and treatment of obesity in children as young as 2 years old, living with BBS or POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency. Additionally, Rhythm is advancing a broad clinical development program for setmelanotide in other rare diseases, as well as investigational MC4R agonists LB54640 and RM-718, and a preclinical suite of small molecules for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism. Rhythm’s headquarters is in Boston, MA.\n\n**Setmelanotide Indication** In the United States, setmelanotide is indicated for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in _POMC_ , _PCSK1_ or _LEPR_ genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS) or BBS.\n\nIn the European Union, setmelanotide is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 2 years of age and above. In Europe, setmelanotide should be prescribed and supervised by a physician with expertise in obesity with underlying genetic etiology.\n\n**Limitations of Use** Setmelanotide is not indicated for the treatment of patients with the following conditions as setmelanotide would not be expected to be effective:\n\n  * Obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency with _POMC_ , _PCSK1_ or _LEPR_ variants classified as benign or likely benign.\n  * Other types of obesity not related to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, or BBS, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity.\n\n\n\n**Contraindication** Prior serious hypersensitivity to setmelanotide or any of the excipients in IMCIVREE. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported.\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi** : Generalized increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi have occurred because of its pharmacologic effect. Full body skin examinations prior to initiation and periodically during treatment should be conducted to monitor pre-existing and new pigmentary lesions.\n\n**Heart rate and blood pressure monitoring:** In Europe, heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored as part of standard clinical practice at each medical visit (at least every 6 months) for patients treated with setmelanotide.\n\n**Disturbance in Sexual Arousal:** Spontaneous penile erections in males and sexual adverse reactions in females have occurred. Patients who have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours should seek emergency medical attention.\n\n**Depression and Suicidal Ideation** : Depression and suicidal ideation have occurred. Patients should be monitored for new onset or worsening depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Consideration should be given to discontinuing setmelanotide if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors, or clinically significant or persistent depression symptoms occur.\n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions** : Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. If suspected, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue setmelanotide.\n\n**Pediatric Population:** The prescribing physician should periodically assess response to setmelanotide therapy. In growing children, the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation should be evaluated. In Europe, the prescribing physician should monitor growth (height and weight) using age- and sex-appropriate growth curves.\n\n**Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in Neonates and Low Birth Weight Infants:** Setmelanotide is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS** Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) included skin hyperpigmentation, injection site reactions, nausea, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, depression, and spontaneous penile erection.\n\n**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n**Lactation:** Not recommended when breastfeeding.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhythm Pharmaceuticals at +1 (833) 789-6337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](http://www.fda.gov/medwatch).

(Nasdaq: RYTM), a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases, today announced the publication of results from its Phase 3 VENTURE trial evaluating setmelanotide, a melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist, in children between the ages of 2 and younger than 5 years old with Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) or pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency. The data are published in the peer-reviewed journal [ _The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vdsMhN7pa07g6TgIzqj5oA10azcR11aFxray32vDOc1Je9SaXY8VZisHobBOH837R0Ip5Cxb5XYn5XSA453GgqT01E-iZSMSrwIMRY75oYAw1SPCG1jPLSG0QreaBGuhHqYPIo2UfcaOEqqD9bQlWXvP0b3XAafF4z4eXAUjfOn9ga4eQPMr84Xr_nipQ87ncpz01P05bL12FHWI9dAwtg==).\n\n“Severe, early-onset obesity has been shown to have a negative short-term and long-term impact on a child’s health,” said Professor Jesús Argente, M.D., Ph.D., Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Endocrinology, Hospital Infantil Universitario Niño Jesús and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. “In this study, setmelanotide demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in hunger and body weight in patients younger than 5 years of age with severe obesity. We believe these data support the use of this targeted therapy in a patient population that could benefit from intervention as early as possible.”\n\nRhythm enrolled 12 patients in its open-label 52-week Phase 3 VENTURE trial designed to evaluate setmelanotide in patients aged 2 to younger than 6 years with BBS or POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency. Clinically meaningful improvements were observed in both co-primary endpoints at week 52. Results of the trial demonstrated:\n\n  * 10 of 12 patients (83%)1 achieved ≥0.2-point reduction in body mass index (BMI) Z-score;\n  * -18% in mean percent change in BMI from baseline;\n  * 91% of caregivers reported patients had reduced hunger compared with baseline, and the caregivers also reported feelings of reduced personal burden; and\n  * No new safety signals were observed.\n\n\n\nConsistent with prior experience, setmelanotide was observed to have been generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events (AEs) leading to study discontinuation or death were reported. The most common treatment-emergent AEs were skin hyperpigmentation (75%), vomiting (58%), nasopharyngitis (42%), upper respiratory tract infection (33%), and injection site bruising (33%).\n\nIn July 2024, IMCIVREE (setmelanotide) received authorization as the first-ever precision medicine in the European Union for control of hunger and treatment of obesity in adults and children as young as 2 years old, living with BBS or POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency. In addition, Rhythm has completed submission of its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to expand the label of IMCIVREE to treat pediatric patients between the ages of 2 and younger than 6 years old in approved indications in the United States. The FDA has granted Priority Review of the sNDA and assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of December 26, 2024.\n\n**About Rhythm Pharmaceuticals** Rhythm is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the lives of patients with rare neuroendocrine diseases.

(Nasdaq: RYTM), a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases, today announced that on November 7, 2024, the Compensation & Management Development Committee of Rhythm’s Board of Directors granted inducement restricted stock units, or RSUs, covering an aggregate of 15,750 shares of its common stock to three new employees.\n\nThese inducement RSUs are subject to the terms of the Rhythm Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2022 Employment Inducement Plan (the \"Inducement Plan\"). \n\nThe Inducement Plan is used exclusively for the grant of equity awards to individuals as an inducement material to the employees entering into employment with Rhythm pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4). The Inducement Plan was adopted by Rhythm’s Board of Directors on February 9, 2022. \n\nThe RSUs vest over four years, with 25% of the shares vesting on each anniversary of the applicable date of hire, subject to each such employee’s continued employment on each vesting date. \n\n**About Rhythm Pharmaceuticals** Rhythm is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the lives of patients living with rare neuroendocrine diseases. Rhythm’s lead asset, IMCIVREE® (setmelanotide), an MC4R agonist designed to treat hyperphagia and severe obesity, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1) or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency confirmed by genetic testing, or patients with a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Both the European Commission (EC) and the UK’s Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have authorized setmelanotide for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or genetically confirmed loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. The EC has also authorized setmelanotide for control of hunger and treatment of obesity in children as young as 2 years old, living with BBS or POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency. Additionally, Rhythm is advancing a broad clinical development program for setmelanotide in other rare diseases, as well as investigational MC4R agonists LB54640 and RM-718, and a preclinical suite of small molecules for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism. Rhythm’s headquarters is in Boston, MA.\n\n**Setmelanotide Indication** In the United States, setmelanotide is indicated for chronic weight management in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with monogenic or syndromic obesity due to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency as determined by an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in  _POMC_ ,  _PCSK1_ or  _LEPR_ genes that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain significance (VUS) or BBS.\n\nIn the European Union, setmelanotide is indicated for the treatment of obesity and the control of hunger associated with genetically confirmed BBS or loss-of-function biallelic POMC, including PCSK1, deficiency or biallelic LEPR deficiency in adults and children 6 years of age and above. In Europe, setmelanotide should be prescribed and supervised by a physician with expertise in obesity with underlying genetic etiology.\n\n**Limitations of Use**\n\nSetmelanotide is not indicated for the treatment of patients with the following conditions as setmelanotide would not be expected to be effective:\n\n  * Obesity due to suspected POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency with  _POMC_ ,  _PCSK1_ or  _LEPR_ variants classified as benign or likely benign.\n  * Other types of obesity not related to POMC, PCSK1 or LEPR deficiency, or BBS, including obesity associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity.\n\n\n\n**Contraindication**\n\nPrior serious hypersensitivity to setmelanotide or any of the excipients in IMCIVREE. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported.\n\n**WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS**\n\n**Skin Pigmentation and Darkening of Pre-Existing Nevi:** Generalized increased skin pigmentation and darkening of pre-existing nevi have occurred because of its pharmacologic effect. Full body skin examinations prior to initiation and periodically during treatment should be conducted to monitor pre-existing and new pigmentary lesions.\n\n**Heart rate and blood pressure monitoring:** In Europe, heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored as part of standard clinical practice at each medical visit (at least every 6 months) for patients treated with setmelanotide.\n\n**Disturbance in Sexual Arousal:** Spontaneous penile erections in males and sexual adverse reactions in females have occurred. Patients who have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours should seek emergency medical attention.\n\n**Depression and Suicidal Ideation:** Depression and suicidal ideation have occurred. Patients should be monitored for new onset or worsening depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors. Consideration should be given to discontinuing setmelanotide if patients experience suicidal thoughts or behaviors, or clinically significant or persistent depression symptoms occur.\n\n**Hypersensitivity Reactions:** Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., anaphylaxis) have been reported. If suspected, advise patients to promptly seek medical attention and discontinue setmelanotide.\n\n**Pediatric Population:** The prescribing physician should periodically assess response to setmelanotide therapy. In growing children, the impact of weight loss on growth and maturation should be evaluated. In Europe, the prescribing physician should monitor growth (height and weight) using age- and sex-appropriate growth curves.\n\n**Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions Due to Benzyl Alcohol Preservative in Neonates and Low Birth Weight Infants:** Setmelanotide is not approved for use in neonates or infants. Serious and fatal adverse reactions including “gasping syndrome” can occur in neonates and low birth weight infants treated with benzyl alcohol-preserved drugs.\n\n**ADVERSE REACTIONS**\n\nMost common adverse reactions (incidence ≥20%) included skin hyperpigmentation, injection site reactions, nausea, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, depression, and spontaneous penile erection.\n\n**USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS**\n\n**Lactation:** Not recommended when breastfeeding.\n\nTo report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Rhythm Pharmaceuticals at +1 (833) 789-6337 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or [www.fda.gov/medwatch](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=WVgLNNhdRi8vAVNXIhOjpVX1vzHnDVIiuwA6MHlygYH7MPPikUe8Yxk3QhgnZaSz0OktF0T6Gp2q-AEWPVmA3xDkRIrNVs27l1js3_ow_ho=).
