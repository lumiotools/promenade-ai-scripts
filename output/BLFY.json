Quotes may be obtained by calling your broker, on the Internet, or in a newspaper. \n\n#### \n\nOn what stock exchange(s) is Blue Foundry Bancorp traded and under what symbol?\n\nNASDAQ Global Select Market/BLFY\n\n#### \n\nHow can I purchase or sell Blue Foundry Bancorp’s shares?\n\nShares can be purchased or sold only through a firm offering investment services, such as a brokerage firm.\n\n#### \n\nI am calling from a brokerage firm and would like to receive additional copies of your prospectus. Who can I contact?\n\nPlease contact our Investor Relations department at (888) 931-BLUE or InvestorRelations@bluefoundrybank.com to make this request.\n\n#### \n\nI paid for my order by check. Will I receive an interest check?\n\nYes. As explained in the Prospectus, funds remitted in this manner earned interest at 0.05% per annum calculated from the date your funds were processed through July 15, 2021. Interest checks (and if applicable refund checks) were mailed by our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (“Continental Stock Transfer”), at (877) 634-5370, on July 16, 2021. Checks were sent to the mailing address noted in box #9 on the Stock Order Form.\n\n#### \n\nI paid for my order by authorizing a withdrawal from my Blue Foundry Bank Certificate of Deposit (CD) or Savings Account. Will I receive interest on those funds?\n\nFunds authorized for payment from a Blue Foundry Bank CD or savings account, based on the shares you received, were withdrawn from the account(s) on July 15, 2021, the legal close of the transaction. The amount(s) authorized for withdrawal toward your purchase therefore earned interest at the applicable deposit account rate through the legal close. The interest remains in the account(s).\n\n#### \n\nI USED MY BLUE FOUNDRY BANK CD ACCOUNT TO PAY FOR MY SHARES AND PURSUANT TO THE WITHDRAWAL TO PAY FOR THE SHARES MY CD WILL FALL BELOW THE REQUIRED MINIMUM. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CD AND WAS I CHARGED AN EARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTY? \n\nThere was no early withdrawal penalty from CDs to purchase stock. If the CD fell below the minimum balance, after withdrawal, the certificate will be canceled and the remaining balance will earn interest at the current passbook rate.\n\n#### \n\nDID EVERYONE GET ALL THE SHARES THEY SUBSCRIBED FOR?\n\nNo. The stock offering was oversubscribed by eligible depositors as of December 2019. No shares were sold to other subscribers in the Subscription Offering. \n\n#### \n\nWAS THERE A COMMUNITY OFFERING?\n\nNo. There was no Community, Syndicated or Firm Commitment public offering.\n\n#### \n\nWHEN WILL DIRECT REGISTRATION STATEMENTS (AKA STOCK OWNERSHIP STATEMENTS) BE MAILED? \n\nAll direct registration statements for purchasers in the stock offering were sent First Class mail on July 16, 2021. The statements were mailed by Continental Stock Transfer, our transfer agent.\n\n#### \n\nI PURCHASED SHARES IN THE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERING, HOWEVER, I DID NOT RECEIVE MY STOCK OWNERSHIP STATEMENT. WHO CAN I CONTACT? \n\nPlease call our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer at (877) 634-5370 for assistance.\n\n#### \n\nI PURCHASED SHARES IN THE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERING, HOWEVER, I DID NOT RECEIVE MY INTEREST CHECK. WHO CAN I CONTACT? \n\n  1. If your order was paid for by check - please call Continental Stock Transfer at (877) 634-5370 for assistance. \n  2.
