(\"Denny's\") and Keke's Inc. (\"Keke's\") today reported results for its third quarter ended September 25, 2024 and provided a business update on the Company’s operations.\n\nKelli Valade, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our third quarter sales results directly reflect ongoing brand investments and dedicated focus on value that resulted in outpacing the category. Denny’s domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales** outperformed the BBI Family Dining index for the third consecutive quarter driven by the relaunch of our fan favorite $2-$4-$6-$8 value menu and the continued expansion of off-premises with our third virtual brand, Banda Burrito. Keke’s also experienced significant sequential improvement in same-restaurant sales** as our initiatives to enact foundational marketing strategies and expand the alcohol program continued our efforts to close the gap to the competitive set. We are also very excited to be hosting an Investor Day today.”\n\nBeginning at 9:00am EST this morning, the Company will be hosting an Investor Day in New York, as well as a live webcast, to detail strategic initiatives to build on its third quarter progress and ensure long-term financial opportunities for its brands. The investor day will highlight the Company’s plan to grow average unit volume sales, margins and the portfolio, while balancing capital allocations to maximize shareholder returns.\n\n**Third****Quarter****2024****Highlights****(1)**\n\n  * Total operating revenue was $111.8 million compared to $114.2 million for the prior year quarter.\n  * Denny's domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales** were (0.1%) compared to the equivalent fiscal period in 2023, including (0.1%) at domestic franchised restaurants and (0.4%) at company restaurants.\n  * Opened two Denny's domestic franchised restaurants.\n  * Completed six Denny's remodels, including three company remodels.\n  * Operating income was $11.7 million compared to $14.0 million for the prior year quarter.\n  * Adjusted franchise operating margin* was $30.1 million, or 51.0% of franchise and license revenue, and Adjusted company restaurant operating margin* was $6.2 million, or 11.8% of company restaurant sales.\n  * Net income was $6.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted net income* and adjusted net income per share* were $7.2 million and $0.14, respectively.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* was $20.0 million.\n\n\n\n(1) Beginning fiscal 2024, the Company has evolved its definition of non-GAAP measures. Please see the definitions, explanations, and reconciliations further in this release.\n\n**Third****Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal operating revenue was $111.8 million compared to $114.2 million for the prior year quarter.\n\nFranchise and license revenue was $59.1 million compared to $61.0 million for the prior year quarter. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in initial and other fees associated with the sale of kitchen equipment in the prior year quarter, and decreases in equivalent units and franchise occupancy revenue, partially offset by an increase in franchise advertising revenue primarily related to higher local advertising co-op contributions for the current quarter.\n\nCompany restaurant sales were $52.7 million compared to $53.2 million for the prior year quarter primarily driven by four fewer Denny's equivalent units, including three refranchised units, partially offset by three additional Keke's equivalent units for the current quarter.\n\nAdjusted franchise operating margin* was $30.1 million, or 51.0% of franchise and license revenue, compared to $31.1 million, or 51.0% for the prior year quarter. This margin change was primarily driven by the impact of fewer equivalent units on royalty revenues and lease terminations.\n\nAdjusted company restaurant operating margin* was $6.2 million, or 11.8% of company restaurant sales, compared to $7.6 million, or 14.3% for the prior year quarter. This margin change was primarily due to investments in marketing and higher occupancy costs, including general liability insurance costs, for the current quarter.\n\nTotal general and administrative expenses were $19.8 million compared to $18.2 million in the prior year quarter. This change was primarily due to an increase in corporate administration expense.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 18.5% for the current quarter.\n\nNet income was $6.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted net income* per share was $0.14.\n\nThe Company ended the quarter with $272.0 million of total debt outstanding, including $261.0 million of borrowings under its credit facility.\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nThe Company invested $7.8 million in cash capital expenditures, which included Keke's new development and Denny's company remodels.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company allocated $1.8 million to share repurchases resulting in approximately $89.2 million remaining under its existing repurchase authorization.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe following full year 2024 expectations reflect management's expectations that the current consumer and economic environment will not change materially, as well as the Company's strategic initiative to accelerate the closure of lower volume Denny's restaurants.\n\n  * Denny's domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales _**_ between (1%) and 0% (vs. between (1%) and 1%).\n  * Consolidated restaurant openings of 30 to 40, including 12 to 16 new Keke's restaurants, with a consolidated net decline of 45 to 55 (vs. 20 to 30).\n  * Commodity inflation of approximately 2% (vs. between 0% and 2%).\n  * Labor inflation between 3% and 4%.\n  * Total general and administrative expenses between $82 million and $85 million, including approximately $11 million related to share-based compensation expense which does not impact Adjusted EBITDA*.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _*_ between $81 million and $84 million (vs. between $83 million and $87 million).\n\n_*_ |  _Please refer to the Reconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Financial Measures, as well as the Reconciliation of Operating Income to Non-GAAP Financial Measures included in the tables below. The Company is not able to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP estimate set forth above to its most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) estimates without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict, forecast or determine the probable significance of the items impacting these estimates, including gains, losses and other charges, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Accordingly, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP estimate is not provided._  \n---|---  \n**| _Same-restaurant sales include sales at company restaurants and non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open during the comparable periods noted. Total operating revenue is limited to company restaurant sales and royalties, advertising revenue, initial and other fees and occupancy revenue from non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants. Accordingly, domestic franchise same-restaurant sales and domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the Company's results as reported under GAAP._  \n  \n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nThe Company will provide further commentary on the results for the third quarter ended September 25, 2024 and its investor day on a webcast today, Tuesday, October 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Interested parties are invited to listen to the webcast accessible through the Company's investor relations website at [investor.dennys.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=0BJlQxYyVoD6quj-1ToUNxH6rqbpHwnIgKvs08NxiVS_ZaxFy-eWQU3Vx15c2vo-O9YvyUifmrwJJmj-T0oBsDVNTz2y0AdHDYyluYE78iUQZDZhm-DIQQ5c4nkeCspx).\n\n**About Denny's Corporation**\n\nDenny’s Corporation is one of America’s largest full-service restaurant chains based on number of restaurants. As of September 25, 2024, the Company consisted of 1,586 restaurants, 1,514 of which were franchised and licensed restaurants and 72 of which were company operated.\n\nThe Company consists of the Denny’s brand and the Keke’s brand. As of September 25, 2024, the Denny's brand consisted of 1,525 global restaurants, 1,464 of which were franchised and licensed restaurants and 61 of which were company operated.

Denny's Corporation management uses certain non-GAAP measures in analyzing operating performance and believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors and analysts with information that is beneficial to gaining an understanding of the Company's financial results. Non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company excludes legal settlement expenses, pre-opening expenses, and other items management does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance from adjusted operating margin*, adjusted net income*, adjusted net income per share*, and adjusted EBITDA*. In addition, the Company no longer deducts cash payments for restructuring and exit costs, or cash payments for share-based compensation from Adjusted EBITDA*. Lastly, the Company has transitioned to utilizing GAAP cash flows included in its SEC filed documents in lieu of a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are included in the tables of this press release and a recast of historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Company's website, or its most recent investor presentation.\n\n**_Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_The Company urges caution in considering its current trends and any outlook on earnings disclosed in this press release. In addition, certain matters discussed in this release may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known, are intended to speak only as of the date such statements are made and involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual performance of Denny’s Corporation, its subsidiaries, and underlying restaurants to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements.

Except as may be required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Factors that could cause actual performance to differ materially from the performance indicated by these forward-looking statements include, among others: economic, public health and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending, commodity and labor inflation; the ability to effectively staff restaurants and support personnel; the Company's ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity for its cash needs, including debt obligations, payment of dividends, planned share repurchases and capital expenditures as well as the ability of its customers, suppliers, franchisees and lenders to access sources of liquidity to provide for their own cash needs; competitive pressures from within the restaurant industry; the Company's ability to integrate and derive the expected benefits from its acquisition of Keke's Breakfast Cafe; the level of success of the Company’s operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts; adverse publicity; health concerns arising from food-related pandemics, outbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases; changes in business strategy or development plans; terms and availability of capital; regional weather conditions; overall changes in the general economy (including with regard to energy costs), particularly at the retail level; political environment and geopolitical events (including acts of war and terrorism); and other factors from time to time set forth in the Company’s SEC reports and other filings, including but not limited to the discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the risks identified in Item 1A.

However, non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and net income per share, or other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses restaurant-level operating margin, company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin internally as performance measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets, and for compensation purposes, including incentive compensation for certain employees.\n\nRestaurant-level operating margin is the total of company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin and excludes: (i) general and administrative expenses, which include primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of company and franchised restaurants and other activities at their corporate office; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to company restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants; (iii) special items, included within operating (gains), losses and other charges, net, to provide investors with a clearer perspective of its ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results.\n\nCompany restaurant operating margin is defined as company restaurant sales less costs of company restaurant sales (which include product costs, company restaurant level payroll and benefits, occupancy costs, and other operating costs including utilities, repairs and maintenance, marketing and other expenses) and presents it as a percent of company restaurant sales. Adjusted company operating restaurant margin is defined as company restaurant operating margin less certain items such as legal settlement expenses, pre-opening expenses, and other items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.\n\nFranchise operating margin is defined as franchise and license revenue (which includes franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams such as initial franchise and other fees, advertising revenue and occupancy revenue) less costs of franchise and license revenue and presents it as a percent of franchise and license revenue. Adjusted franchise operating margin is defined as franchise operating margin less certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.\n\nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin is the total of adjusted company restaurant operating margin and adjusted franchise operating margin and is defined as restaurant-level operating margin adjusted for certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance. These adjustments are either non-recurring in nature or vary from period to period without correlation to the Company's ongoing core operating performance.\n\nQuarter Ended| Three Quarters Ended  \n---|---  \n($ in thousands)| 9/25/24| 9/27/23| 9/25/24| 9/27/23  \nOperating income| $| 11,741| $| 14,018| $| 30,862| $| 45,099  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 19,831| 18,237| 61,539| 58,515  \nDepreciation and amortization| 3,622| 3,605| 10,938| 10,878  \nGoodwill impairment charges| —| —| 20| —  \nOperating (gains), losses and other charges, net| 746| 2,620| 1,984| 2,467  \nRestaurant-level operating margin| $| 35,940| $| 38,480| $| 105,343| $| 116,959  \nRestaurant-level operating margin consists of:  \nCompany restaurant operating margin (1)| $| 5,881| $| 7,260| $| 16,875| $| 22,533  \nFranchise operating margin (2)| 30,059| 31,220| 88,468| 94,426  \nRestaurant-level operating margin| $| 35,940| $| 38,480| $| 105,343| $| 116,959  \nAdjustments (3)| 401| 272| 5,107| 530  \nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin| $| 36,341| $| 38,752| $| 110,450| $| 117,489  \n(1| )| Company restaurant operating margin is calculated as operating income plus general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization; operating (gains), losses and other charges, net; and costs of franchise and license revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization; less franchise and license revenue.  \n---|---|---  \n(2| )| Franchise operating margin is calculated as operating income plus general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization; operating (gains), losses and other charges, net; and costs of company restaurant sales, excluding depreciation and amortization; less company restaurant sales.  \n(3| )| Adjustments include legal settlement expenses, pre-opening costs, and other adjustments the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.

(\"Denny's\") and Keke's Inc. (\"Keke's\") today reported results for its second quarter ended June 26, 2024 and provided a business update on the Company’s operations.\n\nKelli Valade, Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"I am very pleased that for the second quarter in a row Denny's outperformed BBI Family Dining same-restaurant sales, and Keke's continued to close the gap in Florida all while navigating a very competitive environment. We are also encouraged to see these trends continuing into July, which is being bolstered by our incremental advertising investments and the expansion of our third virtual brand. Additionally, we opened our second Keke's cafe in Tennessee, as well as completed our first remodel test at our highest volume Keke's corporate location. Despite these results and staying ahead of the competition, we know the overall industry is pressured and therefore we have updated our guidance accordingly and remain confident in our strategies and initiatives.”\n\n**Second****Quarter****2024****Highlights****(1)**\n\n  * Total operating revenue was $115.9 million compared to $116.9 million for the prior year quarter.\n  * Denny's domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales** were (0.6%) compared to the equivalent fiscal period in 2023, including (0.4%) at domestic franchised restaurants and (2.6%) at company restaurants.\n  * Opened four restaurants, including one Keke's company location.\n  * Operating income was $9.1 million compared to $14.9 million for the prior year quarter.\n  * Adjusted franchise operating margin* was $30.8 million, or 50.0% of franchise and license revenue, and Adjusted company restaurant operating margin* was $7.2 million, or 13.2% of company restaurant sales.\n  * Net income was $3.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share.\n  * Adjusted net income* and adjusted net income per share* were $6.9 million and $0.13, respectively.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA* was $20.3 million.\n\n\n\n(1) Beginning fiscal 2024, the Company has evolved its definition of non-GAAP measures. Please see the definitions, explanations, and reconciliations further in this release.\n\n**Second****Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal operating revenue was $115.9 million compared to $116.9 million for the prior year quarter.\n\nFranchise and license revenue was $61.6 million compared to $62.0 million for the prior year quarter. This change was driven by decreases in franchise occupancy revenue and franchise sales, partially offset by an increase in franchise advertising revenue primarily related to higher local advertising co-op contributions for the current quarter.\n\nCompany restaurant sales were $54.3 million compared to $54.9 million for the prior year quarter primarily driven by a decrease in same-restaurant sales, partially offset by three additional Keke's equivalent units for the current quarter.\n\nAdjusted franchise operating margin* was $30.8 million, or 50.0% of franchise and license revenue, compared to $31.6 million, or 50.9% for the prior year quarter. This margin change was primarily driven by the impact of lower sales on royalty and advertising revenues and lease terminations.\n\nAdjusted company restaurant operating margin* was $7.2 million, or 13.2% of company restaurant sales, compared to $8.5 million, or 15.4% for the prior year quarter. This margin change was primarily due to a decrease in same-restaurant sales and increases in marketing and general liability insurance costs for the current quarter.\n\nTotal general and administrative expenses were $20.5 million compared to $20.2 million in the prior year quarter. This change was primarily due to an increase in corporate administration expense.\n\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the current quarter.\n\nNet income was $3.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Adjusted net income* per share was $0.13.\n\nThe Company ended the quarter with $267.4 million of total debt outstanding, including $257.5 million of borrowings under its credit facility.\n\n**Capital Allocation**\n\nThe Company invested $5.0 million in cash capital expenditures, primarily related to Keke's development.\n\nDuring the quarter, the Company allocated $4.7 million to share repurchases resulting in approximately $91.0 million remaining under its existing repurchase authorization.\n\n**Business Outlook**\n\nThe following full year 2024 expectations reflect management's expectations that the current consumer and economic environment will not change materially.\n\n  * Denny's domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales _**_ between (1%) and 1% (vs. between 0% and 3%).\n  * Consolidated restaurant openings of 30 to 40 (vs. 40 to 50), including 12 to 16 new Keke's restaurants, with a consolidated net decline of 20 to 30 (vs. 10 to 20).\n  * Commodity inflation between 0% and 2%.\n  * Labor inflation between 3% and 4% (vs. between 4% and 5%).\n  * Total general and administrative expenses between $82 million and $85 million (vs. between $83 million and $86 million), including approximately $11 million (vs. $12 million) related to share-based compensation expense which does not impact Adjusted EBITDA*.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA _*_ between $83 million and $87 million (vs. between $87 million and $91 million).\n\n\n\n_*_  _Please refer to the Reconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Financial Measures, as well as the Reconciliation of Operating Income to Non-GAAP Financial Measures included in the tables below. The Company is not able to reconcile the forward-looking non-GAAP estimate set forth above to its most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) estimates without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict, forecast or determine the probable significance of the items impacting these estimates, including gains, losses and other charges, with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Accordingly, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP estimate is not provided._\n\n**  _Same-restaurant sales include sales at company restaurants and non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that were open during the comparable periods noted. Total operating revenue is limited to company restaurant sales and royalties, advertising revenue, initial and other fees and occupancy revenue from non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants. Accordingly, domestic franchise same-restaurant sales and domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the Company's results as reported under GAAP._\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nThe Company will provide further commentary on the results for the second quarter ended June 26, 2024 on its quarterly investor conference call today, Tuesday, July 30, 2024 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Interested parties are invited to listen to a live broadcast of the conference call accessible through the Company's investor relations website at [investor.dennys.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=n2Sa91-nTPXvVJEyVj45laH28jW7tPUj2wLfswkUQa0A4fGEgf8bdc0aIEmfymkehtwlr0RA5JOa44XvxqadAjT7cU1KAVTkcetFXXMdACBArjT8-QvnRz0WgVZBFgF5).\n\n**About Denny's Corporation**\n\nDenny’s Corporation is one of America’s largest full-service restaurant chains based on number of restaurants.

Denny's Corporation management uses certain non-GAAP measures in analyzing operating performance and believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors and analysts with information that is beneficial to gaining an understanding of the Company's financial results. Non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nThe Company will begin excluding legal settlement expenses, pre-opening expenses, and other items management does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance from adjusted operating margin*, adjusted net income*, adjusted net income per share*, and adjusted EBITDA*. In addition, the Company will no longer deduct cash payments for restructuring and exit costs, or cash payments for share-based compensation from adjusted EBITDA*. Lastly, the Company will transition to utilizing GAAP cash flows included in its SEC filed documents in lieu of a non-GAAP financial measure.\n\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are included in the tables of this press release and a recast of historical non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Company's website, or its most recent investor presentation.\n\n**_Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements_**\n\n_The Company urges caution in considering its current trends and any outlook on earnings disclosed in this press release. In addition, certain matters discussed in this release may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known, are intended to speak only as of the date such statements are made and involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual performance of Denny’s Corporation, its subsidiaries, and underlying restaurants to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements.

However, non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and net income per share, or other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses restaurant-level operating margin, company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin internally as performance measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets, and for compensation purposes, including incentive compensation for certain employees.\n\nRestaurant-level operating margin is the total of company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin and excludes: (i) general and administrative expenses, which include primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of company and franchised restaurants and other activities at their corporate office; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to company restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants; (iii) special items, included within operating (gains), losses and other charges, net, to provide investors with a clearer perspective of its ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results.\n\nCompany restaurant operating margin is defined as company restaurant sales less costs of company restaurant sales (which include product costs, company restaurant level payroll and benefits, occupancy costs, and other operating costs including utilities, repairs and maintenance, marketing and other expenses) and presents it as a percent of company restaurant sales. Adjusted company operating restaurant margin is defined as company restaurant operating margin less certain items such as legal settlement expenses, pre-opening expenses, and other items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.\n\nFranchise operating margin is defined as franchise and license revenue (which includes franchise royalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams such as initial franchise and other fees, advertising revenue and occupancy revenue) less costs of franchise and license revenue and presents it as a percent of franchise and license revenue. Adjusted franchise operating margin is defined as franchise operating margin less certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.\n\nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin is the total of adjusted company restaurant operating margin and adjusted franchise operating margin and is defined as restaurant-level operating margin adjusted for certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance. These adjustments are either non-recurring in nature or vary from period to period without correlation to the Company's ongoing core operating performance.\n\nQuarter Ended| Two Quarters Ended  \n---|---  \n($ in thousands)| 6/26/24| 6/28/23| 6/26/24| 6/28/23  \nOperating income| $| 9,115| $| 14,934| $| 19,121| $| 31,081  \nGeneral and administrative expenses| 20,486| 20,160| 41,708| 40,278  \nDepreciation and amortization| 3,735| 3,617| 7,316| 7,273  \nGoodwill impairment charges| 20| —| 20| —  \nOperating (gains), losses and other charges, net| 1,565| 1,176| 1,238| (153| )  \nRestaurant-level operating margin| $| 34,921| $| 39,887| $| 69,403| $| 78,479  \nRestaurant-level operating margin consists of:  \nCompany restaurant operating margin (1)| $| 6,770| $| 8,313| $| 10,994| $| 15,273  \nFranchise operating margin (2)| 28,151| 31,574| 58,409| 63,206  \nRestaurant-level operating margin| $| 34,921| $| 39,887| $| 69,403| $| 78,479  \nAdjustments (3)| 3,039| 157| 4,706| 258  \nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin| $| 37,960| $| 40,044| $| 74,109| $| 78,737  \n(1)| Company restaurant operating margin is calculated as operating income plus general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization; operating (gains), losses and other charges, net; and costs of franchise and license revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization; less franchise and license revenue.   \n---|---  \n(2)| Franchise operating margin is calculated as operating income plus general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization; operating (gains), losses and other charges, net; and costs of company restaurant sales, excluding depreciation and amortization; less company restaurant sales.   \n(3)| Adjustments include legal settlement expenses, pre-opening costs, and other adjustments the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.

(\"Denny's\") and Keke's Inc. (\"Keke's\") today reported results for its third\nquarter ended September 25, 2024 and provided a business update on the Company’s operations.\nKelli Valade, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our third quarter sales results directly reflect ongoing brand\ninvestments and dedicated focus on value that resulted in outpacing the category. Denny’s domestic system-\nwide same-restaurant sales** outperformed the BBI Family Dining index for the third consecutive quarter\ndriven by the relaunch of our fan favorite $2-$4-$6-$8 value menu and the continued expansion of off-premises\nwith our third virtual brand, Banda Burrito. Keke’s also experienced significant sequential improvement in\nsame-restaurant sales** as our initiatives to enact foundational marketing strategies and expand the alcohol\nprogram continued our efforts to close the gap to the competitive set. We are also very excited to be hosting an\nInvestor Day today.”\nBeginning at 9:00am EST this morning, the Company will be hosting an Investor Day in New York, as well as a\nlive webcast, to detail strategic initiatives to build on its third quarter progress and ensure long-term financial\nopportunities for its brands. The investor day will highlight the Company’s plan to grow average unit volume\nsales, margins and the portfolio, while balancing capital allocations to maximize shareholder returns.\nThird Quarter 2024 Highlights(1)\n• Total operating revenue was $111.8 million compared to $114.2 million for the prior year quarter.\n• Denny's domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales** were (0.1%) compared to the equivalent fiscal\nperiod in 2023, including (0.1%) at domestic franchised restaurants and (0.4%) at company restaurants.\n• Opened two Denny's domestic franchised restaurants.\n• Completed six Denny's remodels, including three company remodels.\n• Operating income was $11.7 million compared to $14.0 million for the prior year quarter.\n• Adjusted franchise operating margin* was $30.1 million, or 51.0% of franchise and license revenue, and\nAdjusted company restaurant operating margin* was $6.2 million, or 11.8% of company restaurant sales.\n• Net income was $6.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share.\n• Adjusted net income* and adjusted net income per share* were $7.2 million and $0.14, respectively.\n• Adjusted EBITDA* was $20.0 million.\n(1)\nBeginning fiscal 2024, the Company has evolved its definition of non-GAAP measures. Please see the definitions, explanations,\nand reconciliations further in this release.\n1\nThird Quarter 2024 Results\nTotal operating revenue was $111.8 million compared to $114.2 million for the prior year quarter.\nFranchise and license revenue was $59.1 million compared to $61.0 million for the prior year quarter. This\nchange was primarily driven by a decrease in initial and other fees associated with the sale of kitchen equipment\nin the prior year quarter, and decreases in equivalent units and franchise occupancy revenue, partially offset by\nan increase in franchise advertising revenue primarily related to higher local advertising co-op contributions for\nthe current quarter.\nCompany restaurant sales were $52.7 million compared to $53.2 million for the prior year quarter primarily\ndriven by four fewer Denny's equivalent units, including three refranchised units, partially offset by three\nadditional Keke's equivalent units for the current quarter.\nAdjusted franchise operating margin* was $30.1 million, or 51.0% of franchise and license revenue, compared\nto $31.1 million, or 51.0% for the prior year quarter. This margin change was primarily driven by the impact of\nfewer equivalent units on royalty revenues and lease terminations.\nAdjusted company restaurant operating margin* was $6.2 million, or 11.8% of company restaurant sales,\ncompared to $7.6 million, or 14.3% for the prior year quarter. This margin change was primarily due to\ninvestments in marketing and higher occupancy costs, including general liability insurance costs, for the current\nquarter.\nTotal general and administrative expenses were $19.8 million compared to $18.2 million in the prior year\nquarter. This change was primarily due to an increase in corporate administration expense.\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.5 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 18.5% for the current\nquarter.\nNet income was $6.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Adjusted net income* per share was $0.14.\nThe Company ended the quarter with $272.0 million of total debt outstanding, including $261.0 million of\nborrowings under its credit facility.\nCapital Allocation\nThe Company invested $7.8 million in cash capital expenditures, which included Keke's new development and\nDenny's company remodels.\nDuring the quarter, the Company allocated $1.8 million to share repurchases resulting in approximately $89.2\nmillion remaining under its existing repurchase authorization.\n2\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following full year 2024 expectations reflect management's expectations that the current consumer and\neconomic environment will not change materially, as well as the Company's strategic initiative to accelerate the\nclosure of lower volume Denny's restaurants.\n• Denny's domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales** between (1%) and 0% (vs. between (1%) and 1%).\n• Consolidated restaurant openings of 30 to 40, including 12 to 16 new Keke's restaurants, with a\nconsolidated net decline of 45 to 55 (vs. 20 to 30).\n• Commodity inflation of approximately 2% (vs. between 0% and 2%).\n• Labor inflation between 3% and 4%.\n• Total general and administrative expenses between $82 million and $85 million, including approximately\n$11 million related to share-based compensation expense which does not impact Adjusted EBITDA*.\n• Adjusted EBITDA* between $81 million and $84 million (vs. between $83 million and $87 million).\n* Please refer to the Reconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Financial Measures, as well as the Reconciliation of Operating\nIncome to Non-GAAP Financial Measures included in the tables below. The Company is not able to reconcile the forward-\nlooking non-GAAP estimate set forth above to its most directly comparable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP) estimates without unreasonable efforts because it is unable to predict, forecast or determine the probable significance\nof the items impacting these estimates, including gains, losses and other charges, with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\nAccordingly, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP estimate is not provided.\n** Same-restaurant sales include sales at company restaurants and non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants that\nwere open during the comparable periods noted. Total operating revenue is limited to company restaurant sales and royalties,\nadvertising revenue, initial and other fees and occupancy revenue from non-consolidated franchised and licensed restaurants.\nAccordingly, domestic franchise same-restaurant sales and domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales should be considered\nas a supplement to, not a substitute for, the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company will provide further commentary on the results for the third quarter ended September 25, 2024\nand its investor day on a webcast today, Tuesday, October 22, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Interested parties\nare invited to listen to the webcast accessible through the Company's investor relations website at\ninvestor.dennys.com.\nAbout Denny's Corporation\nDenny’s Corporation is one of America’s largest full-service restaurant chains based on number of restaurants.\nAs of September 25, 2024, the Company consisted of 1,586 restaurants, 1,514 of which were franchised and\nlicensed restaurants and 72 of which were company operated.\nThe Company consists of the Denny’s brand and the Keke’s brand. As of September 25, 2024, the Denny's\nbrand consisted of 1,525 global restaurants, 1,464 of which were franchised and licensed restaurants and 61 of\nwhich were company operated.

Denny's Corporation management uses certain non-GAAP\nmeasures in analyzing operating performance and believes that the presentation of these measures provides\ninvestors and analysts with information that is beneficial to gaining an understanding of the Company's\nfinancial results. Non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in\naccordance with GAAP.\nThe Company excludes legal settlement expenses, pre-opening expenses, and other items management does not\nconsider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance from adjusted operating margin*, adjusted\nnet income*, adjusted net income per share*, and adjusted EBITDA*. In addition, the Company no longer\ndeducts cash payments for restructuring and exit costs, or cash payments for share-based compensation from\nAdjusted EBITDA*. Lastly, the Company has transitioned to utilizing GAAP cash flows included in its SEC\nfiled documents in lieu of a non-GAAP financial measure.\nReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are included in the tables of this press release and a recast of\nhistorical non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Company's website, or its most recent investor\npresentation.\n4\nCautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Company urges caution in considering its current trends and any outlook on earnings disclosed in this press release.\nIn addition, certain matters discussed in this release may constitute forward-looking statements.

However, non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, operating income, net income,\nand net income per share, or other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses restaurant-\nlevel operating margin, company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin internally as performance measures for\nplanning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets, and for compensation purposes, including incentive\ncompensation for certain employees.\nRestaurant-level operating margin is the total of company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin and excludes: (i)\ngeneral and administrative expenses, which include primarily non-restaurant-level costs associated with support of company and\nfranchised restaurants and other activities at their corporate office; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which\nis related to company restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash\noutlays for the restaurants; (iii) special items, included within operating (gains), losses and other charges, net, to provide investors with a\nclearer perspective of its ongoing operating performance and a more relevant comparison to prior period results.\nCompany restaurant operating margin is defined as company restaurant sales less costs of company restaurant sales (which include\nproduct costs, company restaurant level payroll and benefits, occupancy costs, and other operating costs including utilities, repairs and\nmaintenance, marketing and other expenses) and presents it as a percent of company restaurant sales. Adjusted company operating\nrestaurant margin is defined as company restaurant operating margin less certain items such as legal settlement expenses, pre-opening\nexpenses, and other items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.\nFranchise operating margin is defined as franchise and license revenue (which includes franchise royalties and other non-food and\nbeverage revenue streams such as initial franchise and other fees, advertising revenue and occupancy revenue) less costs of franchise and\nlicense revenue and presents it as a percent of franchise and license revenue. Adjusted franchise operating margin is defined as franchise\noperating margin less certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance.\nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin is the total of adjusted company restaurant operating margin and adjusted franchise operating\nmargin and is defined as restaurant-level operating margin adjusted for certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of\nits ongoing core operating performance.

Financial Statements\n(Unaudited)\nNote 1. Introduction and Basis of Presentation\nIntroduction\nDenny’s Corporation, or the Company, is one of America’s largest full-service restaurant chains based on number of restaurants. As of September 25, 2024, the\nCompany consisted of 1,586 restaurants, 1,514 of which were franchised/licensed restaurants and 72 of which were company operated.\nThe Company consists of the Denny’s brand (\"Denny's\") and the Keke’s Breakfast Café brand (“Keke’s”). As of September 25, 2024, the Denny's brand\nconsisted of 1,525 restaurants, 1,464 of which were franchised/licensed restaurants and 61 of which were company operated. As of September 25, 2024, the\nKeke's brand consisted of 61 restaurants, 50 of which were franchised restaurants and 11 of which were company operated.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for\ninterim financial information. Therefore, certain information and notes normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) have been omitted. In our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods\npresented have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make\nestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nActual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe that our estimates are reasonable.\nThese interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the\nfiscal year ended December 27, 2023 which are contained in our audited Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2023. The results\nof operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire fiscal year ending December 25, 2024. Our significant\ninterim accounting policies include the recognition of advertising and marketing costs, generally in proportion to revenue, and the recognition of income taxes\nusing an estimated annual effective rate.\nChange in Presentation\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the 2023 interim consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2024 presentation. These reclassifications did\nnot affect total revenues or net income.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNewly Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial\nReporting”, which was later clarified in January 2021 by ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope”. Additionally, in December 2022, the\nFASB issued ASU 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848”, which allows ASU 2020-04 to be adopted and\napplied prospectively to contract modifications made on or before December 31, 2024. The guidance provides optional guidance, for a limited time, to ease the\npotential burden in accounting for or recognizing the effects of reference rate reform on financial reporting. The Company adopted ASU 2020-04 on March 12,\n2020. The adoption of and future elections under this new guidance did not and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations. The guidance is effective through December 31, 2024.\n9\nAccounting Standards to be Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”. The new guidance\nrequires enhanced reportable segment disclosures to include significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023 (our fiscal 2024) and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024 (our fiscal 2025). We are currently evaluating the impact that the\nadoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and will add necessary disclosures upon adoption.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. The new guidance requires\nenhanced effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024\n(our fiscal 2025). We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and will add\nnecessary disclosures upon adoption.\nWe reviewed all other newly issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they are either not applicable to our business or are not expected to have a\nmaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements as a result of future adoption.\nNote 3. Receivables\nReceivables consisted of the following:\nSeptember 25, 2024 December 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nReceivables, net:\nTrade accounts receivable from franchisees $ 12,363 $ 14,092\nNotes and loan receivables from franchisees 235 584\nVendor receivables 1,941 4,059\nCredit card receivables 657 995\nOther 2,402 1,862\nAllowance for credit losses (560) (201)\nTotal receivables, net $ 17,038 $ 21,391\nNote 4.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:\nQuoted Prices in\nActive Markets for Significant\nIdentical Significant Other Unobservable\nAssets/Liabilities Observable Inputs Inputs\nTotal (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\n(In thousands)\nFair value measurements as of September 25, 2024:\nDeferred compensation plan investments (1) $ 11,063 $ 11,063 $ — $ —\nInterest rate swaps (2) 5,912 — 5,912 —\nInvestments (3) 2,902 — 2,902 —\nTotal $ 19,877 $ 11,063 $ 8,814 $ —\nFair value measurements as of December 27, 2023:\nDeferred compensation plan investments (1) $ 12,225 $ 12,225 $ — $ —\nInterest rate swaps (2) 8,888 — 8,888 —\nInvestments (3) 1,281 — 1,281 —\nTotal $ 22,394 $ 12,225 $ 10,169 $ —\n(1) The fair values of our deferred compensation plan investments are based on the closing market prices of the elected investments and are included in other noncurrent assets in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets.\n(2) The fair values of our interest rate swaps are based upon Level 2 inputs, which include valuation models. The key inputs for the valuation models are quoted market prices, interest rates, forward\nyield curves and credit risk adjustments that are necessary to reflect the probability of default by the counterparty or us. For disclosures about the fair value measurements of our derivative\ninstruments, see Note 7.\n(3) The fair values of our investments are valued using a readily determinable net asset value per share based on the fair value of the underlying securities. There are no significant redemption\nrestrictions associated with these investments.\nThose assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:\nSignificant Unobservable\nInputs\n(Level 3) Impairment Charges\n(In thousands)\nFair value measurements as of September 25, 2024:\nAssets held and used (1) $ — $ 78\n(1) As of September 25, 2024, impaired assets were written down to their fair value. To determine fair value, we used the income approach, which assumes that the future cash flows reflect\ncurrent market expectations. These fair value measurements require significant judgment using Level 3 inputs, such as discounted cash flows from operations, which are not observable from\nthe market, directly or indirectly. There is uncertainty in the projected future cash flows used in the Company's impairment analysis, which requires the use of estimates and assumptions. If\nactual performance does not achieve the projections, or if the assumptions used change in the future, the Company may be required to recognize impairment charges in future periods.\nAssets that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include property, operating lease right-of-use assets, finance lease right-of-use assets, goodwill\nand intangible assets. During the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we recognized impairment charges of $0.1 million and $0.8\nmillion, respectively, related to certain of these assets. See Note 4 and Note 9.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are deemed to approximate fair value due to\nthe immediate or short-term maturity of these instruments. The fair value of notes receivable approximates the carrying value after consideration of recorded\nallowances and related risk-based interest rates. The liabilities under our credit facility are carried at historical cost, which approximates fair value. The fair\nvalue of our senior secured revolver approximates its carrying value since it is a variable rate facility (Level 2).\n12\nNote 7. Long-Term Debt\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a credit facility consisting of a five-year $400 million senior secured revolver (with a $25 million letter of\ncredit sublimit). The credit facility includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the size of the facility to $450 million. Borrowings bear a\ntiered interest rate, which is based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio. The maturity date for the credit facility is August 26, 2026.\nThe credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by the Company\nand its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the stock of its subsidiaries (other than its insurance captive\nsubsidiary). It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The credit facility also includes certain financial covenants\nwith respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial\ncovenants as of September 25, 2024.\nAs of September 25, 2024, we had outstanding revolver loans of $261.0 million and outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility of $16.1 million.\nThese balances resulted in unused commitments of $122.9 million as of September 25, 2024 under the credit facility.\nAs of September 25, 2024, borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at a rate of Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.25%. Letters of credit under the\ncredit facility bore interest at a rate of 2.38%. The commitment fee, paid on the unused portion of the credit facility, was set to 0.35%.\nPrior to considering the impact of our interest rate swaps, described below, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding revolver loans was 7.68% and\n7.41% as of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, respectively. Taking into consideration our interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow\nhedges, the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding revolver loans was 5.14% and 5.04% as of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, respectively.\nInterest Rate Hedges\nWe have receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the forecasted cash flows of our floating rate debt. A summary of our interest rate swaps as of\nSeptember 25, 2024 is as follows:\nTrade Date Effective Date Maturity Date Notional Amount Fair Value Fixed Rate\n(In thousands)\nSwaps designated as cash\nflow hedges\nMarch 20, 2015 March 29, 2018 March 31, 2025 $ 120,000 $ 1,159 2.34 %\nOctober 1, 2015 March 29, 2018 March 31, 2026 $ 50,000 $ 811 2.37 %\nFebruary 15, 2018 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2033 $ 60,000 (1) $ 3,942 3.09 %\nTotal $ 230,000 $ 5,912\n(1) The notional amounts of the swaps entered into on February 15, 2018 increase periodically until they reach the maximum notional amount of $335 million on August 31, 2033.\nTermination and Designation of Certain Interest Rate Swaps\nDuring the quarter ended March 29, 2023, we terminated a portion of our hedging relationship entered into in 2018 (“2018 Swaps”), reducing the previous\nmaximum notional amount of $425 million on August 31, 2033 to $335 million. We received $1.5 million of cash as a result of the termination, which is\nrecorded as a component of operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023.\nIn addition, during the quarter ended March 29, 2023, we designated the remaining 2018 Swaps as cash flow hedges of our exposure to variability in future\ncash flows attributable to variable rate interest payments due on forecasted notional amounts.\n13\nChanges in Fair Value of Interest Rate Swaps\nTo the extent the swaps are highly effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the fair value of the swaps are not included in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income but are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow\nhedges with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net.\nAs of September 25, 2024, the fair value of the swaps designated as cash flow hedges was an asset of $5.9 million, recorded as a component of other\nnoncurrent assets. The designated swaps have an offsetting amount (before taxes) recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net in our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 13 for amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to interest rate swaps. During the year-to-\ndate period ended September 25, 2024, we reclassified $4.6 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net as a reduction to interest expense, net. We\nexpect to reclassify $6.6 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net as a reduction to interest expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of\nIncome related to swaps designated as cash flow hedges during the next 12 months.\nFor the periods prior to their designation as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the 2018 Swaps were recorded as a component of other nonoperating\n(income) expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023, we recorded expense of $10.6 million\nas a component of other nonoperating (income) expense, net related to the 2018 Swaps resulting from changes in fair value.\nAmortization of Certain Amounts Included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net\nAt September 25, 2024, we had a total of $63.7 million (before taxes) included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net related to (i) the discontinuance\nof hedge accounting treatment related to certain cash flow hedges in prior years and (ii) the fair value of certain swaps at the date of designation as cash flow\nhedges that are being amortized into our Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of interest expense, net over the remaining term of the related\nswap.\nFor the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we recorded unrealized losses of $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, to interest\nexpense, net. For the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023, we recorded unrealized losses of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, to\ninterest expense, net. We expect to amortize $2.3 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net to interest expense, net in our Consolidated\nStatements of Income related to dedesignated interest rate swaps during the next 12 months.\nNote 8. Revenues\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by sales channel and type of good or service:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nCompany restaurant sales $ 52,701 $ 53,153 $ 159,391 $ 161,486\nFranchise and license revenue:\nRoyalties 29,101 29,703 88,421 90,106\nAdvertising revenue 20,172 19,297 59,098 58,818\nInitial and other fees 1,639 3,388 5,903 10,994\nOccupancy revenue 8,146 8,642 24,847 27,165\nFranchise and license revenue 59,058 61,030 178,269 187,083\nTotal operating revenue $ 111,759 $ 114,183 $ 337,660 $ 348,569\n14\nFranchise occupancy revenue consisted of the following:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease revenue $ 6,063 $ 6,461 $ 18,262 $ 20,015\nVariable lease revenue 2,083 2,181 6,585 7,150\nTotal occupancy revenue $ 8,146 $ 8,642 $ 24,847 $ 27,165\nBalances related to contracts with customers consist of receivables, contract assets, deferred franchise revenue and deferred gift card revenue.

These amounts\nwill be recognized as a component of franchise and license revenue over the remaining term of the related franchise agreements.\nThe components of the change in contract assets are as follows:\n(In thousands)\nBalance, December 27, 2023 $ 6,608\nFranchisee deferred costs 293\nContract asset amortization (980)\nBalance, September 25, 2024 5,921\nLess current portion included in other current assets 941\nContract assets included in other noncurrent assets $ 4,980\nThe Company purchases equipment related to various programs for franchise restaurants, including kitchen and point-of-sale system equipment. We bill our\nfranchisees and recognize revenue when the related equipment is installed, less amounts contributed from the Company, which have been deferred as contract\nassets in the table above. We recognized $0.1 million and $0.6 million of revenue, recorded as a component of initial and other fees, related to the sale of\nequipment to franchisees during the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, respectively. We recognized $1.7 million and $4.6 million of\nrevenue, recorded as a component of initial and other fees, related to the sale of equipment to franchisees during the quarter and year-to-date period ended\nSeptember 27, 2023, respectively. As of September 25, 2024, we had $0.3 million in inventory and $0.2 million in receivables related to the purchased\nequipment.

As the TSR based PSUs contain a market condition, a Monte Carlo valuation was used to determine the grant date fair value. The performance\nperiod for these PSUs is the three-year fiscal period beginning December 28, 2023 and ending December 30, 2026. The PSUs will vest and be earned at the end\nof the performance period at which point the relative TSR achievement percentages will be applied to the vested units (from 0% to 200% of the target award).\nDuring the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we also granted certain employees 0.7 million restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") with a weighted\naverage grant date fair value of $10.63 per share. These RSUs generally vest evenly over the three-year fiscal period beginning December 28, 2023 and ending\nDecember 30, 2026. We recognize compensation cost associated with these RSU awards on a straight-line basis over the entire performance period of the\naward.\nDuring the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we issued 0.4 million shares of common stock related to vested PSUs and RSUs. In addition, 0.2\nmillion shares of common stock were withheld in lieu of taxes related to vested PSUs and RSUs.\nAs of September 25, 2024, we had $16.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested PSU awards and RSU awards outstanding, which have\na weighted average remaining contractual term of 1.9 years.\nRestricted Stock Units for Board Members\nDuring the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we granted 0.1 million RSUs (which are equity classified) with a weighted average grant date fair\nvalue of $8.09 per unit to non-employee members of our Board of Directors. The RSUs vest after a one-year service period. A director may elect to convert\nthese awards to shares of common stock either on a specific date in the future (while still serving as a member of our Board of Directors), upon termination as a\nmember of our Board of Directors, or in three equal annual installments commencing after termination of service as a member of our Board of Directors.\nDuring the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, fewer than 0.1 million RSUs were converted into shares of common stock.\n17\nAs of September 25, 2024, we had $0.6 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSU awards outstanding, which have a weighted\naverage remaining contractual term of 0.6 years.\nNote 11.

Shareholders' Deficit\nShare Repurchases\nOur credit facility permits the repurchase of the Company's stock and the payment of cash dividends subject to certain limitations. Our Board of Directors\napproves share repurchases of our common stock. Under these authorizations, we may, from time to time, purchase shares in the open market (including pre-\narranged stock trading plans in accordance with the guidelines specified in Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or in privately\nnegotiated transactions, subject to market and business conditions. Currently, we are operating under a $250 million share repurchase authorization approved\nby the Board of Directors in December 2019.\nDuring the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we repurchased a total of 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $11.2 million, including excise\ntaxes. This brings the total amount repurchased under the current authorization to $160.8 million, leaving $89.2 million that can be used to repurchase our\ncommon stock under this authorization as of September 25, 2024. Repurchased shares are included as treasury stock in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and\nour Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Deficit.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Board approved the retirement of 12.8 million shares of treasury stock at a weighted average share price of $11.02,\nincluding excise taxes. As of September 25, 2024, 2.0 million shares were held in treasury stock.\n18\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, Net\nThe components of the change in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net were as follows:\nAccumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss,\nDefined Benefit Plans Derivatives Net\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of December 27, 2023 $ (337) $ (41,322) $ (41,659)\nAmortization of net loss (1) 60 — 60\nSettlement loss recognized 26 — 26\nChanges in the fair value of cash flow hedges — 1,650 1,650\nReclassification of cash flow hedges to interest expense, net (2) — (4,626) (4,626)\nAmortization of unrealized losses related to interest rate swaps to interest expense, net — 502 502\nIncome tax expense related to items of other comprehensive income (loss) (23) 625 602\nBalance as of September 25, 2024 $ (274) $ (43,171) $ (43,445)\n(1) Before-tax amount related to our defined benefit plans that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net and included as a component of pension expense within general and\nadministrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income during the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024.\n(2) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss, net into interest expense, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income represent payments either (received from) or made to\nthe counterparty for the interest rate hedges.

Segment Information\nWe manage our business by brand and as a result have identified two operating segments, Denny’s and Keke’s. In addition, we have identified Denny’s as a\nreportable segment. The Denny’s reportable segment includes the results of all company and franchised and licensed Denny’s restaurants. Our Keke’s operating\nsegment, which includes the results of all company and franchised Keke's restaurants, is included in Other.\nThe primary sources of revenues for all operating segments are the sale of food and beverages at our company restaurants and the collection of royalties,\nadvertising revenue, initial and other fees, including occupancy revenue, from restaurants operated by our franchisees. We do not rely on any major customer as\na source of sales and the customers and assets of all operating segments are located predominantly in the United States. There are no material transactions\nbetween segments.\nManagement’s measure of segment income is restaurant-level operating margin. The Company defines restaurant-level operating margin as operating income\nexcluding the following four items: general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment charges and operating (gains),\nlosses and other charges, net. The Company excludes general and administrative expenses, which include primarily non restaurant-level costs associated with\nthe support of company and franchised restaurants and other activities at their corporate office. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expense,\nsubstantially all of which is related to company restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent historical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash\noutlays for the restaurants. The Company excludes operating (gains), losses and other charges, net, to provide a clearer perspective of its ongoing operating\nperformance. Restaurant-level operating margin is used by our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and\nperformance.\nThe following tables present revenues by segment and a reconciliation of restaurant-level operating margin to net income:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\nRevenues by operating segment: (In thousands)\nDenny’s $ 105,365 $ 109,136 $ 318,728 $ 332,952\nOther 6,394 5,047 18,932 15,617\nTotal operating revenue $ 111,759 $ 114,183 $ 337,660 $ 348,569\nSegment income:\nDenny’s $ 35,015 $ 36,944 $ 102,750 $ 111,525\nOther 925 1,536 2,593 5,434\nTotal restaurant-level operating margin $ 35,940 $ 38,480 $ 105,343 $ 116,959\nGeneral and administrative expenses $ 19,831 $ 18,237 $ 61,539 $ 58,515\nDepreciation and amortization 3,622 3,605 10,938 10,878\nGoodwill impairment charges — — 20 —\nOperating (gains), losses and other charges, net 746 2,620 1,984 2,467\nTotal other operating expenses 24,199 24,462 74,481 71,860\nOperating income 11,741 14,018 30,862 45,099\nInterest expense, net 4,571 4,381 13,564 13,288\nOther nonoperating (income) expense, net (824) 43 (1,685) 9,470\nIncome before income taxes 7,994 9,594 18,983 22,341\nProvision for income taxes 1,478 1,686 4,208 5,298\nNet income $ 6,516 $ 7,908 $ 14,775 $ 17,043\nSeptember 25, 2024 December 27, 2023\nSegment assets: (In thousands)\nDenny’s $ 320,642 $ 340,136\nOther 140,981 124,682\nTotal assets $ 461,623 $ 464,818\n20\nItem 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") should be read in conjunction with our\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this report and the MD&A contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 27, 2023.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as codified in Section 27A of the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").

In addition, certain matters discussed in this report\nmay constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known,\nare intended to speak only as of the date such statements are made and involve risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual performance of\nDenny’s Corporation, its subsidiaries, and underlying restaurants to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements.\nWords such as “expect”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, “hope”, \"will\" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify\nsuch forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking\nstatements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Factors that could cause actual\nperformance to differ materially from the performance indicated by these forward-looking statements include, among others: economic, public health and\npolitical conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending; commodity and labor inflation; the ability to effectively staff restaurants and support\npersonnel; our ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity for our cash needs, including debt obligations, payment of dividends, planned share repurchases\nand capital expenditures as well as the ability of our customers, suppliers, franchisees and lenders to access sources of liquidity to provide for their own cash\nneeds; competitive pressures from within the restaurant industry; our ability to integrate and derive the expected benefits from our acquisition of Keke's; the\nlevel of success of our operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts; adverse publicity; health concerns arising from food-related pandemics,\noutbreaks of flu viruses, or other diseases; changes in business strategy or development plans; terms and availability of capital; regional weather conditions;\noverall changes in the general economy (including with regard to energy costs), particularly at the retail level; political environment and geopolitical events\n(including acts of war and terrorism); and other factors from time to time set forth in the Company’s SEC reports and other filings, including but not limited to\nthe discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the risks identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2023 and in the Company's subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nOverview\nWe manage our business by brand and as a result have identified two operating segments, Denny’s and Keke’s. As of September 25, 2024, the Denny's brand\nconsisted of 1,525 restaurants, 1,464 of which were franchised/licensed restaurants and 61 of which were company operated. At September 25, 2024, the\nKeke's brand consisted of 61 restaurants, 50 of which were franchised restaurants and 11 of which were company operated.\nIn addition, we have identified Denny’s as a reportable segment. The Denny’s reportable segment includes the results of all company and franchised and\nlicensed Denny’s restaurants. Total revenues at Keke’s for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 represented less than 10% of total\nconsolidated revenues, therefore, the Keke’s operating segment is included in Other for segment reporting purposes.\n21\nStatements of Income\nThe following table contains information derived from our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of total operating revenue, except as\nnoted below.

The decreases in company restaurant sales were partially offset by three additional Keke's equivalent units for the current quarter and two additional\nKeke's equivalent units year-to-date compared to the prior year periods.\nTotal costs of company restaurant sales as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 88.8% for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 89.4% year-to-\ndate compared to 86.3% and 86.0% for the prior year periods, respectively.\nProduct costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 25.8% for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 25.4% year-to-date compared to 25.6%\nand 25.9% for the prior year periods, respectively. The current quarter increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to higher\ncommodity costs, partially offset by increased pricing. The year-to-date decrease was primarily due to increased pricing, partially offset by higher commodity\ncosts.\nPayroll and benefits as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 37.6% for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 38.1% year-to-date compared to\n37.2% and 37.5%, respectively, for the prior year periods. The current quarter increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.3\npercentage point increase in incentive compensation. The year-to-date increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.4\npercentage point increase in workers' compensation costs, primarily resulting from negative claims development in the current year.\nOccupancy costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales were 8.4% for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and 8.6% year-to-date compared to 7.7%\nand 7.6%, respectively, for the prior year periods. The current quarter increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.4\npercentage point increase in general liability insurance costs resulting from negative claims development in the current quarter and a 0.4 percentage point\nincrease in rent and property taxes. The year-to-date increase as a percentage of company restaurant sales was primarily due to a 0.7 percentage point increase\nin general liability insurance costs resulting from negative claims development in the current year and a 0.3 percentage point increase in rent and property\ntaxes.\n24\nOther operating expenses consist of the following amounts and percentages of company restaurant sales:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nUtilities $ 1,959 3.7 % $ 2,120 4.0 % $ 5,309 3.3 % $ 6,037 3.7 %\nRepairs and maintenance 964 1.8 % 996 1.9 % 2,977 1.9 % 2,667 1.7 %\nMarketing 1,859 3.5 % 1,393 2.6 % 5,339 3.3 % 4,207 2.6 %\nLegal settlements 152 0.3 % 245 0.5 % 1,809 1.1 % 475 0.3 %\nPre-opening costs 209 0.4 % 105 0.2 % 766 0.5 % 130 0.1 %\nOther direct costs 3,785 7.2 % 3,608 6.8 % 11,270 7.1 % 10,900 6.7 %\nOther operating expenses $ 8,928 16.9 % $ 8,467 15.9 % $ 27,470 17.2 % $ 24,416 15.1 %\nThe current quarter increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to increased marketing. The year-to-date increase was primarily due to increased\nmarketing and unfavorable developments in certain legal claims during the current year period, partially offset by lower utility costs.\nFranchise Operations\nFranchise and license revenue and costs of franchise and license revenue consisted of the following amounts and percentages of franchise and license revenue\nfor the periods indicated:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nRoyalties $ 29,101 49.3 % $ 29,703 48.7 % $ 88,421 49.6 % $ 90,106 48.2 %\nAdvertising revenue 20,172 34.2 % 19,297 31.6 % 59,098 33.2 % 58,818 31.4 %\nInitial and other fees 1,639 2.8 % 3,388 5.6 % 5,903 3.3 % 10,994 5.9 %\nOccupancy revenue 8,146 13.8 % 8,642 14.2 % 24,847 13.9 % 27,165 14.5 %\nFranchise and license revenue $ 59,058 100.0 % $ 61,030 100.0 % $ 178,269 100.0 % $ 187,083 100.0 %\nAdvertising costs $ 20,172 34.2 % $ 19,297 31.6 % $ 59,098 33.2 % $ 58,818 31.4 %\nOccupancy costs 5,256 8.9 % 5,389 8.8 % 15,482 8.7 % 16,853 9.0 %\nOther direct franchise costs 3,571 6.0 % 5,124 8.4 % 15,221 8.5 % 16,986 9.1 %\nCosts of franchise and license revenue $ 28,999 49.1 % $ 29,810 48.8 % $ 89,801 50.4 % $ 92,657 49.5 %\nFranchise and license revenue decreased $2.0 million, or 3.2%, for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and $8.8 million, or 4.7%, year-to-date compared to\nthe prior year periods. Royalties decreased $0.6 million, or 2.0%, and $1.7 million, or 1.9%, for the current quarter and year-to-date period, respectively,\ncompared to the prior year periods. The decreases in royalties primarily resulted from a decrease of 53 Denny's franchise equivalent units for the current\nquarter and 40 franchise equivalent units year-to-date, compared to the prior year periods, and a decrease in Denny's domestic franchise same-store sales of\n0.1% for the current quarter and 0.6% year-to-date as compared to the prior year periods. The decreases were partially offset by an increase in Keke's franchise\nequivalent units of two units and three units for the current quarter and year-to-date period, respectively.\nAdvertising revenue increased $0.9 million, or 4.5%, for the current quarter and $0.3 million, or 0.5%, year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. The\nincrease in advertising revenue for the current quarter primarily resulted from a $1.0 million increase in local advertising co-op contributions, partially offset by\nthe impact from a 0.1% decrease in Denny's domestic franchise same-store sales and a decrease of 53 Denny's franchise equivalent units. The increase in\nadvertising revenue for the year-to-date period primarily resulted from a $0.7 million increase in local advertising co-op contributions, partially offset by the\nimpact of a 0.6% decrease in Denny's domestic franchise same-store sales and a decrease of 40 Denny's franchise equivalent units compared to the prior year\nperiod.\n25\nInitial and other fees decreased $1.7 million, or 51.6%, for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and $5.1 million, or 46.3%, year-to-date compared to the\nprior year periods. The decreases in initial and other fees primarily resulted from a $1.6 million and $4.0 million decrease in revenue from the sale of\nequipment to franchisees during the current quarter and year-to-date period, respectively, as a result of the completion of our kitchen modernization program in\n2023. The revenue recorded related to the sale of equipment has an equal and offsetting expense recorded in other direct costs as described below. Occupancy\nrevenue decreased $0.5 million, or 5.7%, for the current quarter and $2.3 million, or 8.5%, year-to-date compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to\nlease terminations.\nCosts of franchise and license revenue decreased $0.8 million, or 2.7%, for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and decreased $2.9 million, or 3.1%, year-to-\ndate compared to the prior year periods. Advertising costs increased $0.9 million, or 4.5%, for the current quarter and increased $0.3 million, or 0.5%, year-to-\ndate, which corresponds to the related advertising revenue increases for the current quarter and year-to-date noted above. Occupancy costs decreased $0.1\nmillion, or 2.5%, for the current quarter and $1.4 million, or 8.1%, year-to-date compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to lease terminations, which\ncorresponds to the related occupancy revenue decreases noted above. Other direct franchise costs decreased $1.6 million, or 30.3%, for the current quarter and\n$1.8 million, or 10.4%, year-to-date compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in other direct franchise costs for the current quarter was primarily due to\na $1.7 million decrease in costs from the sale of equipment to franchisees as noted above. The year-to-date decrease in other direct franchise costs was\nprimarily due to a $3.9 million decrease in costs from the sale of equipment to franchisees as noted above, partially offset by a $2.6 million distribution to\nfranchisees related to a review of advertising costs. As a result of the changes in franchise and license revenue discussed above, costs of franchise and license\nrevenue increased to 49.1% and 50.4% of franchise and license revenue for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, respectively, from\n48.8% and 49.5% for the prior year periods, respectively.\nOther Operating Costs and Expenses\nOther operating costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expense relate to both company and\nfranchise operations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consisted of the following:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nCorporate administrative expenses $ 15,875 $ 14,580 $ 46,843 $ 43,919\nShare-based compensation 3,006 2,864 8,406 8,477\nIncentive compensation 447 1,049 4,868 5,335\nDeferred compensation valuation adjustments 503 (256) 1,422 784\nTotal general and administrative expenses $ 19,831 $ 18,237 $ 61,539 $ 58,515\nCorporate administrative expenses increased $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and $2.9 million year-to-date compared to the prior year\nperiods. The increases were primarily due to increases in employee compensation and software subscription costs. Changes in deferred compensation valuation\nadjustments have offsetting gains or losses on the underlying nonqualified deferred plan investments included as a component of other non-operating expense\n(income), net, for the corresponding periods.\n26\nDepreciation and amortization consisted of the following:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nDepreciation of property and equipment $ 2,752 $ 2,722 $ 8,230 $ 8,118\nAmortization of finance lease ROU assets 319 348 1,019 1,099\nAmortization of intangible and other assets 551 535 1,689 1,661\nTotal depreciation and amortization expense $ 3,622 $ 3,605 $ 10,938 $ 10,878\nGoodwill impairment charges were less than $0.1 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 related to assets eventually sold by Denny's.\nOperating (gains), losses and other charges, net consisted of the following:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nLosses (gains) on sales of assets and other, net $ 6 $ (88) $ (88) $ (2,132)\nImpairment charges (1) 78 1,711 792 1,840\nRestructuring charges and exit costs 662 997 1,280 2,759\nOperating (gains), losses and other charges, net $ 746 $ 2,620 $ 1,984 $ 2,467\n(1) Impairment charges include impairments related to property, operating right-of-use assets, finance right-of-use assets, franchise agreements, and reacquired franchise rights.\nLosses (gains) on sales of assets and other, net for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 were primarily related to the sale of\nrestaurants and real estate. Gains on sales of assets and other, net for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023 were primarily related to\nthe sale of real estate.\nWe recorded impairment charges of $0.1 million and $0.8 million during the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, respectively, primarily\nrelated to assets held for sale and resulting from our assessments of underperforming units and closed units.\nRestructuring charges and exit costs consisted of the following:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nExit costs $ 231 $ 12 $ 322 $ 64\nSeverance and other restructuring charges 431 985 958 2,695\nTotal restructuring and exit costs $ 662 $ 997 $ 1,280 $ 2,759\nOperating income was $11.7 million for the current quarter and $30.9 million year-to-date compared to $14.0 million and $45.1 million, respectively, for the\nprior year periods.\n27\nInterest expense, net consisted of the following:\nQuarter Ended Three Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nInterest on credit facility $ 5,158 $ 4,823 $ 15,382 $ 14,053\nInterest income on interest rate swaps (1,582) (1,386) (4,626) (3,551)\nInterest on finance lease liabilities 495 529 1,501 1,618\nLetters of credit and other fees 199 202 510 598\nInterest income (51) (40) (183) (139)\nTotal cash interest, net 4,219 4,128 12,584 12,579\nAmortization of deferred financing costs 159 159 477 476\nAmortization of interest rate swap losses 193 93 502 231\nInterest accretion on other liabilities — 1 1 2\nTotal interest expense, net $ 4,571 $ 4,381 $ 13,564 $ 13,288\nOther nonoperating income, net increased $0.9 million for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and increased $11.2 million year-to-date compared to the\nprior year periods. The increase for the current quarter was due to increased gains on deferred compensation plan investments. The increase for the year-to-date\nperiod was primarily due to losses related to dedesignated interest rate swap valuation adjustments in the prior year period.\nDuring the quarter ended March 29, 2023, we terminated a portion of our hedging relationship entered into in 2018 (“2018 Swaps”), reducing the previous\nmaximum notional amount of $425 million on August 31, 2033 to $335 million. In addition, during the quarter ended March 29, 2023, we designated the\nremaining 2018 Swaps as cash flow hedges of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to variable rate interest payments due on forecasted\nnotional amounts. As a result, subsequent to the designation of the 2018 Swaps, gains and losses related to these cash flow hedges have been and will be\nrecorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net.\nProvision for income taxes was $1.5 million for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and $4.2 million year-to-date compared to $1.7 million and $5.3\nmillion, respectively, for the prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 18.5% for the current quarter and 22.2% year-to-date, compared to 17.6% and 23.7%\nfor the prior year periods, respectively. We expect the 2024 fiscal year effective tax rate to be between 22% and 26%. The annual effective tax rate cannot be\ndetermined until the end of the fiscal year; therefore, the actual rate could differ from our current estimates.\nNet income was $6.5 million for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 and $14.8 million year-to-date compared to $7.9 million and $17.0 million,\nrespectively, for the prior year periods.\n28\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility (as described below).\nPrincipal uses of cash are operating expenses, capital expenditures, and the repurchase of shares of our common stock.\nThe following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated:\nThree Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 20,947 $ 50,768\nNet cash used in investing activities (17,616) (3,024)\nNet cash used in financing activities (6,758) (50,245)\nDecrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,427) $ (2,501)\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $20.9 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 compared to $50.8 million for the\nyear-to-date period ended September 27, 2023. The decrease in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to decreases in operating\nincome, accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, and inventory usage and receivable collections due to the completion of our kitchen modernization program\nin 2023. We believe that our estimated cash flows from operations, combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our credit facility and cash on\nhand, will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures over the next 12 months.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $17.6 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024. These cash flows included capital\nexpenditures of $17.7 million and investment purchases of $1.5 million, partially offset by net proceeds from asset sales of $1.4 million. Net cash flows used in\ninvesting activities were $3.0 million for the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023. These cash flows included capital expenditures of $5.5 million,\ninvestment purchases of $1.3 million, and a real estate acquisition of $1.2 million, partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of three parcels of real estate\nfor $3.1 million and net investment proceeds of $1.9 million.\nOur principal capital requirements have been largely associated with the following:\nThree Quarters Ended\nSeptember 25, 2024 September 27, 2023\n(In thousands)\nFacilities $ 5,543 $ 3,199\nNew construction 7,807 730\nRemodeling 1,891 404\nInformation technology 1,376 732\nOther 1,093 434\nCapital expenditures $ 17,710 $ 5,499\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $6.8 million for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, including cash payments for stock\nrepurchases of $11.3 million and payments of tax withholding on share-based compensation of $1.9 million, partially offset by net long-term debt borrowings\nof $4.4 million and net bank overdrafts of $1.9 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $50.2 million for the year-to-date period ended\nSeptember 27, 2023, which included cash payments for stock repurchases of $35.4 million, payments of tax withholding on share-based compensation of $3.0\nmillion and net long-term debt payments of $14.8 million, partially offset by net bank overdrafts of $2.9 million.\n29\nOur working capital deficit was $53.8 million at September 25, 2024 compared to $59.3 million at December 27, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in accounts\npayable and other accrued liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in current assets during the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024. We are able to\noperate with a substantial working capital deficit because (1) restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash (and\ncash equivalent) basis with a low level of accounts receivable, (2) rapid turnover allows for a limited investment in inventories, and (3) accounts payable for\nfood, beverages and supplies usually becomes due after the receipt of cash from the related sales.\nCredit Facility\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries have a credit facility consisting of a five-year $400 million senior secured revolver (with a $25 million letter of\ncredit sublimit). The credit facility includes an accordion feature that would allow us to increase the size of the facility to $450 million. Borrowings bear a\ntiered interest rate, which is based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio. The maturity date for the credit facility is August 26, 2026.\nThe credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. The credit facility is guaranteed by the Company\nand its material subsidiaries and is secured by assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the stock of its subsidiaries (other than its insurance captive\nsubsidiary). It includes negative covenants that are usual for facilities and transactions of this type. The credit facility also includes certain financial covenants\nwith respect to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with all financial\ncovenants as of September 25, 2024.\nAs of September 25, 2024, we had outstanding revolver loans of $261.0 million and outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility of $16.1 million.\nThese balances resulted in unused commitments of $122.9 million as of September 25, 2024 under the credit facility.\nAs of September 25, 2024, borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at a rate of Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.25%. Letters of credit under the\ncredit facility bore interest at a rate of 2.38%. The commitment fee, paid on the unused portion of the credit facility, was set to 0.35%.\nPrior to considering the impact of our interest rate swaps, described below, the weighted-average interest rate on outstanding revolver loans was 7.68% and\n7.41% as of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, respectively. Taking into consideration our interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow\nhedges, the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding revolver loans was 5.14% and 5.04% as of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, respectively.\nTechnology Transformation Initiatives\nThe Company has committed to investing approximately $4 million toward a new cloud-based restaurant technology platform in domestic franchise\nrestaurants, which will lay the foundation for future technology initiatives to further enhance the guest experience. The rollout is in progress and is expected to\ncontinue into 2025 and 2026.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFor information regarding our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, see the \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" section in Part II, Item 7,\n\"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 27, 2023.\nImplementation of New Accounting Standards\nInformation regarding the implementation of new accounting standards is incorporated by reference from Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial\nstatements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes. Specifically, as of September 25, 2024,\nborrowings under our credit facility bore interest at variable rates based on Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR plus 2.25% per annum.\n30\nWe have receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to hedge the forecasted cash flows of our floating rate debt. A summary of our interest rate swaps as of\nSeptember 25, 2024 is as follows:\nTrade Date Effective Date Maturity Date Notional Amount Fair Value Fixed Rate\n(In thousands)\nSwaps designated as cash\nflow hedges\nMarch 20, 2015 March 29, 2018 March 31, 2025 $ 120,000 $ 1,159 2.34 %\nOctober 1, 2015 March 29, 2018 March 31, 2026 $ 50,000 $ 811 2.37 %\nFebruary 15, 2018 March 31, 2020 December 31, 2033 $ 60,000 (1) $ 3,942 3.09 %\nTotal $ 230,000 $ 5,912\n(1) The notional amounts of the swaps entered into on February 15, 2018 increase periodically until they reach the maximum notional amount of $335 million on August 31, 2033.\nAs of September 25, 2024, our swaps effectively increased our ratio of fixed rate debt from 4% of total debt to 89% of total debt. Based on the levels of\nborrowings under the credit facility at September 25, 2024, if interest rates changed by 100 basis points, our annual cash flow and income before taxes would\nchange by $0.2 million. This computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the credit facility at September 25, 2024,\ntaking into consideration the interest rate swaps that will be in effect during the next 12 months. However, the nature and amount of our borrowings may vary\nas a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors.\nDepending on market considerations, fluctuations in the fair values of our interest rate swaps could be significant. With the exception of these changes in the\nfair value of our interest rate swaps and in the levels of borrowings under our credit facility, there have been no material changes in our quantitative and\nqualitative market risks since the prior reporting period. For additional information related to our interest rate swaps, including changes in the fair value, refer\nto Note 6, Note 7 and Note 13 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nItem 4. Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management conducted an evaluation (under the supervision and with the participation of our\nChief Executive Officer, Kelli F. Valade, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Robert P. Verostek) as of the end of the period covered\nby this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act.\nBased on that evaluation, Ms. Valade and Mr. Verostek each concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and\nreported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our\nmanagement, including Ms. Valade and Mr. Verostek, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange\nAct that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 25, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nInformation regarding legal proceedings is incorporated by reference from Note 14 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements set forth in Part I, Item 1\nof this report.\nItem 1A.

          "content": "KELLI VALADE\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company urges caution in considering its current trends and any outlook on earnings disclosed either in this presentation or in its press releases. In addition, certain matters discussed in either this presentation or related press releases\nmay constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements, which reflect management's best judgment based on factors currently known, are intended to speak only as of the date such statements are made and involve risks,\nuncertainties, and other factors that may cause the actual performance of Denny’s Corporation, its subsidiaries, and underlying restaurants to be materially different from the performance indicated or implied by such statements. Words such as\n“expect”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “intend”, “plan”, “hope”, \"will\", and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Except as may be required by law, the Company expressly disclaims\nany obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date this presentation was published or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Factors that could cause actual performance to differ\nmaterially from the performance indicated by these forward-looking statements include, among others: economic, public health and political conditions that impact consumer confidence and spending; commodity and labor inflation; the ability to\neffectively staff restaurants and support personnel; the Company's ability to maintain adequate levels of liquidity for its cash needs, including debt obligations, payment of dividends, planned share repurchases and capital expenditures as well as\nthe ability of its customers, suppliers, franchisees and lenders to access sources of liquidity to provide for their own cash needs; competitive pressures from within the restaurant industry; the Company's ability to integrate and derive the\nexpected benefits from its acquisition of Keke's Breakfast Cafe; the level of success of the Company’s operating initiatives and advertising and promotional efforts; adverse publicity; health concerns arising from food-related pandemics,\noutbreaks of flu viruses or other diseases; changes in business strategy or development plans; terms and availability of capital; regional weather conditions; overall changes in the general economy (including with regard to energy costs),\nparticularly at the retail level; political environment and geopolitical events (including acts of war and terrorism); and other factors from time to time set forth in the Company’s SEC reports and other filings, including but not limited to the\ndiscussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis and the risks identified in Item 1A. Risk Factors contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2023 (and in the Company’s subsequent\nQuarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K).\nThe presentation includes references to the Company’s non-GAAP financials measures. All such measures are designated by an asterisk (*). The Company believes that, in addition to GAAP measures, certain non-GAAP financial measures are\nuseful information to investors and analysts to assist in the evaluation of operating performance on a period-to-period basis. However, non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, operating income, net\nincome, and net income per share, or other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share internally as performance measures\nfor planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets, and for compensation purposes, including incentive compensation for certain employees. These non-GAAP measures are adjusted for certain items the Company\ndoes not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance. These adjustments are either non-recurring in nature or vary from period to period without correlation to the Company's ongoing core operating performance. See\nAppendix for non-GAAP reconciliations to the following GAAP measures:\n$ Millions YTD Sep\n2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023\n(except per share amounts) 2024\nOperating Income $73.6 $165.0 $6.7 $104.1 $60.6 $52.8 $30.9\nNet Income (Loss) $43.7 $117.4 ($5.1) $78.1 $74.7 $19.9 $14.8\nNet Income (Loss) per Share $0.67 $1.90 ($0.08) $1.19 $1.23 $0.35 $0.28\n3\nAGENDA\n1 Q3 2024 RESULTS\n2 STATE OF THE INDUSTRY\n3 DENNY’S\n4 KEKE’S\n5 FRANCHISEE Q&A\n6 LONG-RANGE OUTLOOK\nGOALS FOR TODAY\n1\nOpportunity to hear from members of talented executive leadership team\n2\nCommunicate ambition and path to revenue and cash flow growth\n3\nProvide long-range outlook\n5\nTHE EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM\nKelli Valade Chris Bode David Schmidt Robert\nChief Executive Officer President – Denny’s Inc.

However, non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, not a substitute for, operating income, net income, and net income per share, or other financial performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses\nrestaurant-level operating margin, company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin internally as performance measures for planning purposes, including the preparation of annual operating budgets, and for compensation purposes, including\nincentive compensation for certain employees. Restaurant-level operating margin is the total of company restaurant operating margin and franchise operating margin and excludes: (i) general and administrative expenses, which include primarily non-restaurant-level\ncosts associated with support of company and franchised restaurants and other activities at their corporate office; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which is related to company restaurant-level assets, because such expenses represent\nhistorical sunk costs which do not reflect current cash outlays for the restaurants; (iii) special items, included within operating (gains), losses and other charges, net, to provide investors with a clearer perspective of its ongoing operating performance and a more\nrelevant comparison to prior period results. Company restaurant operating margin is defined as company restaurant sales less costs of company restaurant sales (which include product costs, company restaurant level payroll and benefits, occupancy costs, and other\noperating costs including utilities, repairs and maintenance, marketing and other expenses) and presents it as a percent of company restaurant sales. Adjusted company operating restaurant margin is defined as company restaurant operating margin less certain items\nsuch as legal settlement expenses, pre-opening expenses, and other items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance. Franchise operating margin is defined as franchise and license revenue (which includes franchise\nroyalties and other non-food and beverage revenue streams such as initial franchise and other fees, advertising revenue and occupancy revenue) less costs of franchise and license revenue and presents it as a percent of franchise and license revenue. Adjusted\nfranchise operating margin is defined as franchise operating margin less certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance. Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin is the total of adjusted company restaurant\noperating margin and adjusted franchise operating margin and is defined as restaurant-level operating margin adjusted for certain items the Company does not consider in the evaluation of its ongoing core operating performance. These adjustments are either non-\nrecurring in nature or vary from period to period without correlation to the Company's ongoing core operating performance.
