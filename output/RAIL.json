Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\n11/12/2024\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\n_Company delivers 83% year-over-year revenue growth with strong gross margin_\n\n_Raises mid-point of full year Adjusted EBITDA guidance_\n\nCHICAGO, Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FreightCar America, Inc. (NASDAQ: RAIL) (“FreightCar America” or the “Company”), a diversified manufacturer and supplier of railroad freight cars, railcar parts and components, today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Revenues of $113.3 million on 961 railcar deliveries, compared to revenues of $61.9 million on 503 railcar deliveries in the third quarter of 2023, up 83% and 91% respectively\n  * Gross margin of 14.3% with gross profit of $16.2 million, compared to gross margin of 14.9% with gross profit of $9.2 million in the third quarter of 2023\n  * Net loss of ($107.0) million, or ($3.57) per share and Adjusted net income of $7.3 million, or $0.08 per share, driven by a ($110.0) million non-cash loss on warrant liability due to a significant appreciation in share price\n  * Adjusted EBITDA of $10.9 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2023, up 211%\n  * Ended the quarter with a backlog of 3,611 units valued at $372 million\n\n\n\n“We again demonstrate the power of our disciplined approach to growth and operational excellence. Delivering another solid quarter, that continues the momentum for a record-setting year out of our operating facility. Our team has consistently followed through on our commitments, with robust product shipments and adaptable operating capabilities. This reinforces our ability to meet our customers’ needs while improving our gross margins, and further demonstrates the power of our value proposition. We continue to showcase our ability to secure business through innovative solutions, and our ease of doing business which has led to a consistent higher quality of earnings,” commented Nick Randall, President and Chief Executive Officer of FreightCar America.\n\nRandall continued, “Our pipeline is invigorated, with consistent demand across a broad range of railcar types. As we head into the fourth quarter, we are well positioned to sustain this momentum through our differentiated offerings and unique market approach. Our commitment to innovation and operational flexibility sets us apart in the industry, ensuring that we deliver long-term value for our customers and shareholders.”\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Outlook**\n\nThe Company has updated its outlook for fiscal year 2024 as follows:\n\n**Fiscal 2024 Outlook** |  **Year-over-Year Growth at Midpoint**  \n---|---  \n**Revenue** |  $560 - $600 million |  62.0%  \n**Adjusted EBITDA 1** |  $37 - $39 million |  89.0%  \n**Railcar Deliveries** |  4,300 – 4,700 Railcars |  48.9%  \n  \n1. The Company does not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying the adjustments that are necessary to calculate such non-GAAP measure without unreasonable effort. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on future GAAP results.\n\nMike Riordan, Chief Financial Officer of FreightCar America, commented, “Given our strong order activity and delivery performance year to date, we are narrowing and raising the mid-point of our previously issued full-year EBITDA guidance to between $37 million and $39 million while reaffirming our previously stated revenue and delivery guidance. As we move forward, I am confident in our ability to achieve profitable growth and cash generation across the enterprise with an even stronger financial profile.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Conference Call & Webcast Information**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast on Tuesday, November 12 at 11:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results.

Forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. Our actual results may differ materially from the results described in or anticipated by our forward-looking statements due to certain risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties relate to, among other things, the cyclical nature of our business; adverse geopolitical, economic and market conditions, including inflation; material disruption in the movement of rail traffic for deliveries; fluctuating costs of raw materials including steel and aluminum; future changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations or interpretations thereof; delays in the delivery of raw materials; our ability to maintain relationships with our suppliers of railcar components; our reliance upon a small number of customers that represent a large percentage of our sales; the variable purchase patterns of our customers and the timing of completion, delivery and customer acceptance of orders; the highly competitive nature of our industry; the risk of lack of acceptance of our new railcar offerings, and other competitive factors. The factors listed above are not exhaustive. New factors emerge from time to time that may cause our business not to develop as we expect, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We expressly disclaim any duty to provide updates to any forward-looking statements made in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThis press release includes measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) and Adjusted EPS. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP and may also be inconsistent with similar measures presented by other companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the applicable most closely comparable GAAP measures, and reasons for the Company’s use of these measures, are presented in the attached pages. \n\nInvestor Contact: | RAILIR@Riveron.com  \n---|---  \n  \n**FreightCar America, Inc.****Consolidated Balance Sheets****(In thousands, except for share data)**  \n---  \n**September 30,****2024** |  **December 31,****2023**  \n**Assets**  \nCurrent assets  \nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents | $ |  44,830 | $ |  40,560  \nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $74 and $18 respectively | 24,319 | 6,408  \nVAT receivable | 2,489 | 2,926  \nInventories, net | 84,812 | 125,022  \nAssets held for sale | 629 | —  \nRelated party asset | 936 | 638  \nPrepaid expenses |  10,100 |  4,867  \nTotal current assets |  168,115 |  180,421  \nProperty, plant and equipment, net | 30,461 | 31,258  \nRailcars available for lease, net | — | 2,842  \nRight of use asset operating lease | 2,514 | 2,826  \nRight of use asset finance lease | 43,823 | 40,277  \nOther long-term assets |  1,036 |  1,835  \nTotal assets | $ |  245,949 | $ |  259,459  \n**Liabilities, Mezzanine Equity and Stockholders’ Deficit**  \nCurrent liabilities  \nAccounts and contractual payables | $ | 74,355 | $ | 84,417  \nRelated party accounts payable | 2,493 | 2,478  \nAccrued payroll and other employee costs | 7,447 | 5,738  \nAccrued warranty | 1,493 | 1,602  \nCustomer deposits | 8,865 | —  \nCurrent portion of long-term debt | — | 29,415  \nOther current liabilities |  10,196 |  13,711  \nTotal current liabilities |  104,849 |  137,361  \nWarrant liability | 162,382 | 36,801  \nAccrued pension costs | 1,226 | 1,046  \nLease liability operating lease, long-term | 2,778 | 3,164  \nLease liability finance lease, long-term | 45,482 | 41,273  \nOther long-term liabilities |  1,660 |  2,562  \nTotal liabilities |  318,377 |  222,207  \nCommitments and contingencies  \nMezzanine equity  \nSeries C Preferred stock, $0.01 par value, 85,412 shares authorized, 85,412 shares issued and outstanding at each of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

We believe EBITDA is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry. In addition, our management uses EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance. The calculation of EBITDA eliminates the effects of financing, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. These items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall performance of the company’s business. EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, when analyzing our operating performance, investors should not consider EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows from operating activities or other statements of operations or statements of cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our calculation of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to that of other similar titled measures reported by other companies.  \n---|---  \n(2) | Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA before the following charges:  \n(a) | This adjustment removes the non-cash expense (income) associated with the change in fair market value of the Company’s warrant liability.  \n(b) | During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on debt extinguishment of its term loan.  \n(c) | During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on pension settlement.  \n(d) | During the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a litigation settlement related to a dispute with a former lessee of our railcars.  \n(e) | During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a gain on sale of railcars available for lease related to its leased railcar fleet.  \nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash charges and other special items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters.

Our calculation of Adjusted net income (loss) is not necessarily comparable to that of other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  \n  \n**FreightCar America, Inc.****Reconciliation of EPS and Adjusted EPS****(****1)****(Unaudited)**  \n---  \n**Three Months Ended****September 30,** |  **Nine Months Ended****September 30,**  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \nEPS | $ |  (3.57 | ) | $ |  (0.03 | ) | $ |  (4.07 | ) | $ |  (0.94 | )  \nChange in Fair Value of Warrant (a) | $ | 3.51 | $ | (0.15 | ) | $ | 4.11 | $ | 0.07  \nLoss on Debt Extinguishment (b) | - | - | - | 0.53  \nLoss on Pension Settlement (c) | - | 0.01 | - | 0.01  \nLitigation Settlement (d) | - | - | (0.11 | ) | -  \nGain on Sale of Railcars Available for Lease (e) | - | - | - | (0.02 | )  \nStock Based Compensation | 0.03 | 0.02 | 0.08 | 0.02  \nOther, net |  0.02 |  0.01 |  0.05 |  0.01  \nTotal non-GAAP adjustments pre-tax per-share |  3.56 |  (0.11 | ) |  4.13 |  0.62  \nIncome tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments per share (f) |  0.09 |  0.02 |  0.03 |  0.02  \nAdjusted EPS | $ |  0.08 | $ |  (0.12 | ) | $ |  0.09 | $ |  (0.30 | )  \n  \n(1) | Adjusted EPS represents basic and diluted EPS before the following charges:  \n---|---  \na) | This adjustment removes the non-cash expense (income) associated with the change in fair market value of the Company’s warrant liability.  \nb) | During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on debt extinguishment of its term loan.  \nc) | During the third quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on pension settlement.  \nd) | During the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a litigation settlement related to a dispute with a former lessee of our railcars.  \ne) | During the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a gain on sale of railcars available for lease related to its leased railcar fleet.  \nf) | Income tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments per share represents the tax impact of the presented adjustments on the Company’s income tax provision calculation.  \nWe believe that Adjusted EPS is useful to investors evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because it eliminates the impact of certain non-cash charges and other special items that affect the comparability of results in past quarters.
