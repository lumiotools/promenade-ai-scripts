(NASDAQ: JACK)** announced financial results for the Jack in the Box and Del Taco segments in the fourth quarter, ended September 29, 2024. \n\n“I am very pleased we achieved our gross opening targets for both Jack in the Box and Del Taco in fiscal 2024, reflecting a level of growth not seen in over a decade, and also with the significant progress on our digital initiatives and POS rollout,” said Darin Harris, Jack in the Box Chief Executive Officer. “We managed well through a difficult top-line macro environment in 2024, and will continue to aggressively pursue initiatives to help energize sales and traffic in 2025.” \n\nJack in the Box Performance\n\nSame-store sales decreased 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024, comprised of a decrease in company-operated same-store sales of 2.2% and a decrease in franchise same-store sales of 2.0%. Sales performance was driven by a decrease in transactions and unfavorable menu mix, which was partially offset by price. Systemwide sales (1) for the fourth quarter decreased 1.7%. \n\nJack in the Box had 16 new restaurant openings and 20 restaurant closures during the fourth quarter. For fiscal year 2024, Jack in the Box opened 30 new restaurants, and was net positive 5 restaurants. As of the end of the fourth quarter, and since the launch of the development program in mid-2021, the company has signed 101 agreements for a total of 464 restaurants, with 51 already opened to date. During the fourth quarter, Jack in the Box announced an agreement with a new franchisee for 12 restaurants in the Chicago market, adding to the 8 company-owned openings planned for calendar year 2025. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin (3) , was 18.5% for the fourth quarter, a decrease from 20.7% in the prior year period. The decrease was driven by transaction declines, as well as inflationary increases in wages, commodities and utilities, slightly offset by menu price increases. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin (3) , was 40.4% for the fourth quarter, an increase from 39.9% a year ago. The increase was driven by lower information technology support costs and the benefit of franchise lease termination income in the current year, partially offset by lower franchise same-store sales, and lower early termination fees compared to the prior year. \n\n**Jack in the Box Same-Store Sales:**\n\n**12 Weeks Ended** |  **52 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nCompany  |  (2.2)%  |  4.4%  |  0.0%  |  8.8%   \nFranchise  |  (2.0)%  |  3.8%  |  (1.5)%  |  7.1%   \nSystem SSS  |  (2.1)%  |  3.9%  |  (1.3)%  |  7.3%   \n  \n**Jack in the Box Restaurant Counts** (2) **:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nStore count at beginning of FY  |  142  |  2,044  |  2,186  |  146  |  2,035  |  2,181   \nNew  |  8  |  22  |  30  |  2  |  18  |  20   \nRefranchised  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (5  |  )  |  5  |  —   \nClosed  |  —  |  (25  |  )  |  (25  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  (14  |  )  |  (15  |  )   \nStore count at end of Q4  |  150  |  2,041  |  2,191  |  142  |  2,044  |  2,186   \nNet Unit Increase/ (Decrease)  |  8  |  (3  |  )  |  5   \nQ4 2024 vs. Q4 2023 Unit % Decrease  |  5.6  |  %  |  (0.1  |  )%  |  0.2  |  %   \n  \n** Del Taco Performance **\n\nSame-store sales decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024, comprised of franchise same-store sales decrease of 4.2% and company-operated same-store sales decrease of 3.0%.

For fiscal year 2024, Del Taco opened 14 new restaurants, and was net positive 2 restaurants. Del Taco signed 70 total restaurant commitments in fiscal year 2024, with 42 commitments directly resulting from refranchising transactions. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin (3) , was 9.3% for the fourth quarter, a decrease from 14.8% in the prior year period. This decrease was primarily driven by transaction declines, as well as inflationary increases in wages and commodities, slightly offset by menu price increases and a change in the mix of restaurants. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin (3) , was 26.5% for the fourth quarter, a decrease from 32.5% one year ago. The decrease was driven by higher information technology expenses and the impact of refranchising transactions and the related increase of the pass through rent and marketing fees. \n\n**Del Taco Same-Store Sales:**\n\n**12 Weeks Ended** |  **52 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023** |  **September 29, 2024** |  **October 1, 2023**  \nCompany  |  (3.0)%  |  (1.4)%  |  (1.3)%  |  2.0%   \nFranchise  |  (4.2)%  |  (1.5)%  |  (1.6)%  |  1.4%   \nSystem  |  (3.9)%  |  (1.5)%  |  (1.5)%  |  1.7%   \n  \n**Del Taco Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nStore count at beginning of FY  |  171  |  421  |  592  |  290  |  301  |  591   \nNew  |  3  |  11  |  14  |  —  |  14  |  14   \nAcquired from franchisees  |  10  |  (10  |  )  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nRefranchised  |  (47  |  )  |  47  |  —  |  (111  |  )  |  111  |  —   \nClosed  |  (4  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (12  |  )  |  (8  |  )  |  (5  |  )  |  (13  |  )   \nStore count at end of Q4  |  133  |  461  |  594  |  171  |  421  |  592   \nNet Unit Increase/ (Decrease)  |  (38  |  )  |  40  |  2   \nQ4 2024 vs. Q4 2023 Restaurant % Decrease  |  (22.2  |  )%  |  9.5  |  %  |  0.3  |  %   \n  \n** Company-Wide Performance **\n\nTotal revenues decreased 6.2% in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $349.3 million, as compared to $372.5 million in the prior year fourth quarter. \n\nSG&A expense for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $30.0 million, a decrease of $13.7 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter, driven primarily by COLI gains in the fourth quarter as compared to losses in the prior year quarter, as well as lower incentive compensation and lower litigation charges. \n\nRestaurant impairment charges for the fourth quarter of 2024 were $7.9 million, which included $5.4 million relating to Jack in the Box restaurants, and $2.5 million relating to Del Taco restaurants. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA (5) , was $65.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $68.4 million for the prior year quarter. \n\nNet earnings was $21.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $21.9 million for the prior year fourth quarter. \n\nDiluted earnings per share was $1.12 for the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared with $1.08 in the prior year fourth quarter.

Management believes Operating Earnings Per Share provides investors with a meaningful supplement of the company’s operating performance and period-over-period changes without regard to potential distortions. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income.

Restaurant-Level Margin excludes revenues and expenses of our franchise operations and certain costs, such as selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening costs, goodwill impairment, other operating expenses, net, gains or losses on the sale of company-operated restaurants, and other costs that are considered normal operating costs. As such, Restaurant-Level Margin is not indicative of the overall results of the company and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Restaurant-Level Margin should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. The company is presenting Restaurant-Level Margin because it believes that it provides a meaningful supplement to net earnings of the company's core business operating results, as well as a comparison to those of other similar companies.

Franchise-Level Margin excludes revenue and expenses of our company-operated restaurants and certain costs, such as selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, pre-opening, goodwill impairment, other operating expenses, net, and other costs that are considered normal operating costs. As such, Franchise-Level Margin is not indicative of the overall results of the company and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Franchise-Level Margin should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. The company is presenting Franchise-Level Margin because it believes that it provides a meaningful supplement to net earnings of the company's core business operating results, as well as a comparison to those of other similar companies.

Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ: JACK), a Delaware corporation (the “Company” or “Jack in the Box”), founded and headquartered in San\nDiego, California, is a restaurant company that operates and franchises Jack in the Box®, one of the nation's largest hamburger chains with approximately\n2,200 restaurants across 22 states, and Del Taco®, one of the nation’s largest Mexican-American quick service restaurants (“QSR”) chains with approximately\n600 restaurants across 17 states.\nReferences to the Company throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K are made using the first person notations of “we”, “us” and “our.”\nRestaurant Brands\nJack in the Box. Jack in the Box restaurants offer a broad selection of distinctive products including classic burgers like its Jumbo Jack® and innovative\nproduct lines such as the Buttery Jack® and Smash Jack® burgers. Jack in the Box also offers quality products such as breakfast sandwiches with freshly\ncracked eggs, as well as craveable favorites such as tacos, curly fries, egg rolls, specialty sandwiches and real ice cream shakes, among many other items. Jack\nin the Box allows its guests to customize meals to their tastes and order any product on the menu when they want it, including breakfast at night, or burgers and\nchicken in the morning. The Jack in the Box trademark of variety and innovation has led to the development of five true day parts: breakfast, lunch, snack,\ndinner, and late night.\nJack in the Box opened its first restaurant in 1951 and has since become one of the nation’s largest hamburger chains. Based on number of restaurants, the\ntop 10 major markets of Jack in the Box comprise approximately 70% of the total system, and Jack in the Box is at least the third largest QSR hamburger chain\nin each of those major markets. As of September 29, 2024, Jack in the Box operated and franchised 2,191 quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western\nand southern United States, including two in Guam and two in Mexico. Of those total Jack in the Box restaurants at fiscal year-end, 2,041, or 93%, were\nfranchised.\nDel Taco. Del Taco offers a unique variety of both Mexican and American favorites such as burritos and fries, prepared fresh in every restaurant's kitchen\nwith the value and convenience of a drive-thru. Del Taco's menu items taste better because they are made with quality ingredients like freshly grilled chicken\nand carne asada steak, fresh house-made guacamole, freshly grated cheddar cheese, slow-cooked beans made from scratch, and creamy Queso Blanco.\nFounded in 1964, today Del Taco serves more than three million guests each week at its restaurants. Del Taco’s commitment to providing guests with the\nbest quality and value for their money originates from cooking, chopping, shredding, and grilling menu items from scratch. As of September 29, 2024, Del\nTaco operated and franchised 594 restaurants. Of those total Del Taco restaurants at fiscal year-end, 461, or 78%, were franchised.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur strategies are rooted in two foundational principles:\n• Shape a High-Performance Culture - When we serve our people and our franchisees well, we will maximize the guest experience for all who\ninteract with the brand.\n• Leverage Innovation and Technology Platforms - Taking our history of strong innovation on menu and operations and placing that same forward\nthinking on digital and technology development.\nWe use these principles as a guide while executing on our four strategic pillars:\n• Build Brand Loyalty by transforming our restaurant design, improving the image of existing restaurants, and enhancing the digital experience for our\nguests.\n• Drive Operations Excellence by evolving training efforts in our restaurants, execution of our brand standard systems, and improving speed and\nconsistency.\n• Grow Restaurant Profits by developing and implementing financial fundamentals, influencing pricing with a dynamic model, and building our data\nadvantage.\n• Expand Our Brands Reach by creating modular and flexible restaurant designs, building company-operated stores to help seed growth, and\nincreasing franchise candidate and restaurant site lead generations.\n3\nThis strategy builds on our historical strengths with our Jack in the Box and Del Taco differentiated, challenger brands. Those strengths include our\nuniquely broad menus, operational capabilities, passionate and loyal guests, committed team members and franchisees, and ability to invest in development and\ninnovation that will deliver long term growth.\nDel Taco Refranchising Strategy\nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued our refranchising strategy with three main intentions. First, to create a company-wide asset-light model that will benefit\nfrom mitigating exposure to macroeconomic pressures; second, to generate incremental development agreements throughout the refranchising process that\nprovide a more robust unit growth pipeline than otherwise achievable; and third, to provide a more efficient capital structure.\nOur objective is to be asset-light as we navigate market forces. We refranchised 47 Del Taco restaurants in fiscal year 2024, and 111 Del Taco restaurants\nin 2023. In connection with the 2024 refranchising, we added 42 new development commitments. Throughout 2025, we will continue refranchising and adjust\nthe rate, pace and sequence of those efforts to balance the impact to earnings.\nFranchising Program\nJack in the Box. The franchise agreement generally provides for an initial franchise fee of $50,000 per restaurant for a 20-year term, and royalty and\nmarketing payments generally set at 5.0% of gross sales. Royalty rates are typically 5.0% of gross sales with some legacy agreements at higher rates. Some\nexisting agreements provide for lower royalties for a limited time and may have variable rates. We may offer development agreements to franchisees (referred\nto in this context as “Developers”) for construction of one or more new restaurants over a defined period of time and in a defined geographic area. Developers\nmay be required to pay fees for certain company-sourced new sites. Developers may lose their rights to future development if they do not maintain the required\nopening schedule. To stimulate growth, we have offered an incentive program that provides discounted royalty fees for franchisees who maintain development\ncompliance and sign a Development Agreement for a minimum of three restaurants to be developed and opened under the development schedule during the\ntimeframe specified under the Development Agreement.\nDel Taco. The franchise agreement provides for an initial franchise fee of $35,000 per restaurant for a 20-year term, and royalty and marketing payments\ngenerally set at 5.0% and 4.0%, respectively, of gross sales. Some existing agreements provide for lower royalties for a limited time and may have variable\nrates. We may offer development agreements to franchisees for construction of one or more new restaurants over a defined period of time and in a defined\ngeographic area. Developers may be required to pay fees for certain company-sourced new sites. Developers may lose their rights to future development if they\ndo not maintain the required opening schedule. To stimulate growth, we have offered an incentive program that provides discounted royalty fees for multi-unit\nfranchisees who agree to develop multiple restaurants pursuant to a Development Agreement in certain markets we have identified for further development and\nthat we deem, in our sole determination, to be undeveloped, underdeveloped, or emerging in terms of the Del Taco brand’s market penetration; it is not\navailable in markets we deem to be mature in terms of the Del Taco brand’s market penetration.\nSite Selection and Design\nSite selection for all new Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurants is made after an economic analysis and a review of demographic data and other\ninformation relating to population density, traffic, competition, restaurant visibility and access, available parking, surrounding businesses, and opportunities for\nmarket penetration. New restaurants developed by franchisees are built to brand standards that we have approved.\nJack in the Box offers three prototypical “CRAVED” image restaurant designs, and Del Taco offers three prototypical “Fresh Flex” image restaurant\ndesigns, each that feature the same kitchen engine but different dining room configurations to provide maximum flexibility when considering properties for\ndevelopment. This flexibility enables the Company and franchisees to optimize the layout and configuration of a new restaurant with the property’s specific\neconomic, demographic, geographic, or physical characteristics. Included in the prototype offering is an off-premise-only restaurant, which is designed to meet\nthe continued increasing demand for drive-thru service and digital ordering. The prototype portfolios are designed for free-standing locations but can be\nadapted to fit in a variety of spaces such as conversions, c-stores, travel plazas, and end-cap locations.\nThe Jack in the Box restaurants are approximately 1,372 square feet, the restaurant can support a Y-Lane drive-thru configuration, provides a walk-up\nwindow for ordering, dual assembly kitchens, and a dedicated pick-up window for mobile and third-party delivery orders. The goal of this design is to reduce\nbuild out costs, while also increasing real estate flexibility. In addition, an approximate 2,003 square foot, 22-seat dining room building, and an approximate\n2,450 square foot 50-seat dining room building designs are available.\n4\nThe Del Taco restaurants are approximately 1,152 square feet, the restaurant can support a Y-Lane drive-thru configuration, provides a walk-up window for\nordering and a dedicated pick-up window or lockers for mobile and third-party delivery orders. The goal of this design is to reduce build out costs, while also\nincreasing real estate flexibility. In addition, an approximate 2,021 square-foot, 34-seat dining room building, and an approximate 2,304 square-foot 48-seat\ndining room building designs are available.\nRestaurant Management and Operations\nJack in the Box and Del Taco restaurants are operated by a company manager or franchise operator who is directly responsible for the operations of the\nrestaurant, including product quality, service, food safety, cleanliness, inventory, cash control, and the conduct and appearance of employees. We focus on\nattracting, selecting, engaging, and retaining employees and franchisees who share our passion for creating long-lasting, successful restaurants.\nAt both brands, company-operated restaurant managers are supervised by district managers, who are overseen by director of operations, who report to vice\npresident of operations.\nJack in the Box. Restaurant managers are required to complete an extensive management training program involving a combination of in-restaurant\ninstruction and on-the-job training in specially designated training restaurants. Restaurant managers and supervisory personnel train other restaurant employees\nin accordance with detailed procedures and guidelines using training aids available at each location.\nDel Taco. Restaurant managers, assistant managers, shift managers and team leaders are certified through a series of online and on the job training\nmodules. Every team member receives training modules focused on helping the team member clearly understand the brand and their role as well as modules\nfocusing on the specifics of how to provide a consistent customer experience, how to complete specific tasks for their assigned position and ensure food safety.\nThe training program is a blended learning approach including e-learning courses, hands-on exercises, and online knowledge validation tests. Before\ncertification, shift managers attend a 2-hour virtual training, assistant managers attend a 1-day in person class and general managers attend a 2 day in-person\nclass, all led by the training department or certified trainer.\nFood Safety\nOur “farm-to-fork” food safety program is designed to maintain high standards for the food products and food preparation procedures used by our vendors\nand in our restaurants. We maintain product specifications for our ingredients and our Food Safety and Technical Services Department must approve all\nsuppliers of food products to our restaurants. We use third-party and internal audits to review the food safety management programs of our vendors. We\nmanage food safety in our restaurants through a comprehensive food safety management program that is based on the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”)\nFood Code requirements. The food safety management program includes employee training, ingredient testing, documented restaurant practices, and attention\nto product safety at each stage of the food preparation cycle. In addition, our food safety management program uses American National Standards Institute\ncertified food safety training programs to train our company and franchise restaurant management employees on food safety practices for our restaurants.\nSupply Chain\nAt both brands, we contract with a single primary food service distributor for substantially all of our food and supplies. Under the current contracts, this\ndistributor will provide distribution services to both our Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurants through August 2027.\nThe primary commodities purchased by Jack in the Box restaurants are beef, poultry, pork, cheese, and produce. Taco meat is the largest commodity\npurchased by Del Taco. We monitor and purchase commodities in order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and supply. Contracts are entered into\nand commodity market positions may be secured when we consider them to be advantageous. However, certain commodities remain subject to price\nfluctuations. Most, if not all, essential food and beverage products are available or can be made available upon short notice from alternative qualified suppliers.\nInformation Systems\nOur Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurant software allows for daily polling of sales, inventory, and other data from the restaurants directly. Our\ncompany restaurants and traditional-site franchise restaurants use standardized Android and Windows-based touch screen point-of-sale (“POS”) platforms.\nThese platforms allow the restaurants to accept cash, credit cards, and our re-loadable gift cards. The single POS system for all restaurants helps franchisees\nand brand managers adapt more quickly to meet consumer demands and introduce new products, pricing, promotions, and technologies such as the Jack in the\nBox and Del Taco mobile apps, third party delivery, or any other business-driving initiative while maintaining a secure, PCI-compliant payment system. We\nalso provide an ordering website and integrated mobile app featuring a full array of capabilities including full menu ordering, customization options, location\nfinder, product and restaurant information, flexible delivery or pickup options and an integrated loyalty program.\n5\nWe have business intelligence systems that provide us with visibility to the key metrics in the operation of Jack in the Box and Del Taco company and\nfranchise restaurants. These systems play an integral role in enabling us to accumulate and analyze market information. Our restaurants use labor scheduling\nsystems to assist managers in managing labor hours based on forecasted sales volumes. We also have inventory management systems that enable timely and\naccurate deliveries of food and packaging to our restaurants. To support order accuracy and speed of service, our Jack in the Box drive-thru restaurants use\norder confirmation screens.\nAdvertising and Promotion\nOur brands run highly coordinated marketing and advertising campaigns to create customer awareness, engage fans, and maximize positive brand\nassociations. We build brand awareness and drive sales through our marketing and advertising programs. These activities are supported primarily by financial\ncontributions to a marketing fund from all company and franchise restaurants based on a percentage of gross sales. We use multiple marketing channels to\nbroadly drive brand awareness, which include, but are not limited to, television, connected TV, radio, digital and social media, outdoor and direct mail. We may\nutilize local radio, print, internet advertising, and billboards for some of the less developed markets, reaching consumers through our branded mobile app and\ndelivery partnerships.\nCompetition and Markets\nThe restaurant business is highly competitive and is affected by local and national economic conditions, including unemployment levels, population and\nsocioeconomic trends, traffic patterns, local and national competitive changes, changes in consumer dining habits and preferences, and new information\nregarding diet, nutrition, and health, all of which may affect consumer spending habits. Key elements of competition in the industry are the quality and\ninnovation in the food products offered, price and perceived value, quality of service experience (including technological and other innovations), speed of\nservice, personnel, advertising and other marketing efforts, name identification, restaurant location, and image and attractiveness of the facilities.\nEach Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurant competes directly and indirectly with a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, some of\nwhich have significantly greater financial resources, as well as with locally-owned or independent restaurants in the quick-service and the fast-casual segments,\nand with other consumer options including grocery and specialty or convenience stores, catering, and delivery services. In selling franchises, we compete with\nmany other restaurant franchisors, some of whom have substantially greater financial resources than we do.\nHuman Capital Management\nJack in the Box and Del Taco recognizes and takes care of its employees by paying competitive wages and offering a wide range of benefits and\nrecognition programs. We are proud of our employees, many who began their career in our restaurants as their first entry-level job, are given the opportunity to\ngrow and advance their careers as we invest in their education and career development.\nAs of September 29, 2024, for our combined brands, we had 8,168 employees, of whom 7,542 were restaurant employees, 571 were corporate\nmanagement and staff, and 55 were field operations management. Most of our employees are paid on an hourly basis, except for district and restaurant\nmanagers, and certain restaurant support center management and staff positions. We employ both full-time and part-time restaurant employees in order to\nprovide the flexibility necessary during peak periods of restaurant operations and meet the individual needs of our employees. As of the end of fiscal 2024,\napproximately 87% of our restaurant employees were part-time. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages.\nOur Total Rewards framework includes pay and recognition, health and wellness, financial well-being, work/life happiness, culture and community, and\nlearning and development. We take care in providing employees with market-competitive pay and benefits and flexibility with respect to benefit choices. For\nour company-operated restaurant positions nationwide, positions are assigned to a pay range that best reflects geographic market pricing of similar jobs in the\nrestaurant industry, and additionally for restaurants in CA, pay requirements under AB 1228 regulation. Employees’ pay is reviewed annually. All restaurant\nsupport center positions, and restaurant management positions, including hourly assistant managers and team leaders, are eligible for performance-based cash\nincentives. Each incentive plan reinforces and rewards individuals for achievement of specific company and/or restaurant business goals.\nWe regularly review the pay of our female and male employees to ensure pay equity for performing equal or substantially similar work. We share the\nmedian pay of our male and female employees in various position classifications with the Board of Directors, and we take remedial action as appropriate to\nensure pay equity is maintained.\n6\nWe offer a robust benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision insurance and an HMO plan; company-paid basic term life insurance; wellness\nprograms; an employee assistance program (“EAP”); life and disability insurance; flexible spending accounts (“FSA”) and health savings accounts (“HSA”)\nwith employer contributions; legal services; pet insurance; and a 401(k) with company matching contributions. In addition, we recognize and support the\ngrowth and development of our employees and offer opportunities to participate in internal and external learning programs. We also hold regular restaurant\nlevel talent and development planning reviews to assist us with growing our internal restaurant teams.\nWe recognize our responsibility to take the steps necessary to create and maintain a safe and healthy work environment. All of our corporate and restaurant\nemployees may report safety and security issues either through our risk management department or anonymously through our asset protection helpline. Reports\nare reviewed by our asset protection manager and are addressed appropriately by corporate partners and OSHA, if necessary. All of our corporate and\nrestaurant employees may also report any ethics issues to our ethics hotline. We take every incident and report seriously and have detailed protocols regarding\ninvestigation, assessment and correction, safety communications, employee training, and record keeping.\nTrademarks and Service Marks\nThe JACK IN THE BOX® and DEL TACO® names and logos are of material importance to us and are registered trademarks and service marks in the\nUnited States and elsewhere. In addition, we have registered or applied to register numerous service marks and trade names for use in our businesses, including\nthe Jack in the Box and Del Taco design marks and various product names and designs. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and\ntrademarks and to vigorously oppose any infringement of them. Generally, with the appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and\ntrademarks will continue indefinitely.\nSeasonality\nRestaurant sales and profitability are subject to seasonal fluctuations because of factors such as vacation and holiday travel, seasonal weather conditions,\nand weather crises, all of which affect the public’s dining habits.\nGovernment Regulation\nEach restaurant is subject to regulation by federal agencies, as well as licensing and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, safety, fire, zoning,\nbuilding, consumer protection, taxing, and other agencies and departments. Restaurants are also subject to rules and regulations imposed by owners and\noperators of shopping centers, airports, or other locations where a restaurant is located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining any required\npermits, licenses or approvals, or difficulties in complying with applicable rules and regulations, could result in restricted operations, closures of existing\nrestaurants, delays or cancellations in the opening of new restaurants, increased cost of operations, or the imposition of fines and other penalties.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local laws governing restaurant menu labeling, as well as laws restricting the use of, or requiring disclosures about,\ncertain ingredients used in food sold at our restaurants. We are also subject to federal, state, and local laws governing packaging and service ware.\nWe are also subject to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations of such laws.\nSuch laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may also apply substantive standards to the\nrelationship between franchisor and franchisee, including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements.\nWe are subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and various state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, exempt status classification,\novertime, breaks and other working conditions for Company employees. Our franchisees are subject to these same laws. Many of our food service personnel\nare paid at rates set in relation to the federal and state minimum wage laws and, accordingly, changes in the minimum wage requirements may increase labor\ncosts for us and our franchisees. Federal and state laws may also require us to provide paid and unpaid leave, or healthcare or other employee benefits to our\nemployees, which could result in significant additional expense to us and our franchisees. We are also subject to federal immigration laws requiring compliance\nwith work authorization documentation and verification procedures.\nWe are subject to certain guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and various state codes and regulations, which require restaurants\nand our brands to provide full and equal access to persons with certain mental or physical impairments.\nOur collection or use of personal information about our employees or our guests is regulated at the federal and state levels, including the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) and other similar state and federal laws.\n7\nOur marketing, advertising, and promotional programs are governed by various federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning consumer\nprotection, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and other similar state and federal laws.\nWe are also subject to various federal, state, and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. The cost of complying with these\nlaws increases the cost of operating existing restaurants and developing new restaurants. Additional costs relate primarily to the necessity of obtaining more\nland, landscaping, storm drainage control, and the cost of more expensive equipment necessary to decrease the amount of effluent emitted into the air, ground,\nand surface waters.\nIn addition to laws and regulations governing restaurant businesses directly, there are also regulations, such as the Food Safety Modernization Act, that\ngovern the practices of food manufacturers and distributors, including our suppliers.\nWe have processes in place to monitor compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing our Company operations.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s corporate website can be found at www.jackinthebox.com. We make available free of charge at this website (under the caption “Investors\n— Financials — SEC Filings”) all of our reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports. These reports are\nmade available on the website as soon as reasonably practicable after their filing with, or furnishing to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The\nSEC also maintains a website with the address of www.sec.gov that contains our reports, proxy and information statements, and other information.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could\ncause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from projections in the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our\nother filings with the SEC, in our news releases, and in oral statements by our representatives. However, other factors that we do not anticipate or that we do\nnot consider material based on currently available information may also have an adverse effect on our results.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic and Industry Conditions\nChanges in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages,\nscheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and\nretain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs and inflationary and other pressure on wages now being\nexperienced. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system\nof internal controls, and to train employees to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business\nand results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for restaurant positions, including due to\nconcerns around and illnesses arising from COVID-19 and its various novel variants and other factors, which could decrease the pool of available qualified\ntalent for key functions and require restaurants to operate on reduced hours. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and\nretain the top performing employees especially in a rising wage market.\nChanges in consumer confidence and declines in general economic conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe restaurant industry depends on consumer discretionary spending. We are impacted by consumer confidence, which is, in turn, influenced by general\neconomic conditions and discretionary income levels. A material decline in consumer confidence or a decline in family “food away from home” spending could\ncause our financial results to decline. If economic conditions worsen, customer traffic could be adversely impacted if our customers choose to dine out less\nfrequently or reduce the amount they spend on meals while dining out, which could cause our company and our franchised average restaurant sales to decline.\nAn economic downturn may be caused by a variety of factors, such as macro-economic changes, increased unemployment rates, increased taxes, interest rates,\nor other changes in government fiscal policy. High gasoline prices, increased healthcare costs, declining home prices, and political unrest, foreign or domestic,\nmay potentially contribute to an economic downturn, as may regional or local events, including natural disasters or local regulation. The impact of these factors\nmay be exacerbated by the geographic profile of our brands. Specifically, approximately 70% of our systemwide restaurants are located in the states of\nCalifornia and Texas. Economic conditions, state and local laws, or government regulations affecting those states may therefore more greatly impact our results\nthan would similar occurrences in other locations.\n8\nIncreases in food and commodity costs could decrease our profit margins or result in a modified menu, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to volatility in food and commodity costs and availability. Accordingly, our profitability depends in part on our ability\nto anticipate and react to changes in food costs and availability. As is true of all companies in the restaurant industry, we are susceptible to increases in food\ncosts that are outside of our control. Factors that can impact food and commodity costs include general economic conditions, inflation, labor shortages,\nseasonal fluctuations, weather and climate conditions, energy costs, global demand, trade protections and subsidies, food safety issues, infectious diseases,\npossible terrorist activity, cyberattacks, transportation issues, currency fluctuations, product recalls, and government regulatory schemes. Additionally, some of\nour produce, meats, and restaurant supplies are sourced from outside the United States. Any new or increased import duties, tariffs, or taxes, or other changes in\nU.S. trade or tax policy, could result in higher food and commodity costs that would adversely impact our financial results.\nWeather and climate related issues, such as freezes or drought, may lead to temporary or even longer-term spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as\nproduce and meats, or of livestock feed. Increasing weather volatility or other long-term changes in global weather patterns, including any changes associated\nwith global climate change, could have a significant impact on the price or availability of some of our ingredients. Any increase in the prices of the ingredients\nmost critical to our menu, such as beef, chicken, pork, tomatoes, lettuce, dairy products, and potatoes could adversely affect our financial results. In the event of\ncost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to change our pricing or suspend serving a menu item rather than paying the\nincreased cost for the particular ingredient.\nWe seek to manage food and commodity costs, including through extended fixed price contracts, strong category and commodity management, and\npurchasing fundamentals. However, certain commodities such as beef and pork do not lend themselves to fixed price contracts. We cannot assure you that we\nwill successfully enter into fixed price contracts on a timely basis or on commercially favorable pricing terms. In addition, although our produce contracts\ncontain predetermined price limits, we are subject to force majeure clauses resulting from weather or acts of God that may result in temporary spikes in costs.\nFurther, we cannot assure you that we or our franchisees will be able to successfully anticipate and react effectively to changing food and commodity costs\nby adjusting purchasing practices or menu offerings. We and our franchisees also may not be able to pass along price increases to our customers as a result of\nadverse economic conditions, competitive pricing, or other factors. Therefore, variability of food and other commodity costs could adversely affect our\nprofitability and results of operations.\nFailure to receive scheduled deliveries of high-quality food ingredients and other supplies could harm our operations and reputation.\nDependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and other food products subjects food service businesses such as ours to the risk that shortages or\ninterruptions in supply could adversely affect the availability, quality or cost of ingredients or require us to incur additional costs to obtain adequate supplies.\nDeliveries of supplies may be affected by adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, labor shortages, or financial or solvency issues of our distributors or\nsuppliers, product recalls, production disruptions such as mechanical failures, or other issues. Further, increases in fuel prices could result in increased\ndistribution costs. In addition, if any of our distributors, suppliers, vendors, or other contractors fail to meet our quality or safety standards or otherwise do not\nperform adequately, or if any one or more of them seeks to terminate its agreement or fails to perform as anticipated, or if there is any disruption in any of our\ndistribution or supply relationships or operations for any reason, our business reputation, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially\naffected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has affected and could continue to materially affect our\noperations, financial condition, and results of operations for an extended period of time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, federal, state and local government responses to COVID-19 and our responses to the outbreak have all disrupted and\nmay continue to disrupt our business. Our operating results substantially depend upon our sales volumes, restaurant profitability, and financial stability, and to\nthe extent we and/or our franchisees experience financial distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating results may be adversely impacted, potentially\nmaterially affecting our liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business has been disrupted and could be further disrupted to the extent our suppliers, distributors, and/or third-party delivery partners are adversely\nimpacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers, distributors, and/or third-party delivery partners experience labor shortages or their employees are\nunable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, we could face cost\nincreases, shortages of food items, shortages of delivery services, and/or shortages of other supplies across our restaurants, and our results could be adversely\nimpacted by such interruptions.\n9\nThe COVID-19 outbreak also may have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed herein, including, but not limited to, those related to consumer\nconfidence, increase in food and commodity costs, supply chain interruptions, labor availability and cost, cybersecurity incidents, increased indebtedness,\nregulatory and legal complexity, governmental regulations, and our stock price.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nInability to attract, train and retain top-performing personnel could adversely impact our financial results or business.\nWe believe that our continued success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain the services of skilled personnel. The loss of the services of,\nor our inability to attract and retain, such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, including reduced restaurant operating hours. We\nbelieve good managers and crew are a key part of our success, and we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our restaurant managers and crew.\nWe aim to reduce turnover among our restaurant crews and managers in an effort to retain top performing employees and better realize our investment in\ntraining new employees. Any failure to do so may adversely impact our operating results by increasing training costs and making it more difficult to deliver\noutstanding customer service, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs.\nLabor is a primary component of our operating costs. Increased labor costs due to factors such as competition for workers, labor shortages, labor market\npressures, increased minimum wage requirements, paid sick leave or vacation accrual mandates, or other legal or regulatory changes, such as predictive\nscheduling, may adversely impact operating costs for us and our franchisees. Additional taxes or requirements to incur additional employee benefit costs,\nincluding the requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) or any new or replacement healthcare requirements,\ncould also adversely impact our operating costs.\nThe enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases above federal wage rates or regulations related to non-exempt employees has increased\nand could continue to increase labor costs for employees across our system-wide operations. Labor related laws enacted at the federal, state, provincial or local\nlevel could increase our and our franchisees’ labor costs and decrease profitability.\nUnionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability.\nSome or all of our employees or our franchisees’ employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If a significant number of these\nemployees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from current compensation arrangements, this\ncould adversely affect our business and financial results or the business and financial results of our franchisees. In addition, a labor dispute or organizing effort\ninvolving some or all of our employees or our franchisees’ employees may harm our brand and reputation. Resolution of such disputes may be costly and time-\nconsuming, and thus increase our costs and distract management resources.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance policies customary for businesses of our size, type, and experience. Historically, through the use of deductibles or\nself-insurance retentions, we retained a portion of expected losses for our workers’ compensation, general liability, certain employee medical and dental,\nemployment, property, and other claims. However, there are types of losses that we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not\neconomically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Restaurant Industry\nWe face significant competition in the food service industry and our inability to compete may adversely affect our business.\nThe food service industry is highly competitive with respect to price, service, location, product offering, image and attractiveness of the facilities,\npersonnel, advertising, brand identification, and food quality. Our competition includes a large number of national and regional restaurant chains, as well as\nlocally owned and independent businesses. In particular, we operate in the quick service restaurant chain segment, in which we face a number of established\ncompetitors, as well as frequent new entrants to the segment nationally and in regional markets. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial,\nmarketing, technological, personnel, and other resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have greater name recognition nationally or in some\nof the local or regional markets in which we have restaurants.\n10\nAdditionally, the trend toward convergence in grocery, deli, delivery, and restaurant services is increasing the number of our competitors. For example,\ncompetitive pressures can come from deli sections and in-store cafes of major grocery store chains, including those targeted at customers who desire high-\nquality food and convenience, as well as from convenience stores and other dining outlets. These competitors may have, among other things, a more diverse\nmenu, lower operating costs and prices, better locations, better facilities, more effective marketing, and more efficient operations than we do. Such increased\ncompetition could decrease the demand for our products and negatively affect our sales, operating results, profits, business and financial position, and prospects\n(collectively, our “financial results”).\nWhile we continue to make improvements to our facilities, to implement new service, technology, and training initiatives, and to introduce new products,\nthere can be no assurance that such efforts will generate increased sales or sufficient customer interest. Many of our competitors are remodeling their facilities,\nimplementing service improvements, introducing a variety of new products and service offerings, and advertising that their ingredients are healthier or locally\nsourced. Such competing products and health- or environmental-focused claims may hurt our competitive positioning as existing or potential customers could\nseek out other dining options.\nChanges in demographic trends and in customer tastes and preferences could cause sales and the royalties that we receive from franchisees to decline.\nChanges in customer preferences, demographic trends, and the number, type, and location of competing restaurants have great impact in the restaurant\nindustry. Our sales and the revenue that we receive from franchisees could be impacted by changes in customer preferences related to dietary concerns, such as\npreferences regarding calories, sodium content, carbohydrates, fat, additives, and sourcing, or in response to environmental and animal welfare concerns. Such\npreference changes could result in customers favoring other foods to the exclusion of our menu items. If we fail to adapt to changes in customer preferences\nand trends, we may lose customers and our sales and the rents, royalties, and marketing fees we receive from franchisees may deteriorate.\nNegative publicity relating to our business or industry could adversely impact our reputation.\nOur business can be materially and adversely affected by widespread negative publicity of any type, particularly regarding food quality, food safety,\nnutritional content, safety or public health issues (such as outbreaks, pandemics, epidemics, or the prospect of any of these), obesity or other health concerns,\nanimal welfare issues, and employee relations issues, among other things. Adverse publicity in these areas could damage the trust customers place in our\nbrands. The increasingly widespread use of mobile devices and social media platforms has amplified the speed and scope of adverse publicity and could\nhamper our ability to promptly correct misrepresentations or otherwise respond effectively to negative publicity, whether or not accurate. Any widespread\nnegative publicity regarding the Company, our brands, our vendors and suppliers, and our franchisees, or negative publicity about the restaurant industry in\ngeneral, whether or not accurate, could cause a decline in restaurant sales, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nAdditionally, employee or customer claims against us or our franchisees based on, among other things, wage and hour violations, discrimination,\nharassment, or wrongful termination may also create negative publicity that could adversely affect us and divert financial and management resources that\nwould otherwise be focused on the future performance of our operations. Consumer demand for our products could decrease significantly if any such incidents\nor other matters create negative publicity or otherwise erode consumer confidence in us, our brands or our products, or in the restaurant industry in general.\nWe are also subject to the risk of negative publicity associated with animal welfare regulations and campaigns. Our restaurants utilize ingredients\nmanufactured from beef, poultry, and pork. Our policies require that our approved food suppliers and their raw material providers engage in proper animal\nwelfare practices. Despite our policies and efforts, media reports and portrayals of inhumane acts toward animals by participants in the food supply chain,\nwhether by our suppliers or not, can create a negative opinion or perception of the food industry’s animal welfare efforts. Such media reports and negative\npublicity could impact guest perception of our brands or industry and can have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may not have the same resources as our competitors for marketing, advertising, and promotion.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to: invest significantly more than us in advertising, particularly television and\nradio ads, as well as endorsements and sponsorships; have a presence across more media channels; and support multiple system and regional product launches\nat one time. Should our competitors increase spending on marketing, advertising, and promotion, or should the cost of advertising increase or our advertising\nfunds decrease for any reason (including reduced sales, implementation of reduced spending strategies, or a decrease in the percentage contribution to our\nmarketing funds for any reason), our results of operations and financial condition may be materially impacted.\n11\nIn addition, our financial results may be harmed if our marketing, advertising, and promotional programs are less effective than those of our\ncompetitors. The growing prevalence and importance of social media platforms, behavioral advertising, and mobile technology also pose challenges and risks\nfor our marketing, advertising, and promotional strategies; and failure to effectively use and gain traction on these platforms or technologies could cause our\nadvertising to be less effective than our competitors. Moreover, improper or damaging use of social media or mobile technology, including by our employees,\nfranchisees, or guests could increase our costs, lead to litigation, or result in negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial results.\nWe may be adversely impacted by severe weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts, or civil unrest that could result in property damage, injury to\nemployees and staff, and lost restaurant sales.\nFood service businesses such as ours can be materially and adversely affected by severe weather conditions, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding,\nprolonged drought, or protracted heat or cold waves, and by natural disasters, such as earthquakes and wildfires, or “man-made” calamities such as terrorist\nincidents or civil unrest, and their aftermath. Such occurrences could result in lost restaurant sales, property damage, lost products, interruptions in supply, and\nincreased costs.\nIf systemic or widespread adverse changes in climate or weather patterns occur, we could experience more severe impact, which could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial results. The impact of these factors may be exacerbated by our geographic profile, as approximately 70% of our restaurants are\nlocated in the states of California and Texas.\nRisks Relating to Health and Safety\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing demand and increasing costs.\nFood safety is a top priority for our company, and we expend significant resources on food safety programs to ensure that our customers are able to enjoy\nsafe and high-quality food products. These include a daily, structured food safety assessment and documentation process at our restaurants, and periodic third-\nparty and internal audits to review the food safety performance of our vendors, distributors, and restaurants. Nonetheless, food safety risks cannot be\ncompletely eliminated, and food safety and food-borne illness issues do occur in the food service industry. Any report or publicity linking us to instances of\nfood-borne illness or other food safety issues, including issues involving food tampering, natural or foreign objects, or other contaminants or adulterants in our\nfood, could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our financial results. Furthermore, our reliance on food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that\nfood-borne illness incidents could be introduced by third-party vendors outside our direct control. Although we test and audit these activities, we cannot\nguarantee that all food items are safely and properly maintained during transport or distribution throughout the supply chain.\nAdditionally, past reports linking nationwide or regional incidents of food-borne illnesses such as salmonella, E. coli, and listeria to certain products such\nas produce and proteins, or human-influenced illness such as hepatitis A or norovirus, have resulted in consumers avoiding certain products and restaurant\nconcepts for a period of time. Similarly, reaction to media-influenced reports of avian flu, incidents of “mad cow” disease, or similar concerns have also caused\nsome consumers to avoid products that are, or are suspected of being, affected and could have an adverse effect on the price and availability of affected\ningredients. Further, if we react to these problems by changing our menu or other key aspects of the brand experience, we may lose customers who do not\naccept those changes, and we may not be able to attract enough new customers to generate sufficient revenue to make our restaurants profitable.\nOur restaurants currently have an ingredient mix that can be exposed to one or more food allergens, such as eggs, wheat, milk, fish, shellfish, tree nuts,\npeanuts, sesame, and soy. We employ precautionary allergen training steps for food handlers in order to minimize risk of allergen cross contamination, and we\npost allergen information on nutritional posters in our restaurants or otherwise make such information available to guests upon request. Even with such\nprecautionary measures, the potential risk of allergen cross contamination exists in a restaurant environment. A potentially serious allergic reaction by a guest\nmay result in adverse public communication, media coverage, a decline in restaurant sales, and a material decline in our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model and Strategy\nWe may not achieve our development goals.\nWe intend to grow Jack in the Box and Del Taco primarily through new restaurant development by franchisees, both in existing markets and in new\nmarkets. Development involves substantial risks, including the risk of:\n• the inability to identify suitable franchisees;\n• limited availability of financing for the Company and for franchisees at acceptable rates and terms;\n• development costs exceeding budgeted or contracted amounts;\n• the negative impact of any re-imaging strategy if not adopted by franchisees or embraced by guests;\n12\n• delays in completion of construction or shortages of any equipment or construction materials;\n• competition for quality cost-efficient property that has a favorable zoning classification allowing drive-thru sales;\n• negative impact of delays due to lengthy supply chain lead times for building components and systems;\n• negative impact of delays due to longer timelines for permit review and field inspections with the municipal agencies;\n• negative impact of delays due to longer than usual design, permitting, approval, procurement, and field installation timelines for utility service\nproviders to supply primary services on new restaurant development projects (i.e., electrical, gas, sewer, water, etc.)\n• the inability to identify, or the unavailability of suitable sites at acceptable cost and other leasing or purchase terms;\n• developed properties not achieving desired revenue or cash flow levels once opened;\n• the negative impact of a new restaurant upon sales at nearby existing restaurants;\n• the challenge of developing in areas where competitors are more established or have greater penetration or access to suitable development sites;\n• incurring substantial unrecoverable costs in the event a development project is abandoned prior to completion;\n• impairment charges resulting from underperforming restaurants or decisions to curtail or cease investment in certain locations or markets;\n• in new geographic markets where we have limited or no existing locations, the inability to successfully expand or acquire critical market presence for\nour brands, acquire name recognition, successfully market our products, or attract new customers;\n• operating cost levels that reduce the demand for, or raise the cost of, developing new restaurants;\n• the challenge of identifying, recruiting, and training qualified franchisees or company restaurant management;\nAlthough we manage our growth and development activities to help reduce such risks, we cannot assure that our present or future growth and development\nactivities will perform in accordance with our expectations. Our inability to expand in accordance with our plans or to manage the risks associated with our\ngrowth could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe continued integration of the Jack in the Box and Del Taco businesses may be more difficult, time consuming, or costly than expected.\nThe combination of two independent businesses can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, and it may divert significant management attention and\nresources. This process may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete. The failure to realize the anticipated benefits of integrating the\ntwo businesses could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe overall combination of the Jack in the Box and Del Taco businesses may also result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities,\ncompetitive responses and impacts, and loss of customer and other business relationships. The difficulties of combining the operations include, among others:\n• difficulties in integrating operations and systems, including intellectual property and communications systems, administrative and information\ntechnology infrastructure, supplier and vendor arrangements and financial reporting and internal control systems;\n• challenges in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting policies and business cultures;\n• differences in control environments and cultures;\n• difficulties in integrating and aligning policies, principles and practices;\n• alignment of key performance measurements may result in a greater need to communicate and manage clear expectations while we work to integrate\nand align policies and practices;\n• difficulties in integrating employees and attracting and retaining key personnel;\n• challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n• difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, accretion targets, business opportunities, financing plans and growth prospects from the\ncombination; and\n• difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company.\nAdditionally, uncertainties over the integration process could cause customers, suppliers, distributors, and others to seek to change or cancel our existing\nbusiness relationships or to refuse to renew existing relationships. Competitors may also target our existing customers by highlighting potential uncertainties\nand integration difficulties.\nSome of these factors are outside our control, and any one of them could result in lower revenues, higher costs, and diversion of management time and\nenergy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n13\nOur highly-franchised business model presents a number of risks, and the failure of our franchisees to operate successful and profitable restaurants could\nnegatively impact our business.\nAs of September 29, 2024, approximately 93% of our Jack in the Box restaurants and 78% of Del Taco restaurants were franchised; therefore, our success\nincreasingly relies on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, yet we have limited influence over their operations. Our income arises from two\nsources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., royalties and rent based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, profit from our remaining Company-\noperated restaurants. Our franchisees manage their businesses independently, and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The\nrevenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. If our franchisees do not experience\nsales growth, our revenues and margins could be negatively affected as a result. Also, if sales trends worsen for franchisees, their financial results may\ndeteriorate, which could result in, among other things, franchisee bankruptcies, restaurant closures, or delayed or reduced payments to us. Our success also\nincreasingly depends on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees to implement shared strategies and major initiatives, which may include\nfinancial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating and promotional plans. Franchisees’ ability to contribute to the achievement of our plans is\ndependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general or\nby the credit worthiness of our franchisees or the Company. As small businesses, some of our franchise operators may be negatively and disproportionately\nimpacted by strategic initiatives, capital requirements, inflation, labor costs, employee relations issues, or other causes. In addition, franchisees’ business\nobligations may not be limited to the operation of restaurants, making them subject to business and financial risks unrelated to the operation of our restaurants.\nThese unrelated risks could adversely affect a franchisee’s ability to make payments to us or to make payments on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that our\nfranchisees will successfully participate in our strategic or marketing initiatives or operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our requirements,\nstandards, and expectations. As compared to some of our competitors, our brands have relatively fewer franchisees who, on average, operate more restaurants\nper franchisee. There are significant risks to our business if a franchisee, particularly one who operates a large number of restaurants, encounters financial\ndifficulties, including bankruptcy, or fails to adhere to our standards, projecting an image inconsistent with our brands or negatively impacting our financial\nresults.\nWe are subject to financial and regulatory risks associated with our owned and leased properties and real estate development projects.\nWe own or lease the real properties on which most of our restaurants are located and lease or sublease to the franchisee a majority of our franchised\nrestaurant sites. If we close a restaurant in a leased location, we may remain committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which would\ninclude, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Additionally, the potential losses associated with our inability to cancel\nleases may result in our keeping open restaurant locations that are performing significantly below targeted levels. As a result, ongoing lease obligations at\nclosed or underperforming restaurant locations could unfavorably impact our results of operations. In addition, at the end of the lease term and expiration of all\nrenewal periods, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. As a result, we may be required to close or relocate a\nrestaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nWe have a limited number of suppliers for our major products and rely on a distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners for the\nmajority of our national distribution program. If our suppliers or distributors are unable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts, it could harm our\noperations.\nWe contract with a distribution network with a limited number of distribution partners located throughout the nation to provide the majority of our food\ndistribution services. Through these arrangements, our food supplies are largely distributed through several primary distributors. If any of these relationships\nare interrupted or terminated, or if one or more supply or distribution partners are unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations for whatever reasons, product\navailability to our restaurants may be interrupted, and business and financial results may be negatively impacted. Although we believe that alternative supply\nand distribution sources are available, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or negotiate with such sources on terms that are commercially\nreasonable to us.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Risks\nIncreasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.\nOur regulatory environment exposes us to complex compliance and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. In many of\nour markets, we are subject to increasing regulation, which has increased our cost of doing business. We are affected by the cost, compliance and other risks\nassociated with the often conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations, including where inconsistent standards imposed by multiple governmental authorities\ncan adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\n14\nOur success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of new, potential or changing regulations that can affect our business plans and operations.\nThese include regulations affecting product packaging, marketing, the nutritional content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other\ndisclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by the need to comply with different, potentially conflicting laws in different\njurisdictions, and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers (particularly given varying requirements and\npractices for testing and disclosure).\nRegulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and\nregulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. These new laws or regulations could negatively impact our financial\nresults or affect restaurant operations.\nGovernmental regulation, including in one or more of the following areas, may adversely affect our existing and future operations and results, including\nby harming our ability to profitably operate our restaurants.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws\nWe are subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context\nof employment, public accommodations, and other areas. The expenses associated with any modifications we may be required to undertake with respect to our\nrestaurants or services, or any damages, legal fees, and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act or similar\nstate laws, could be material.\nConsumer Protection and Privacy Laws\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations concerning consumer protection and privacy as it relates to our marketing,\nadvertising, and promotional programs, including, but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Any\ndamages, legal fees, or costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under any such law could be material.\nFood Regulation\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration new authority regarding the safety of the entire food system, including\nthrough increased inspections and mandatory food recalls. Although restaurants are not directly implicated by these requirements, our suppliers may initiate or\notherwise be subject to food recalls or other consequences impacting the availability of certain products, which could result in adverse publicity, or require us\nto take actions that could be costly for us or otherwise impact our business and financial results.\nLocal Licensure, Zoning, and Other Regulation\nEach of our restaurants is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, food, and workplace safety and other agencies. We may\nexperience material difficulties, delays, or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant\nopenings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, land use, and environmental factors could delay or prevent\ndevelopment of new restaurants in particular locations.\nEnvironmental Laws\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release, and disposal of\nhazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances restricting the types of packaging we can use in our restaurants. If and to the extent any hazardous or\ntoxic substances are present on or adjacent to any of our restaurant locations, we believe any such contamination would be the responsibility of one or more\nthird parties and would have been or should be addressed by the responsible party. If the relevant third parties have not or do not address the identified\ncontamination properly or completely, then under certain environmental laws, we could be held liable as an owner or operator to address any remaining\ncontamination, sometimes without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. Any such\nliability could be material. Further, we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties, and any such liabilities could have\na material adverse effect on our financial results. We also cannot predict what environmental laws or laws regarding packaging will be enacted in the future,\nhow existing or future environmental or packaging laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to\ncomply with, or to satisfy claims relating to, such laws.\n15\nEmployment and Immigration Laws\nWe and our franchisees are subject to the federal labor laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, as well as various state and local laws governing such\nmatters as minimum wages, exempt status classification, overtime, breaks, schedules, and other working conditions for employees. Federal, state, and local\nlaws may also require us to provide paid and unpaid leave, healthcare, or other benefits to our employees. Changes in the law, or penalties associated with any\nfailure on our part to comply with legal requirements, could increase our labor costs or result in significant additional expense to us and our franchisees.\nStates in which we operate may adopt new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the U.S. Congress and the Department of Homeland Security\nfrom time to time consider and may implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations, or enforcement programs. Such changes and enforcement\nprograms may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more\ncumbersome. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our\nemployees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. All of our Company employees currently participate in the “E-Verify” program, an Internet-\nbased, free program run by the United States government to verify employment eligibility. However, use of the “E-Verify” program does not guarantee that we\nwill successfully identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or\npenalties, and if any of our employees or our franchisees’ employees are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that negatively\nimpacts our brands and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees who are found to\nbe unauthorized workers may disrupt operations, cause temporary increases in labor costs to train new employees, and result in additional adverse publicity. We\ncould also become subject to fines, penalties, and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all record keeping obligations of federal and\nstate immigration compliance laws. These factors could materially adversely affect our financial results.\nFranchising Activities\nOur franchising activities in the United States are subject to federal regulations administered by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, laws enacted by a\nnumber of states, and rules and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In particular, we are subject to federal and state laws\nregulating the offer and sale of franchises, as well as judicial and administrative interpretations of such laws. Such laws impose registration and disclosure\nrequirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may also apply substantive standards to the relationship between franchisor and franchisee,\nincluding limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchises and alter franchise arrangements. We also have franchising activities in Mexico, which\nare subject to regulations in that jurisdiction. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws, rules, and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain\nrequired government approvals could negatively affect our ability to grow or expand our franchise business and sell franchises.\nThe proliferation of federal, state, and local regulations increases our compliance risks, which in turn could adversely affect our business.\nThe restaurant and retail industries are subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including regulations relating to:\n• the preparation, ingredients, labeling, packaging, advertising, and sale of food and beverages;\n• building and zoning requirements;\n• sanitation and safety standards;\n• employee healthcare, including the implementation and legal, regulatory, and cost implications of the Affordable Care Act;\n• labor and employment, including minimum wage adjustments, overtime, working conditions, employment eligibility and documentation, sick leave,\nand other employee benefit and fringe benefit requirements, and changing judicial, administrative, or regulatory interpretations of federal or state labor\nlaws;\n• the registration, offer, sale, termination, and renewal of franchises;\n• Americans with Disabilities Act;\n• payment cards;\n• climate change, including regulations related to the potential impact of greenhouse gases, water consumption, or taxes on carbon emissions; and\n• consumer protection and privacy obligations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and other new\nor proposed federal and state regulations.\n16\nThe increasing amount and complexity of regulations and their interpretation may increase the costs to us and our franchisees of labor and compliance and\nincrease our exposure to legal and regulatory claims which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we strive to comply with all\napplicable existing rules and regulations, we cannot predict the effect on our operations from modifications to the language or interpretations of existing\nrequirements, or to the issuance of new or additional requirements in the future.\nLegislation and regulations regarding our products and ingredients, including the nutritional content of our products, could impact customer preferences\nand negatively impact our financial results.\nChanges in government regulation and consumer eating habits may impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings or require us to\ndisclose the nutritional content of our menu offerings. For example, a number of states, counties, and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-\nunit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to customers or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in\nrestaurants. Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act requires chain restaurants to publish calorie information on their menus and menu boards. These and other\nrequirements may increase our expenses, slow customers’ ordering process, or negatively influence the demand for our offerings; all of which can impact sales\nand profitability.\nCompliance with current and future laws and regulations in a number of areas, including with respect to ingredients, nutritional content of our products,\nand packaging and service ware may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if consumer health regulations change significantly, we may be required to\nmodify our menu offerings or packaging, and as a result, may experience higher costs or reduced demand associated with such changes. Some government\nauthorities are increasing regulations regarding trans-fats and sodium. While we have removed all artificial or “added during manufacturing” trans fats from\nour ingredients, some ingredients have naturally occurring trans-fats. Future requirements limiting trans-fats or sodium content may require us to change our\nmenu offerings or switch to higher cost ingredients. These actions may hinder our ability to operate in some markets or to offer our full menu in these markets,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, our business could also experience a material\nadverse effect.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business strategy depends, in part, on our ability to further build brand recognition using our trademarks, service\nmarks, trade dress, and other proprietary intellectual property, including our name and logos, our strategy, and the ambiance of our restaurants. If our efforts to\nprotect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes our intellectual property, either in print or on the Internet or a\nsocial media platform, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from\nachieving or maintaining market acceptance.\nWe franchise our brands to various franchisees. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all franchisees, we cannot assure that\nall franchisees will uphold brand standards so as not to harm the value of our intellectual property or our reputation.\nWe are subject to increasing legal complexity and may be subject to claims or lawsuits that are costly to defend and could result in our payment of\nsubstantial damages or settlement costs.\nWe are subject to complaints or litigation brought by current or former employees, customers, current or former franchisees, vendors, landlords,\nshareholders, competitors (e.g., intellectual property related claims), government agencies, or others. A judgment that is not covered by insurance or that is\nsignificantly in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, regardless of whether any\nclaims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend, and may divert management’s attention away from our\noperations and hurt our performance. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims against us or our franchisees may harm our business or that of our\nfranchisees.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result,\nthe Company’s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which could harm our business and the value of the Company’s common\nshares.\n17\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in maintaining\nadequate internal controls over our financial reporting and financial processes in the future. We may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that\nneed improvement. Furthermore, to the extent our business grows or significantly changes, our internal controls may become more complex, and we would\nrequire significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. If we or our independent auditors discover a material weakness, the\ndisclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market value of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material\nweakness may require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses and management may\nnot be able to remediate any such material weaknesses in a timely manner.\nChanges in tax laws, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities could adversely affect our income tax expense and\nincome tax payments.\nWe are subject to income taxation at the federal, state, and local levels in the U.S. Any significant changes in income tax laws, including, but not limited to,\nincome tax rate increases, authoritative interpretations of the tax laws, and/or comprehensive tax reform measures could adversely affect our financial condition\nor results of operations.\nWe may be subject to risk associated with disagreements with key stakeholders, such as franchisees.\nIn addition to shareholders, we have several key stakeholders, including our independent franchise operators. Third parties such as franchisees are not\nsubject to the control of the Company and may take actions or behave in ways that are adverse to the Company. Because the ultimate interests of franchisees\nand the Company are largely aligned around maximizing restaurant profits, the Company does not believe that any areas of disagreement between the\nCompany and its franchisees are likely to create material risk to the Company or its shareholders. Nevertheless, it is possible that conflict and disagreements\nwith these or other critical stakeholders could distract management or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals by stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-\nconsuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees. For example, we may be required to retain the services of\nvarious professionals to advise us on activist stockholder matters, including legal, financial, and communications advisers, the costs of which may negatively\nimpact our future financial results. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership created as a consequence of activist\nstockholder initiatives may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, customers, employees, and joint\nventure partners, and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation.\nRisks Related to Information and Technology\nWe are subject to the risk of cybersecurity breaches, intrusions, data loss, or other data security incidents.\nWe and our franchisees rely on computer systems and information technology to conduct our business. We have instituted controls, including information\nsecurity governance controls that are intended to protect our computer systems, our point of sale (“POS”) systems, and our information technology systems and\nnetworks; and adhere to payment card industry data security standards and limit third party access for vendors that require access to our restaurant networks.\nWe also have business continuity plans that attempt to anticipate and mitigate failures. However, we cannot control or prevent every cybersecurity risk.\nA material failure or interruption of service, or a breach in the security of our computer systems caused by malware, ransomware or other attack, could\ncause reduced efficiency in operations, or other business interruptions; could negatively impact delivery of food to restaurants, or financial functions such as\nvendor payment, employee payroll and scheduling, franchise operations reporting, or our ability to receive customer payments through our POS or other\nsystems, or could result in the loss or misappropriation of customer or employee data. Such events could negatively impact cash flows or require significant\ncapital investment to rectify; result in damage to our business or reputation or loss of consumer or employee confidence; and lead to potential costs, fines, and\nlitigation. Damage to our business or reputation or loss of consumer confidence may also result from any failure by our franchisees to implement standard\ncomputer systems and information technology, as we are dependent on our franchisees to adopt appropriate safeguards. These risks may be magnified by\nincreased and changing regulations. The costs of compliance and risk mitigation planning, including increased investment in technology or personnel in order\nto protect valuable business or consumer information, have increased significantly in recent years, and may also negatively impact our financial results.\n18\nRestaurants and other retailers have faced, and we could in the future become subject to, claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the\nactual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information or the loss of personally identifiable information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other\nproceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to\nincur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brands could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further\nadversely affect our financial results.\nWe collect and maintain personal information about our employees and our guests and are seeking to provide our guests with new digital experiences.\nThese digital experiences will require us to open up access into our POS systems to allow for capabilities like mobile order and pay, third party delivery, and\ndigital menu boards. The collection and use of personal information are regulated at the federal and state levels; such regulations include the California\nConsumer Privacy Act. We increasingly rely on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer,\nemployee, and franchisee information on our behalf. There has been an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to\ncompromise the security of these types of systems. If the security and information systems that we or our outsourced third-party providers use to store or\nprocess such information are compromised or if we, or such third parties, otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could face\nlitigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be\nadversely affected by these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies to maintain and grow sales, and we\ncannot predict the impact that these digital commerce platforms and technologies, other new or improved technologies or alternative methods of delivery\nmay have on consumer behavior and our financial results.\nAdvances in technologies, including advances in digital food order and delivery technologies, and changes in consumer behavior driven by such advances\ncould have a negative effect on our business. Technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new and enhanced technologies and\nconsumer offerings will be available in the future, including those with a focus on restaurant modernization, restaurant technology and digital engagement and\nordering. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable guest proposition and can be successfully\nintegrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance or our success in implementing these digital platforms, delivery channels\nor systems or other technologies or their impact on our business.\nWe are dependent on information technology and digital service providers and any material failure, misuse or interruption of our computer systems,\nsupporting infrastructure, consumer-facing digital capabilities or social media platforms could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent upon information technology and digital service providers to properly conduct our business, including point-of-sale processing in our\nrestaurants, order processing through digital channels, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes\nand procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business, service our customers and process digital orders through our mobile application and third-party\ndelivery partnerships depends significantly on the reliability and performance of our systems and those managed by our service providers. The failure of these\nsystems and processes to operate effectively, including an interruption or degradation in such systems or services, or if such systems or services become\noutdated, could be harmful and cause delays in customer service, loss of digital sales, reduce efficiency or cause delays in operations. Significant capital\ninvestments may be required to remediate any such problems. Additionally, the success of certain of our strategic initiatives, including to expand our consumer-\nfacing digital capabilities to connect with customers and drive growth, is highly dependent on our technology systems and digital service providers.\n19\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nThe securitized debt instruments issued by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms, and any failure to comply with such terms could\nresult in default, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.\nThe Series 2019-1 and Series 2022-1 Senior Notes (“Senior Notes”) are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this\ntype, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Senior Notes, (ii)\nprovisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case\nof the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for\nthe Senior Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to record keeping, access to information and similar matters. The Senior\nNotes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service\ncoverage ratios, the sum of gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events,\nan event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Senior Notes are also subject to\ncertain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the\nSenior Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties,\nfailure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.\nIn the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the Indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the Indenture or the\nfailure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term) which would require repayment of the Senior Notes, the funds available to us would be\nreduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate and/or grow our business. If our subsidiaries are not able to generate sufficient cash\nflow to service their debt obligations, they may need to refinance or restructure debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional\ncapital. If our subsidiaries are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, they may not be able to meet debt payment and other obligations which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe have a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our Company or its subsidiaries,\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to meet debt payment\nobligations.\nUnder the Indenture, the Master Issuer has approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding debt as of September 29, 2024.\nThis level of debt could have certain material adverse effects on the Company, including but not limited to:\n• our available cash flow in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes could be\nimpaired, and our ability to obtain additional financing for such purposes is limited;\n• a substantial portion of our cash flows could be required for debt service and, as a result, might not be available for our operations or other purposes;\n• any substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or any substantial increase in expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service\nrequirements or could force us to modify our operations or sell assets;\n• our ability to operate our business and our ability to repurchase stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders may be restricted by the financial and\nother covenants set forth in the Indenture.\n• our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be decreased; and\n• our level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business,\nregulatory, and economic conditions.\nIn addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current consolidated debt levels, the related\nrisks that it now faces could intensify.\nThe securitization transaction documents impose certain restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, and the failure to comply with\nsuch restrictions could adversely affect our business.\nThe Indenture and the management agreement entered into between certain of our subsidiaries and the Indenture trustee (the “Management Agreement”)\ncontain various covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in specified types of transactions. For example, the Indenture and the\nManagement Agreement contain covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of certain subsidiaries to:\n• incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n• sell certain assets;\n• alter the business conducted by our subsidiaries;\n• create or incur liens on certain assets; or\n20\n• consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the assets held within the securitization entities.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we may not have adequate resources or the flexibility to continue to manage the business and provide for growth of the\nJack in the Box system, including product development and marketing for the Jack in the Box brand, which could adversely affect our future growth prospects,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nThe Company maintains a comprehensive information security program that is designed to identify, protect against, detect, and respond to, and manage\ncybersecurity threats. The program contains security measures that include, but are not limited to, the following: security policies and procedures; physical and\nenvironmental protections; monitoring processes and systems; asset management; risk assessments; a vulnerability management and remediation program; and\nmaintenance of a third-party risk management program.\nOur Information Security Policy provides guidance on the requirements necessary to ensure the security of the Company’s data, systems, and networks. It\napplies to all individuals who access IT resources or data processed by the Company. We use commercially reasonable efforts to follow industry standards and\nbest practices, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework, for our IT Security Incident Response Plan.\nOur technology structures undergo an annual internal assessment to evaluate risk using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework; our assessment methodology\nand a thorough sampling of our results are validated annually by a third party. Our IT Security Incident Response Plan defines a cybersecurity incident and\noutlines the roles, responsibilities, and procedures for us to respond effectively. Having a structured plan enables a rapid response, effective recovery, clear\ncommunication and coordinated action to major security incidents. Our plan allows us to reduce recovery time and cost and to also maintain business\ncontinuity.\nOur IT Application Security Program includes reviews and assessments of security vulnerabilities and remediation. We use commercially reasonable\nefforts to update security systems regularly to protect against known vulnerabilities. We plan to perform vulnerability scans at least quarterly and penetration\ntesting annually as well as after any significant infrastructure or application modification. Whitebox and blackbox security testing and manual penetration\ntesting is performed to monitor security controls and defenses.\nAll employees and third-party contractors with access to the Company’s IT infrastructure must annually acknowledge that they have read and understand\nthe IT User Acceptance Policy. Employees and contractors must also complete information security awareness training upon initial hire and annually thereafter.\nWe have measures in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of franchise and customer information. Most personally identifiable\ninformation (“PII”) handled by our restaurants is associated with payment cards, which are protected by an EMV chip reader that encrypts and tokenizes\ncustomer data, so it passes through our networks without retaining any personal information. We do not store any credit or debit card information from\ncustomers. All information is processed through a third-party firm. To maintain the safety and security of our customers’ private payment information, we\nfollow the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) to ensure our processes and systems are well equipped for proper data protection.\nEmployees and third-party contractors with access to the Company’s cardholder data environment (“CDE”) or systems used to support the CDE, complete\nannual PCI awareness training. The Company’s corporate restaurant employees also receive periodic security training on devices that capture payment card\ndata.\nIn addition, the Company engages third parties to assist in assessing, identifying, and remediating material risks from cybersecurity threats. Our key\ncybersecurity controls applied to financial business processes and supporting information systems are regularly tested and audited by third-party service\nproviders, which we retain to help identify vulnerabilities in our systems and to help maintain compliance to standards and regulatory requirements.\n21\nCybersecurity Governance\nOur Board of Directors has charged the Audit Committee with oversight of the Company's identification, assessment, and management of cybersecurity\nand data privacy risks. As part of its oversight of our enterprise risk management program, the Audit Committee periodically reviews and prioritizes key risks\nfacing our Company, including cybersecurity risk. Our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) manage our\nnetwork operations and software development across corporate and franchise locations. The Board of Directors receives regular updates from the CISO and\nCTO regarding our cybersecurity program and actions taken to manage cybersecurity risk, which include risk identification and management strategies,\nconsumer data protection, security programs, ongoing risk mitigation activities and results of third-party assessments and testing.\nITEM 2.

RESERVED.\n27\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the fiscal year, we believe our Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes included in this annual report as indexed on page F-1.\nComparisons under this heading refer to the 52-week periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively. Our MD&A consists of the\nfollowing sections:\n• Overview — a general description of our business.\n• Results of Operations — an analysis of our consolidated statements of earnings for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.\n• Liquidity and Capital Resources — an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, share repurchase activity, dividends, and known\ntrends that may impact liquidity.\n• Critical Accounting Estimates — a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n• New accounting pronouncements — a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation and the impact on our consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations, if any.\n• Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements — a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ\nmaterially from any forward-looking statements made by management.\nWe have included in our MD&A certain performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance and which we believe will be useful\nin analyzing and understanding our results of operations. These metrics include:\n• Changes in sales at restaurants open more than one year (“same-store sales”), system restaurant sales, franchised restaurant sales, and average unit\nvolumes (“AUVs”). Same-store sales, restaurant sales, and AUVs are presented for franchised restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at franchise\nrestaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues and percentage rent\nrevenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. We believe franchise and system same-store sales, franchised and system-wide sales,\nand AUV information are useful to investors as they have a direct effect on the Company’s profitability.\nSame-store sales, system restaurant sales, franchised restaurant sales and AUVs are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and should\nnot be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to earnings from operations, or other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nA comparison of our results of operations and cash flows for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 can be found under Part II, “Item 7. Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nFounded in 1951, Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”) operates and franchises Jack in the Box® quick-service restaurants. As of September 29, 2024, we\noperated and franchised 2,191 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western and southern United States, including two in Mexico and two\nin Guam.\nOn March 8, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (“Del Taco”). Founded in 1964, Del Taco offers a unique variety of both\nMexican and American favorites such as burritos and fries. Del Taco is the nation’s second largest Mexican quick service restaurant chain by number of\nrestaurants and as of September 29, 2024 has 594 restaurants across 17 states.\nWe derive revenue from retail sales at company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties (based upon a percent of sales), franchise fees and\ncontributions for advertising and other services from franchisees.\nRefranchising of Del Taco\nIn fiscal year 2024, we continued on our refranchising strategy with three main intentions. First, to create a company-wide asset-light model that will\nbenefit from mitigating exposure to macroeconomic pressures; second, to generate incremental development agreements throughout the refranchising process\nthat provide a more robust unit growth pipeline than otherwise achievable; and third, to provide a more efficient capital structure. Our objective is to be asset-\nlight as we navigate market forces. We refranchised 47 Del Taco restaurants in fiscal year 2024, and added 42 new development commitments as a result of the\nrefranchising effort.\n28\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2024 AND 2023\nThe following tables summarize changes in same-store sales for Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated, franchised, and system restaurants:\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023\nCompany 0.0 % 8.8 %\nFranchise (1.5)% 7.1 %\nSystem (1.3)% 7.3 %\nDel Taco: 2024 2023\nCompany (1.3)% 2.0 %\nFranchise (1.6)% 1.4 %\nSystem (1.5)% 1.7 %\nThe following tables summarize changes in the number and mix of company and franchise restaurants for our two brands:\n2024 2023\nJack in the Box: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 142 2,044 2,186 146 2,035 2,181\nNew (1) 8 22 30 2 18 20\nRefranchised — — — (5) 5 —\nClosed — (25) (25) (1) (14) (15)\nEnd of year 150 2,041 2,191 142 2,044 2,186\n% of system 7 % 93 % 100 % 6 % 94 % 100 %\n2024 2023\nDel Taco: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 171 421 592 290 301 591\nNew 3 11 14 — 14 14\nAcquired from franchisees 10 (10) — — — —\nRefranchised (47) 47 — (111) 111 —\nClosed (4) (8) (12) (8) (5) (13)\nEnd of year 133 461 594 171 421 592\n% of system 22 % 78 % 100 % 29 % 71 % 100 %\n________________________\n(1) The restaurant count includes 6 cloud kitchens as of the end of fiscal year 2024.\nThe following tables summarize restaurant sales for company-operated, franchised, and systemwide sales for our two brands (in thousands):\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 427,057 $ 413,748\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 3,969,200 4,005,985\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 4,396,257 $ 4,419,733\nDel Taco: 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 281,978 $ 432,530\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 674,804 541,913\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 956,782 $ 974,443\n________________________\n(1) Franchised restaurant sales represent sales at franchised restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. Systemwide sales include company and franchised restaurant sales. We do not record\nfranchised sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues, marketing fees and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchised sales. We believe franchised and\nsystemwide sales information is useful to investors as they have a direct effect on the Company's profitability.\n29\nJack in the Box Brand\nCompany Restaurant Operations\nThe following table presents company restaurant sales and costs as a percentage of the related sales (dollars in thousands):\n2024 2023\nCompany restaurant sales $ 427,057 $ 413,748\nCompany restaurant costs:\nFood and packaging $ 126,063 29.5 % $ 130,904 31.6 %\nPayroll and employee benefits $ 134,678 31.5 % $ 127,357 30.8 %\nOccupancy and other $ 73,735 17.3 % $ 69,215 16.7 %\nCompany restaurant sales increased $13.3 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 as compared with the prior year due to an increase in the average number of\nrestaurants, as well as an increase in average check.

The greatest impacts were seen in produce, beef, and poultry.\nPayroll and employee benefit costs, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased to 31.5% in 2024 compared with 30.8% a year ago primarily\ndue to a 0.7% impact from wage inflation of approximately 6.9%, and an increase in group insurance, which were partially offset by a decrease in incentive\ncompensation. New regulations, such as AB 1228, which went into effect April 2024, have raised labor costs, particularly given our high concentration of\nrestaurants in California.\nOccupancy and other costs, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased to 17.3% in 2024 from 16.7% a year ago primarily due to higher\nsecurity costs, credit card fees and other operating costs, partially offset by lower maintenance and repair. costs.\n30\nJack in the Box Franchise Operations\nThe following table presents franchise revenues and costs in each fiscal year and other information we believe is useful in analyzing the change in\nfranchise operating results (dollars in thousands):\n2024 2023\nFranchise rental revenues $ 347,227 $ 351,283\nRoyalties 198,377 207,064\nFranchise fees and other 7,002 7,226\nFranchise royalties and other 205,379 214,290\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services 217,757 215,990\nTotal franchise revenues $ 770,363 $ 781,563\nFranchise occupancy expenses $ 217,430 $ 216,452\nFranchise support and other costs 12,731 10,072\nFranchise advertising and other services expenses 225,465 227,868\nTotal franchise costs $ 455,626 $ 454,392\nFranchise costs as a percentage of total franchise revenues 59.1 % 58.1 %\nAverage number of franchise restaurants 2,037 2,035\nFranchised restaurant sales $ 3,969,200 $ 4,005,985\nFranchise restaurant AUV $ 1,949 $ 1,968\nRoyalties as a percentage of total franchise restaurant sales (1) 5.0 % 5.2 %\n________________________\n(1) Excluding the impact of the $7.3 million termination fee in the first quarter of the prior year, royalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales would be 5.0% for the fiscal year ended\nOctober 1, 2023.\nFranchise rental revenues decreased $4.1 million, or 1.2%, in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in percentage rent of $8.5\nmillion, driven by lower sales, partially offset by increases in minimum rent of $3.3 million and an increase of $2.5 million related to franchise lease\nterminations.\nFranchise royalties and other decreased $8.9 million, or 4.2%, mainly in connection with a $7.3 million termination fee paid by a franchise operator who\nsold his restaurants to a new franchisee in the prior year, as well as lower royalty income driven by lower sales.\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services increased $1.8 million, or 0.8%, primarily due to increases in digital and technology fees of $3.5\nmillion, partially offset by lower marketing contributions of $2.0 million in connection with lower franchise same store sales of 1.5%.\nFranchise occupancy expenses, mainly rent, increased $1.0 million, or 0.5% in 2024, primarily due to higher operating lease costs.\nFranchise support and other costs increased $2.7 million, or 26.4% in 2024, mainly related to a $2.0 million increase in bad debt expense due to a rollover\nof a bad debt reversal in the prior year, as well as higher operating costs in connection with digital fees and brand standard audits.\nFranchise advertising and other service expenses decreased $2.4 million, or 1.1% in 2024 primarily due to lower marketing contributions resulting from a\ndecrease in franchise sales.\n31\nDel Taco Brand\nCompany Restaurant Operations\nThe following table presents company restaurant sales and costs as a percentage of the related sales (dollars in thousands):\n2024 2023\nCompany restaurant sales $ 281,978 $ 432,530\nCompany restaurant costs:\nFood and packaging $ 73,207 26.0 % $ 119,931 27.7 %\nPayroll and employee benefits $ 103,369 36.7 % $ 147,241 34.0 %\nOccupancy and other $ 65,569 23.3 % $ 94,057 21.7 %\nCompany restaurant sales decreased $150.6 million or 34.8%, in 2024 as compared with the prior year primarily due to the refranchising of 47 company-\noperated restaurants and the closing of 4 company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2024, as well as a decrease in same store sales compared to the prior year.\nThe following table presents the approximate impact of these items on company restaurant sales (in millions):\n2024 vs. 2023\nAUV decrease $ (6.1)\nDecrease in the average number of restaurants (144.1)\nOther (0.4)\nTotal change in company restaurant sales $ (150.6)\nSame-store sales at company-operated restaurants decreased 1.3% in 2024 compared to a year ago.

The largest sources of inflation in the current year were due to dairy and beverages, and was partially offset\nby favorability in pork, oil, eggs and cheese.\nPayroll and employee benefit costs, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased to 36.7% in 2024 compared with 34.0% a year ago primarily\ndue to a 2.2% impact from labor inflation. Labor inflation was 9.7% in the current year. Additional regulations, such as AB 1228, which went into effect April\n2024, have raised labor costs, particularly given our high concentration of restaurants in California.\nOccupancy and other costs, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased to 23.3% in 2024 from 21.7% a year ago primarily due to higher rent\nand operating expenses including utilities and information technology costs, partially offset by a change in the mix of restaurants due to refranchising.\n32\nDel Taco Franchise Operations\nThe following table presents franchise revenues and costs in each period and other information we believe is useful in analyzing the change in franchise\noperating results (dollars in thousands):\n2024 2023\nFranchise rental revenues $ 28,201 $ 13,308\nRoyalties 31,714 25,669\nFranchise fees and other 1,077 556\nFranchise royalties and other 32,791 26,225\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services 30,915 24,933\nTotal franchise revenues $ 91,907 $ 64,466\nFranchise occupancy expenses $ 27,948 $ 13,150\nFranchise support and other costs 4,551 2,259\nFranchise advertising and other services expenses 33,667 25,666\nTotal franchise costs $ 66,166 $ 41,075\nFranchise costs as a percentage of total franchise revenues 72.0 % 63.7 %\nAverage number of franchise restaurants 429 344\nFranchised restaurant sales $ 674,804 $ 541,913\nFranchised restaurant AUVs $ 1,573 $ 1,574\nRoyalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales 4.7 % 4.7 %\nFranchise rental revenues increased $14.9 million, or 111.9% in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher rental income of $11.0 million\nresulting from new subleases related to the 142 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023 and the 11 franchise-operated restaurants opened in\nfiscal 2024.\nFranchise royalties and other increased $6.6 million, or 25.0% in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher franchise restaurant sales\nresulting from the 142 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023 and the 11 franchise-operated restaurants opened in fiscal 2024.\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services revenues increased $6.0 million, or 24.0% in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to\nhigher marketing contributions related to higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 142 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023 and\nthe 11 franchise-operated restaurants opened in fiscal 2024.\nFranchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased $14.8 million, or 112.5% in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher rent related\nto franchise subleases for the 142 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023 and the 11 franchise-operated restaurants opened in fiscal 2024.\nFranchise support and other costs increased $2.3 million, or 101.5% in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher franchise development\nsupport costs, as well as additional overhead costs.\nFranchise advertising and other service expenses increased $8.0 million, or 31.2% in 2024 compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher franchise\nrestaurant sales resulting from the 142 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023 and the 11 franchise-operated restaurants opened in fiscal\n2024.\nCompany-Wide Results\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $2.5 million in 2024 as compared with the prior year. The decreases in depreciation are primarily due to the\nrefranchising of Del Taco restaurants since the prior year, as well as certain Jack in the Box franchise assets becoming fully depreciated. These decreases were\npartially offset by increases for new technology assets and new company restaurant openings.\n33\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses\nThe following table presents the amounts for SG&A expenses in each fiscal year (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nAdvertising $ 34,992 $ 38,753\nShare-based compensation 13,471 11,205\nIncentive compensation 9,911 20,283\nCash surrender value of COLI policies, net (14,390) (5,953)\nLitigation matters 1,811 7,001\nInsurance 3,183 5,991\nOther 94,255 95,592\n$ 143,233 $ 172,872\nAdvertising costs represent company contributions to our marketing funds and are generally determined as a percentage of company-operated restaurant\nsales. Advertising costs decreased $3.8 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in company-operated restaurant sales in the current year\nwhich was primarily driven by Del Taco refranchising.\nShare-based compensation in 2024 increased by $2.3 million compared to the prior year primarily due to a higher number of executive stock awards\noutstanding compared to the prior year.\nIncentive compensation in 2024 decreased by $10.4 million compared to the prior year primarily due to lower achievement levels compared to the prior\nyear for the Company’s annual incentive plan.\nThe cash surrender value of our Company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation\nsupported by these policies, are subject to market fluctuations. The changes in market values had a favorable impact of $8.4 million as compared to the prior\nyear.\nLitigation matters in 2024 decreased by $5.2 million as compared to the prior year due to the timing of litigation developments in each fiscal year. In fiscal\n2023, we recorded litigation charges of $8.3 million for Gessele vs. Jack in the Box Inc., partially offset by a $1.6 million reversal in connection with the J&D\nRestaurant Group legal matter based on the Court’s final ruling. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements for additional information.\nInsurance costs in 2024 decreased $2.8 million as compared to the prior year primarily due to positive development factors related to workers\ncompensation and general liability claims.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs associated with the opening of a new restaurant or the remodeling of an existing restaurant consist primarily of property rent and\nemployee training costs. Pre-opening costs associated with the opening of a restaurant that was closed upon acquisition consist of labor costs, maintenance and\nrepair costs, and property rent.\nGoodwill Impairment\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company identified triggering events that indicated the goodwill allocated to the Del Taco reporting unit might be\nimpaired. The triggering events related to i) a recent negative trend in Del Taco same store sales, ii) lower margins due in part to lower sales and wage increases\nrequired in California effective April 1, 2024 under AB 1228 and iii) unfavorable changes in the economic environment specifically impacting our industry,\nincluding inflation and interest rates. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative test over the Del Taco reporting unit, noting that the fair value of the\nreporting unit was less than the carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of goodwill of $162.6 million.\n34\nOther Operating Expense, Net\nOther operating expense, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nIntegration and strategic initiatives $ 15,631 $ 9,112\nCosts of closed restaurants and other 2,975 4,786\nRestaurant impairment charges 8,008 4,569\nAccelerated depreciation 699 541\nGains on acquisition of restaurants (2,702) —\nLosses (gains) on disposition of property and equipment, net 185 (8,171)\nOther operating expense, net $ 24,796 $ 10,837\nOther operating expense, net increased $14.0 million in 2024 versus the prior year primarily due to the decrease in gains on disposition of property and\nequipment of $8.4 million due to gains recognized in the prior year from a sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the\nproperties from us prior to the sale. The change was also impacted by the increase in integration and strategic initiatives of $6.5 million in the current year, as\nwell as an increase in restaurant impairment charges of $3.4 million relating to under-performing Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurants. Refer also to Note\n9, Other Operating Expense, Net, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nGains on the Sale of Company-Operated Restaurants\nIn 2024, gains on the sale of company-operated restaurants totaled $3.3 million and were related to the refranchising of 47 Del Taco restaurants. In the\nprior year, gains on the sale of company-operated restaurants totaled $18.0 million and were related to the refranchising of 111 Del Taco restaurants and five\nJack in the Box restaurants. Refer to Note 4, Summary of Refranchisings and Franchise Acquisitions, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for\nadditional information.\nOther Pension and Post-Retirement Expenses, Net\nOur policy is to fund our pension plans at or above the minimum required by law. As of the date of our last actuarial funding valuation, there was no\nminimum requirement. We do not anticipate making any contributions to our Qualified Plan in fiscal 2025. For additional information, refer to Note 12,\nRetirement Plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, is comprised of the following (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nInterest expense $ 82,134 $ 84,627\nInterest income (2,118) (2,181)\nInterest expense, net $ 80,016 $ 82,446\nInterest expense, net, decreased $2.4 million in 2024. The interest expense portion decreased by $2.5 million primarily due to lower average borrowings, as\nwell as lower average interest rates.\nIncome Taxes\nFor fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $32.4 million resulting in effective tax rate of negative 748.9%. The effective tax\nrate for such period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill partially offset by the reversal of state\ndeferred tax liabilities on basis difference of investments in subsidiaries and non-taxable gains from the market performance of insurance products used to fund\ncertain non-qualified retirement plans.\nFor fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $58.5 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 30.9%. The effective tax rate for\nsuch period differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of non-deductible goodwill related to the sale of company-operated restaurants\npartially offset by non-taxable gains from the market performance of insurance products used to fund certain non-qualified retirement plans.\n35\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit\nfacilities. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service\nrequirements, franchise tenant improvement allowance and incentive distributions, dividend payments, and obligations related to our benefit plans. We\ngenerally use available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common\nstock.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the Company had $54.2 million of cash and restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheet and available borrowings of\n$169.5 million under our $150.0 million Variable Funding Notes and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company continually assesses the optimal\nsources and uses of cash for our business. We review our balance sheet for any undervalued assets and pursue opportunities for capital sources, including the\nsale of our owned Jack in the Box properties and refranchising, primarily for Del Taco in the near term.\nBased upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing\nfacility and revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve\nmonths and the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 68,816 $ 215,006\nInvesting activities (69,371) 42,219\nFinancing activities (131,185) (207,358)\nNet cash flows $ (131,740) $ 49,867\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flows decreased $146.2 million compared with a year ago. This decrease is primarily due to an unfavorable change\nin working capital of $156.1 million, partially offset by higher net income, when adjusted for non-cash items, of $9.9 million. The change in working capital is\nprimarily a result of the payment of income taxes liabilities of $111.9 million (of which $50.3 million was a payment deferred from 2023 in connection with the\nSouthern California winter storm disaster area declaration), an increase in bonus payout, an increase in deferred rent accrual and an increase in the advertising\naccruals.\nPension and Postretirement Contributions — Our policy is to fund our pension plans at or above the minimum required by law. As of the date of our last\nactuarial funding valuation for our qualified pension plan, there was no minimum contribution funding requirement. In 2024 and 2023, we contributed $5.9\nmillion and $6.2 million, respectively, to our pension and postretirement plans. We do not anticipate making any contributions to our qualified defined benefit\npension plan in fiscal 2025. For additional information, refer to Note 12, Retirement Plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nInvesting Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased $111.6 million from 2024 compared to 2023. This increase was primarily due to\n$65.8 million of additional cash received in 2023 from the sale of Del Taco company-owned restaurants to franchisees, and an increase of $40.5 million for\namounts used for the purchase of property and equipment.\n36\nCapital Expenditures — The composition of capital expenditures in each fiscal year is summarized in the table below (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nRestaurants:\nRemodel / refresh programs $ 11,027 $ 9,159\nNew restaurants 22,563 8,159\nRestaurant facility expenditures 18,972 22,592\nPurchases of assets intended for sale and leaseback 26,455 14,960\nRestaurant information technology 28,019 13,037\n107,036 67,907\nCorporate Services:\nInformation technology 7,976 6,752\nCorporate facilities 462 295\n8,438 7,047\nTotal capital expenditures $ 115,474 $ 74,954\nIn 2024, capital expenditures increased by $40.5 million compared to a year ago, primarily due to an increase in information technology for both restaurant\nand corporate of $16.2 million, new restaurant openings of $14.4 million, and an increase in the purchases of Jack in the Box restaurant properties intended for\nsale and leaseback of $11.5 million.\nSale and Sale-leaseback Transactions — To optimize our balance sheet and capital structure, we use sales and leaseback financing and provide our\nfranchisees the opportunity to purchase the property that we currently lease to them.\nIn 2024, we completed one sales-leaseback transaction involving a restaurant property with proceeds of $1.7 million and completed the sale of properties\nto franchisees and other third parties during the year with proceeds of $25.0 million.\nFinancing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $76.2 million compared with a year ago, primarily as a result of a decrease in\nnet borrowings of $56.2 million and a $20.0 million decrease in share repurchases compared with a year ago.\nRepurchases of Common Stock — In fiscal 2024, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of $70.6 million,\nincluding applicable excise tax. As of September 29, 2024, there was $180.0 million remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of\nDirectors which do not expire.\nDividends — In fiscal 2024, the Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends of $0.44 per share, totaling $34.2 million. Future dividends are\nsubject to approval by our Board of Directors.\nSecuritized Refinancing Transaction — On February 11, 2022, the Company completed the sale of $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 3.445% Fixed Rate\nSenior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) and $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 4.136% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II\n(the “Class A-2-II” and, together with the Class A-2-I Notes, the “2022 Notes”). Interest payments on the 2022 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis. The\nanticipated repayment dates of the Class A-2-I Notes and the Class A-2-II Notes will be February 2027 and February 2032, respectively, unless earlier prepaid\nto the extent permitted.\nIn 2022, the Company also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes (the “Variable Funding\nNotes”), which permits borrowings up to a maximum of $150.0 million, subject to certain borrowing conditions, a portion of which may be used to issue letters\nof credit. As of September 29, 2024, we had $6.0 million of outstanding borrowings and had available borrowing capacity of $94.5 million under our 2022\nVariable Funding Notes, net of letters of credits issued of $49.5 million.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the 2022 Notes were used to repay in full $570.7 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company’s\nSeries 2019-1 Class A-2-I Notes, together with the applicable make-whole premium and unpaid interest, and was used to fund a portion of the Company’s\nacquisition of Del Taco Restaurants, Inc.\n37\nThe 2022 Notes were issued in a privately placed securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s revenue-generating assets,\nconsisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are\nheld by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as Guarantors of\nthe Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Notes. The\n2022 Notes are subject to the same covenants and restrictions as the Series 2019-1 Notes.\nThe quarterly principal payment on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding\nthe leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes.\nRestricted Cash — In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, certain cash accounts have been established with the Indenture trustee for the benefit of\nthe note holders and are restricted in their use. As of September 29, 2024, the Master Issuer had restricted cash of $29.4 million, which primarily represented\ncash collections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of interest and commitment fees required for the Class A-2 Notes and Variable\nFunding Notes.\nCovenants and Restrictions — The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the\nMaster Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and\nmandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under\ncertain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways\ndefective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid\namortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of gross sales for\nspecified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay\nor refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events\nrelating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain\ntime frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.\nAs of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenant requirements and were not subject to any rapid amortization events.\nContractual Obligations\nOur cash requirements greater than twelve months from contractual obligations and commitments include:\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments — Refer to Note 7, Indebtedness, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information of\nour obligations and the timing of expected payments.\nOperating and Finance Leases — Refer to Note 8, Leases, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information of our obligations\nand the timing of expected payments.\nPurchase Commitments — Purchase obligations includes non-cancelable purchase commitments related to information technology agreements and\nvolume commitments for beverage products. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected\nfuture payments.\nBenefit Obligations — Refer to Note 12, Retirement Plans, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our\nobligations and the timing of expected payments under our non-qualified defined benefit plan and postretirement healthcare plans.\nDISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s\nfinancial condition and results, and that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting\nestimates and policies are disclosed in Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n38\nLong-Lived Assets — We review our long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, for impairment whenever\nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped for recognition and measurement\nof impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test for long-lived\nassets requires us to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash\nflows expected to be generated through leases and/or subleases or by our individual company-operated restaurants. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset\ngroup exceeds the sum of related undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss by the amount that the carrying value of the assets exceeds\nfair value. Our estimates of cash flows used to assess impairment are subject to a high degree of judgment and may differ from actual cash flows due to, among\nother things, changes in our business plans, operating performance, and economic conditions.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment in the third quarter of each year,\nor more frequently, if indicators of impairment are present. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting units\nexceed their carrying values. Our reporting units are our two restaurant brands, Jack in the Box and Del Taco.\nOur impairment analyses first include a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the\nfair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Significant factors considered in this assessment include, but are not limited to, macro-economic\nconditions, market and industry conditions, cost considerations, the competitive environment, share price fluctuations, overall financial performance, and\nresults of past impairment tests. If the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we perform a\nquantitative impairment test.\nIn performing a quantitative test for impairment of goodwill, we primarily use the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash\nflow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Significant\nassumptions made by management to estimate fair value under the discounted cash flow method include future cash flow assumptions, which may differ from\nactual cash flows due to, among other things, economic conditions, or changes in operating performance. The discount rate is our estimate of the required rate\nof return that a third-party buyer would expect to receive when purchasing a business from us that constitutes a reporting unit. We believe the discount rate is\ncommensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the forecasted cash flows. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline\npublic company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied.\nIn the process of a quantitative test, if necessary, of the Del Taco trademark intangible asset, we primarily use the relief from royalty method under the\nincome approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief from royalty method include future trends in sales,\na royalty rate, an estimated income tax rate, and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\nSelf-Insurance — We are self-insured for a portion of our losses related to workers’ compensation, general liability and other legal claims, and health\nbenefits. In estimating our self-insurance accruals, we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses and assumptions related to the loss\ndevelopment factors, which are based on statistical analysis of historical data. These assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by\nchanging circumstances. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what was estimated, or should medical costs increase beyond what was\nexpected, accruals might not be sufficient, and additional expense may be recorded.\nLegal Accruals — The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business. A determination of the amount accrued, if any, for\nthese contingencies is made after analysis of each matter. We continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts as we deem\nappropriate. Because lawsuits are inherently unpredictable, and unfavorable resolutions could occur, assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires\njudgment about future events. As a result, the amount of ultimate loss may differ from those estimates.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk — We would be exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings under our $150.0 million Variable Funding Notes and our $75.0 million\nrevolving credit facility. As of September 29, 2024, we had $6.0 million of outstanding variable rate borrowings.\n39\nCommodity Price Risk —The Company is also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations. Many of the ingredients we use are\ncommodities or ingredients that are affected by the price of other commodities, weather, seasonality, production, availability, and various other factors outside\nour control. In order to minimize the impact of fluctuations in price and availability, we monitor the primary commodities we purchase and may enter into\npurchasing contracts and pricing arrangements when considered to be advantageous. However, certain commodities remain subject to price fluctuations. We are\nexposed to the impact of utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control. Our\nability to recover increased costs for commodities and utilities through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate.\nITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\na. Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended), as of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended September 29, 2024, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nb. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 29,\n2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nc. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal\ncontrol over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes\nthose policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that our transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems\ndetermined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nManagement, under the oversight of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and Audit Committee, assessed the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in 2013 by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management has concluded that,\nas of September 29, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective, at a reasonable assurance level, based on these criteria.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which follows.\n40\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nJack in the Box Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Jack in the Box Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our\nopinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income,\ncash flows and stockholders’ deficit for each of the fifty-two week periods ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, and the related\nnotes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated November 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nSan Diego, California\nNovember 20, 2024\n41\nITEM 9B.

In our\nopinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024 and\nOctober 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fifty-two week periods ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023 and\nOctober 2, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated November 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated\nfinancial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated\nor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements\nand (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of goodwill related to the Del Taco brand\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of September 29, 2024 was $25.4 million related to the\nDel Taco brand. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are\npresent. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of the Company’s reporting units exceed their carrying values. The\nCompany’s reporting units are their two restaurant brands, Jack in the Box and Del Taco.\nWe identified the evaluation of the goodwill impairment analysis for the Del Taco brand reporting unit as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the estimated\nfair value of the reporting unit involved a high degree of subjective auditor judgment. Specifically, the revenue growth rate assumptions used in\nestimating the fair value of the Del Taco brand reporting unit were challenging to evaluate as changes in these assumptions could have had a significant\neffect on the Company’s assessment of the impairment of the goodwill of that reporting unit.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating\neffectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s goodwill impairment assessment\nF-2\nprocess, which included a control related to the review of the revenue growth rate assumptions used in the projected financial information. We evaluated\nthe reasonableness of the revenue growth rate assumptions for the Del Taco brand reporting unit by comparing the revenue growth rate assumptions to\nindustry reports. We also compared the Company’s revenue growth rate assumptions to historical revenue growth rate trends to assess the Company’s\nability to accurately forecast. In addition, we performed sensitivity analyses over the Company’s revenue growth rate assumptions to assess the impact\nany changes to those assumptions could have had on the Company’s fair value estimate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\nSan Diego, California\nNovember 20, 2024\nF-3\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of operations — Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, develops, operates, and franchises quick-\nservice restaurants under the Jack in the Box® and Del Taco® restaurant brands.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company acquired Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (“Del Taco”) for cash according to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and\nPlan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 2021. Del Taco is a nationwide operator and franchisor of restaurants featuring fresh and fast Mexican and American\ninspired cuisines. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination, for further details.\nAs of September 29, 2024, there were 150 company-operated and 2,041 franchise-operated Jack in the Box restaurants and 133 company-operated and 461\nfranchise-operated Del Taco restaurants.\nReferences to the Company throughout these notes to the consolidated financial statements are made using the first-person notations of “we,” “us,” and\n“our.”\nBasis of presentation — The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nFiscal year — The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal\nyear ending the Tuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s\nfiscal 2024 results include two fewer days. Comparisons throughout these notes to the consolidated financial statements refer to the 52-week periods ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022 for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nPrinciples of consolidation — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Jack in the Box Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of estimates — In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make certain\nassumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosure of contingencies. In making these\nassumptions and estimates, management may from time to time seek advice and consider information provided by actuaries and other experts in a particular\narea. Actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates.\nRestricted cash — In accordance with the terms of our securitized financing facility, certain cash balances are required to be held in trust. Such restricted\ncash primarily represents cash collections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of quarterly interest and commitment fees required for\nthe Class A-2 Notes and Variable Funding Notes. As of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, restricted cash balances were $29.4 million and $28.3\nmillion, respectively.\nAccounts and other receivables, net — Our accounts and other receivables, net is primarily comprised of receivables from franchisees, tenants, credit card\nprocessors, and insurance receivables. Franchisee receivables primarily include rents, property taxes, royalties, marketing, sourcing and technology support\nfees associated with lease and franchise agreements, and notes from certain of our franchisees. Tenant receivables relate to subleased properties where we are\non the master lease agreement. We accrue interest on notes receivable based on the contractual terms.\nThe Company closely monitors the financial condition of our franchisees and estimates the allowance for credit losses based on the lifetime expected loss\non receivables. These estimates are based on historical collection experience with our franchisees as well as other factors, including current market conditions\nand events. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments compared to predefined aging criteria and known facts regarding the financial condition\nof the franchisee or customer. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased. The Company’s allowance for\ndoubtful accounts has not historically been material. The following table summarizes the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nBalance as of beginning of period $ (4,146) $ (5,975)\nReversal (provision) for expected credit losses, net (372) 1,788\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance 6 41\nBalance as of end of period $ (4,512) $ (4,146)\nF-9\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nInventories — Our inventories consist principally of food, packaging, and supplies, and are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out\nbasis.\nInternal-use Software Costs — The Company capitalizes costs incurred to implement software solely for its internal use, including (i) hosted applications\nused to deliver the Company's support services, and (ii) certain implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract when the\npreliminary project stage is complete, management with the relevant authority authorizes and commits to the funding of the software project, and it is probable\nthe project will be completed and used to perform the intended function. Software implementation costs are capitalized to either other current assets or other\nlong-term assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet and amortized over the estimated useful life of the developed software. Hosted software\nimplementation costs capitalized were $11.1 million and $7.9 million as of the end of fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively. Related amortization expense for\nsoftware implementation costs was $4.5 million, $5.0 million and $5.1 million during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAssets held for sale — Our assets held for sale typically includes property and restaurants we plan to sell within the next year, including amounts relating\nto i) company-owned restaurants to be refranchised, ii) operating restaurant properties which we intend to sell to franchisees and/or sell and leaseback with a\nthird party, and iii) closed restaurant properties which we are marketing for sale. If the determination is made that we no longer expect to sell an asset within\nthe next year, the asset is reclassified out of assets held for sale. Long-lived assets that meet the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of their carrying\nvalue or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.\nProperty and equipment, net — Expenditures for new facilities and equipment, and those that substantially increase the useful lives of the property, are\ncapitalized. Facilities leased under finance leases are stated at the present value of minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term, not to exceed\nfair value. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and\naccumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and gains or losses on the dispositions are included in “Other operating expense, net” in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of earnings.\nBuildings, equipment, and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the\nassets, over the initial lease term for certain assets acquired in conjunction with the lease commencement for leased properties, or the remaining lease term for\ncertain assets acquired after the commencement of the lease for leased properties. In certain situations, one or more option periods may be used in determining\nthe depreciable life of assets related to leased properties if we deem that an economic penalty would be incurred otherwise. In either circumstance, our policy\nrequires lease term consistency when calculating the depreciation period, in classifying the lease and in computing straight-line rent expense. Building,\nleasehold improvement assets and equipment are assigned lives that range from 1 to 35 years. Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was\n$59.2 million, $61.7 million, and $55.8 million in fiscal year 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nImpairment of long-lived assets — We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets are grouped for recognition and\nmeasurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test\nfor long-lived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated\nfuture cash flows directly associated with and arising from our use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group\nexceeds the sum of related undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss by the amount that the carrying value of the assets exceeds fair\nvalue. Refer to Note 9, Other Operating Expense, Net, for additional information.\nGoodwill and trademarks — Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, if any. We generally record\ngoodwill in connection with the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees or the acquisition of another business. Likewise, upon the sale of restaurants to\nfranchisees, goodwill is decremented. The amount of goodwill written-off is determined as the fair value of the business disposed of as a percentage of the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit retained. If the business disposed of was never fully integrated into the reporting unit after its acquisition, and thus the benefits of the\nacquired goodwill were never realized, the current carrying amount of the acquired goodwill is written off. Goodwill is not amortized and has been assigned to\nreporting units for purposes of impairment testing. Our two restaurant brands, Jack in the Box and Del Taco, are both operating segments and reporting units.\nF-10\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually during the third quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. We first\nassess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value\nof a reporting unit or indefinite-lived asset is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is\nless than the carrying amount, we perform a single-step impairment test. To perform our impairment analysis, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit\nand compare it to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess.\nWe evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate\nimpairments might exist. We perform our annual test for impairment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the third quarter. We may elect to perform a\nqualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying value.\nIf a qualitative assessment is not performed, or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived\nintangible asset exceeds its carrying value, then the asset's fair value is compared to its carrying value. Fair value is an estimate of the price a willing buyer\nwould pay for the intangible asset and is estimated by discounting the expected future after-tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we had performed quantitative tests over the Del Taco reporting unit noting that the fair value of the reporting unit was\nless than the carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of goodwill of $162.6 million. Refer also to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the notes\nto the consolidated financial statements for results of these tests and for additional information.\nIntangible assets, net — Intangible assets primarily include franchise contracts, reacquired franchise rights and sublease assets. Franchise contracts, which\nrepresent the fair value of franchise agreements based on the projected royalty revenue stream as of the acquisition date, are amortized on a straight-line basis\nto “Depreciation and amortization expense” in the consolidated statements of earnings over the remaining term of the franchise agreements. Reacquired\nfranchise rights are recorded in connection with our acquisition of franchised restaurants and are amortized on a straight-line basis to “Depreciation and\namortization expense” in the consolidated statements of earnings over the term of the former franchise agreement. Sublease assets, which represent subleases\nwith stated rent above comparable market rents, are amortized on a straight-line basis to “Franchise rental revenues” in the consolidated statements of earnings\nover the term of the related sublease.\nCompany-owned life insurance — We have purchased company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies to support our non-qualified benefit plans. The\ncash surrender values of these policies were $129.7 million and $113.2 million as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, and are included in\n“Other assets, net”, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in cash surrender values are included in “Selling, general and administrative\nexpenses” in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. These policies reside in an umbrella trust for use only to pay plan benefits to participants\nor to pay creditors if the Company becomes insolvent.\nLeases — We evaluate the contracts entered into by the Company to determine whether such contracts contain leases. A contract contains a lease if the\ncontract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, and equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. At commencement,\ncontracts containing a lease are further evaluated for classification as an operating or finance lease where the Company is a lessee, or as an operating, sales-\ntype, or direct financing lease where the Company is a lessor, based on their terms.\nThe lease term and incremental borrowing rate for each lease requires judgement by management and can impact the classification of our leases as well as\nthe value of our lease assets and liabilities. When determining the lease term, we consider option periods available, and include option periods in the\nmeasurement of the lease right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability where the exercise is reasonably certain to occur. As our leases do not provide an\nimplicit discount rate, we have determined it is appropriate to use our estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate, based on the yield curve for the\nrespective lease terms, in calculating our lease liabilities.\nRevenue recognition — “Company restaurant sales” include revenue recognized upon delivery of food and beverages to the customer at company-\noperated restaurants, which is when our obligation to perform is satisfied. Company restaurant sales exclude taxes collected from the Company’s customers.\nGift cards, upon customer purchase, are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in revenue as they are redeemed.\nThe Company operates loyalty programs in which members earn points primarily for food purchases. Points can then be redeemed for special reward\noffers. The Company allocates the consideration received on loyalty orders between the food purchased and the loyalty points earned, taking into consideration\nthe expected redemption rate of loyalty points. The consideration allocated to the food is recognized as revenue at the time of sale. The consideration allocated\nto the loyalty points earned is deferred until the loyalty points are redeemed or expire.\nF-11\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n“Franchise rental revenues” received from franchised restaurants based on fixed rental payments are recognized as revenue over the term of the lease.\nRental revenue from properties owned and leased by the Company and leased or subleased to franchisees is recognized on a straight-line basis over the\nrespective term of the lease. Certain franchise rents, which are contingent upon sales levels, are recognized in the period in which the contingency is met.\n“Franchise royalties and other” primarily includes royalties and franchise fees received from our franchisees. Royalties are based upon a percentage of\nsales of the franchised restaurant and are recognized as earned. Franchise royalties are billed on a monthly or weekly basis. Franchise fees when a new\nrestaurant opens or at the start of a new franchise term are recorded as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the term of the franchise\nagreement.\n“Franchise contributions for advertising and other services” includes franchisee contributions to our marketing funds billed on a monthly or weekly basis\nand sourcing and technology fees, as required under the franchise agreements. Contributions to our marketing funds are based on a percentage of sales and\nrecognized as earned. Sourcing and technology services are recognized when the goods or services are transferred to the franchisee.\nGift cards — We sell gift cards to our customers in our restaurants and through selected third parties. The gift cards sold to our customers have no stated\nexpiration dates and are subject to actual or potential escheatment rights in several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize income from gift\ncards when redeemed by the customer. Deferred gift card income totaled $2.7 million and $2.9 million as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023,\nrespectively, and are included in “Accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile we will continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card\nbalances due to, among other things, long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, to the extent we determine there is no requirement for remitting\nbalances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, card balances may be recognized as income in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAmounts recognized on unredeemed gift card balances were $0.8 million, $1.6 million, and $0.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nPre-opening costs — Pre-opening costs associated with the opening of a new restaurant or the remodeling of an existing restaurant consist primarily of\nproperty rent and employee training costs. Pre-opening costs associated with the opening of a restaurant that was closed upon acquisition consist of labor costs,\nmaintenance and repair costs, and property rent.\nSelf-insurance — We are self-insured for a portion of our workers’ compensation, general liability, employee medical and dental, and automotive claims.\nWe utilize a paid-loss plan for our workers’ compensation, general liability, and automotive programs, which have predetermined loss limits per occurrence and\nin the aggregate. We establish our undiscounted insurance liability and reserves using independent actuarial estimates of expected losses based on a statistical\nanalysis of historical claims data. As of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, our estimated self-insurance liability was $27.9 million and $31.3 million,\nrespectively, and is included in “Accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nAdvertising costs — We administer marketing funds at each of our restaurant brands that include contractual contributions. In 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nmarketing fund contributions from Jack in the Box franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 5.0% of sales. In 2024, 2023, and 2022,\nmarketing fund contributions from Del Taco franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 4.0% of sales.\nProduction costs of commercials, programming, and other marketing activities are charged to the marketing funds when the advertising is first used for its\nintended purpose, and the costs of advertising are charged to operations as incurred. When contributions to the marketing fund exceed the related advertising\nexpenses, advertising costs are accrued up to the amount of revenues on an annual basis since we are contractually obligated to spend these funds. When\nadvertising costs are greater than the contributions to the marketing fund resulting in a deficit, the excess costs are covered by marketing fund contributions in\nthe following year. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the Jack in the Box marketing fund ended the year with a surplus and the additional\namounts accrued were $0.8 million and $9.5 million, respectively. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the Del Taco marketing fund ended the year\nwith a $0.8 million deficit and a $0.8 million surplus, respectively. Total contributions made by the Company and marketing fund deficits, if any, are included\nin “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. In fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 consolidated\nadvertising costs were $35.0 million, $38.9 million, and $32.6 million, respectively.\nShare-based compensation — We account for our share-based compensation under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) authoritative\nguidance on stock compensation, which generally requires, among other things, that all employee share-based compensation be measured using a fair value\nmethod and that the resulting compensation cost be recognized in the financial statements. Compensation expense for our share-based compensation awards is\ngenerally recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the vesting period or the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes\neligible to retire. Refer to Note 13, Share-based Employee Compensation, for additional information.\nF-12\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nIncome taxes — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial\nstatement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be\nrecovered or settled. We recognize interest and, when applicable, penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our income tax provision.\nAuthoritative guidance issued by the FASB prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is\nrecognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority,\nincluding resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Refer to Note 11, Income Taxes, for additional\ninformation.\nContingencies — We recognize liabilities for contingencies when we have an exposure that indicates it is probable that an asset has been impaired or that a\nliability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated. Our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to such\nmatters cannot be estimated with certainty and requires the use of estimates. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate\nwithin the range. We record legal settlement costs when those costs are probable and reasonably estimable. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies,\nfor additional information.\nBusiness combinations — We account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nare recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired, including the amount\nassigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nEffect of accounting pronouncements adopted in 2024 and those to be adopted in future periods — We reviewed the accounting pronouncements\nadopted in 2024, as well as all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a\nsignificant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n2. REVENUE\nNature of products and services — We derive revenue from retail sales at Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated restaurants and rental revenue,\nroyalties, advertising, and franchise and other fees from franchise-operated restaurants.\nOur franchise arrangements generally provide for an initial franchise fee per restaurant for a 20-year term, and generally require that franchisees pay\nroyalty and marketing fees based upon a percentage of gross sales. The agreements also require franchisees to pay technology fees, as well as sourcing fees for\nJack in the Box franchise agreements.\nDisaggregation of revenue — The following table disaggregates revenue by segment and primary source for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024 (in\nthousands):\nJack in the Box Del Taco Total\nCompany restaurant sales $ 427,057 $ 281,978 $ 709,035\nFranchise rental revenues 347,227 28,201 375,428\nFranchise royalties 198,377 31,714 230,091\nMarketing fees 197,900 26,258 224,158\nTechnology and sourcing fees 19,857 4,658 24,515\nFranchise fees and other services 7,002 1,077 8,079\nTotal revenue $ 1,197,420 $ 373,886 $ 1,571,306\nF-13\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

The payment represented the difference between the existing\nroyalty rate and the new royalty rate based on projected future sales for the remaining term of the existing agreements. The payment was non-refundable and\nnot subject to any adjustments based on actual future sales. The Company determined the transaction represented the termination of the existing agreement\nrather than the transfer of an agreement between franchisees. As such, the $7.3 million was recognized in franchise royalty revenue during the first quarter of\n2023.\nContract liabilities — Our contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue resulting from initial fees received from franchisees for new restaurant openings\nor new franchise terms, which are generally recognized over the franchise term. We classify these contract liabilities within “Accrued liabilities” and “Other\nlong-term liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nA summary of significant changes in our contract liabilities is presented below (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nDeferred franchise and development fees at beginning of period $ 50,474 $ 46,449\nRevenue recognized during the period (5,854) (5,469)\nAdditions during the period 7,370 9,494\nDeferred franchise and development fees at end of period $ 51,990 $ 50,474\nAs of September 29, 2024, approximately $9.2 million of development fees related to unopened stores are included in deferred revenue.

BUSINESS COMBINATION\nOn March 8, 2022 (the “Closing Date”), the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest of Del Taco for cash according to the terms and\nconditions of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 5, 2021 (the “Merger Agreement”). The acquisition of Del Taco has been accounted for\nusing the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations, with the Company treated as the accounting acquirer, which\nrequires, among other things, that the assets acquired, and liabilities assumed be recognized at their acquisition date fair value. Jack in the Box acquired Del\nTaco as a part of the Company’s goal to gain greater scale and accelerate growth.\nIn connection with the transaction, the Company repaid Del Taco's existing debt of $115.2 million related to a syndicated credit facility and Del Taco\nentered into a new syndicated credit facility.\nThe total purchase consideration for Del Taco was $593.3 million. Each share of Del Taco common stock issued and outstanding was converted into the\nright to receive $12.51 in cash without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes (“Merger Consideration”). Additionally, in connection with the\ntransaction, each Del Taco equity award granted under Del Taco’s equity compensation plans was either (i) converted into the right to receive Merger\nConsideration or (ii) converted into equity awards with respect to Jack in the Box common stock. Other components of purchase consideration include cash\npaid to settle Del Taco’s existing debt and $7.1 million of seller transaction costs funded by Jack in the Box.\nAs part of the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company assumed Del Taco’s historical equity compensation plans. The awards under Del\nTaco’s historical equity compensation plans that were not subject to accelerated vesting were exchanged for replacement awards of the Company, which\nincluded Del Taco’s non-accelerating restricted stock awards (“non-accelerating RSAs”). Immediately following the Merger, these replacement awards were\nmodified to accelerate the remaining vesting period to be one year following the Closing Date, other than the awards already scheduled to vest on June 30,\n2022. The portion of the fair value of the replacement awards associated with pre-acquisition service of Del Taco’s employees represented a component of the\ntotal purchase consideration. The remaining fair value of these replacement awards are subject to the recipients’ continued service and thus were excluded from\nthe purchase price. The awards which are subject to continued service will be recognized ratably as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite\nservice period.\nThe acquisition of Del Taco was funded by cash on hand and borrowings under our 2022 Class A-2 Notes and 2022 Variable Funding Notes. The Company\nrecognized transaction costs of $12.3 million in fiscal 2022. These costs were associated with advisory, legal, and consulting services and are presented in\n“Other operating expense, net” in the consolidated statement of operations.\nF-15\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe excess of the total consideration over the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The goodwill of\n$319.7 million arising from the acquisition was primarily attributable to the market position and future growth potential of Del Taco for both company-operated\nand franchised restaurants related to future store openings, expansion into new markets, and expected synergies. None of the goodwill resulting from the\nacquisition is deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill arising from the Del Taco acquisition was allocated to the Company’s reporting units as follows (in\nthousands):\nDel Taco brand $ 230,722\nJack in the Box brand 89,000\nTotal acquisition date goodwill $ 319,722\nRefer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, for further details and for the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill.\nIdentifiable intangible assets — The identifiable intangible assets acquired consist of trademarks, franchise and development agreements, and favorable\nsubleases. The Company amortizes the fair value of the franchise and development agreements and favorable and unfavorable sublease assets and liabilities on\na straight-line basis over their respective useful lives.\nThe trademarks were valued using the relief from royalty method of the income approach, which was applied by discounting the after-tax royalties avoided\nby owning the trademark to present value. The key inputs and assumptions included the Company's estimates of the projected system wide sales, royalty rate\nand discount rate applicable to the trademark.\nThe franchise and development agreements were valued using the income approach, which was applied by discounting the projected after-tax cash flows\nassociated with the agreements to present value. The key inputs and assumptions included the Company's estimates of the projected royalties received under\nthe existing franchise and development agreements (including the impact of franchise churn) and the applicable discount rate.\nThe favorable and unfavorable sublease assets and liabilities were valued using the income approach, which was applied by discounting the differential\nbetween the market rent and contract rent to present value. The key inputs and assumptions included the Company's estimates of the market rent, contract rent\nand discount rate applicable to the favorable and unfavorable subleases.\nThe values allocated to intangible assets and the useful lives are as follows (in thousands):\nWeighted Average\nAmount Useful Life (Years)\nTrademarks $ 283,500 Indefinite\nFranchise contracts 9,700 18\nSublease assets 2,671 13\nEstimated fair value of acquired intangible assets $ 295,871\nThe estimated values of sublease liabilities totaled approximately $6.0 million.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information for all periods presented includes the business combination accounting effects resulting from this\nacquisition, mainly including adjustments to reflect additional amortization expense from acquired intangibles, incremental depreciation expense from the fair\nvalue property and equipment, elimination of historical interest expense associated with both Del Taco’s and the Company’s historical indebtedness, additional\ninterest expense associated with the new Del Taco revolving credit facility and the Company’s new borrowings as part of the refinancing to fund the\nacquisition, adjusted rent expense reflecting the acquired right-of-use assets and liabilities to their estimated acquisition-date values based upon valuation of\nrelated lease intangibles and remaining payments, as well as the fair value adjustments made to leasehold improvements, certain material non-recurring\nadjustments and the tax-related effects as though Del Taco was combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information as\npresented above is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition\nhad taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2021, nor is it necessarily an indication of trends in future results for a number of reasons, including, but not limited\nto, differences between the assumptions used to prepare the pro forma information, cost savings from operating efficiencies, potential synergies, and the impact\nof incremental costs incurred in integrating the two brands.\nFor the periods subsequent to the acquisition that are included in 2022, Del Taco had total revenues of $316.9 million and net earnings of $6.5 million.\n4. SUMMARY OF REFRANCHISINGS AND FRANCHISE ACQUISITIONS\nRefranchisings — The following table summarizes the number of restaurants sold to franchisees and gains recognized in each fiscal year (dollars in\nthousands):\n2024 2023 2022\nRestaurants sold to Jack in the Box franchisees — 5 15\nRestaurants sold to Del Taco franchisees 47 111 —\nProceeds from the sale of company-operated restaurants (1) $ 19,400 $ 85,221 $ 6,391\nBroker commissions — (1,614) —\nNet assets sold (primarily property and equipment) (5,310) (17,101) (1,565)\nGoodwill related to the sale of company-operated restaurants (6,835) (35,544) (948)\nFranchise fees (1,266) (3,086) —\nSublease liabilities, net (140) (8,559) —\nLease termination (225) (393) —\nOther (2) (2,369) (926) —\nGains on the sale of company-operated restaurants $ 3,255 $ 17,998 $ 3,878\n________________________\n(1) Amounts in 2024, 2023, and 2022 include additional proceeds of $1.5 million, $0.9 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, related to the extension of the underlying\nfranchise and lease agreements from the sale of restaurants in prior years.\n(2) Amount in 2024 is primarily comprised of a $2.2 million loss on sale of assets related to a Del Taco refranchising transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024.\nAmount in 2023 is primarily related to charges for a restaurant that was closed due to refranchising the related market.\nFranchise acquisitions — In 2024, Del Taco purchased 10 franchise-operated restaurants for $86 thousand as part of three separate transactions, and\nrecognized related gains of $2.7 million. In 2022, Jack in the Box acquired 13 franchise restaurants for total consideration of $0.3 million, comprised of\nfranchise receivables owed to the Company as of the acquisition date. There were no such acquisitions in 2023. We account for the acquisition of franchised\nrestaurants using the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during fiscal 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\nJack in the Box Del Taco Total\nGoodwill $ 136,099 $ 230,722 $ 366,821\nAccumulated impairment losses — — —\nBalance at October 2, 2022 136,099 230,722 366,821\nSale of Del Taco company-operated restaurants to franchisees — (35,472) (35,472)\nSale of Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants to franchisees (72) — (72)\nReclassified to assets held for sale — (1,291) (1,291)\nGoodwill 136,027 193,959 329,986\nAccumulated impairment losses — — —\nBalance at October 1, 2023 136,027 193,959 329,986\nImpairment of goodwill — (162,624) (162,624)\nSale of Del Taco company-operated restaurants to franchisees — (5,544) (5,544)\nReclassified to assets held for sale (200) (409) (609)\nGoodwill 135,827 188,006 323,833\nAccumulated impairment losses — (162,624) (162,624)\nBalance at September 29, 2024 $ 135,827 $ 25,382 $ 161,209\nAs of the June 9, 2024 testing date, the balance of the Del Taco reporting unit goodwill was $194.0 million. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company\nidentified triggering events that indicated the goodwill allocated to the Del Taco reporting unit might be impaired. The triggering events related to i) a recent\nnegative trend in Del Taco same store sales, ii) lower margins due in part to lower sales and wage increases required in California effective April 1, 2024 under\nAB 1228 and iii) unfavorable changes in the economic environment specifically impacting our industry, including inflation and interest rates. As a result, the\nCompany performed a quantitative test over the Del Taco reporting unit, noting that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value, which\nresulted in an impairment of goodwill of $162.6 million. The Company determined that there was no such triggering event for the Jack in the Box reporting\nunit during 2024.\nIn performing a quantitative test for impairment of goodwill for Del Taco, we primarily use the income approach method of valuation that includes the\ndiscounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of the reporting unit.\nSignificant assumptions made by management to estimate fair value under the discounted cash flow method include future cash flow assumptions. The\nCompany also performed a quantitative analysis over its indefinite-lived intangible trademark asset, as well as over its definite-lived intangible assets to\ndetermine whether any impairment would need to be recognized, noting none.\nIn connection with the goodwill impairment test, the Company also performed a quantitative analysis over its long-lived assets, noting impairment of\n$0.1 million, which was recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nF-20\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

The fair value of these loans approximates their\ncarrying value due to the variable rate nature of these borrowings.\nNon-financial assets and liabilities — Our non-financial instruments, which primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use\nassets, goodwill, and intangible assets, are reported at carrying value and are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, on an\nannual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable, non-financial instruments are assessed\nfor impairment. If applicable, the carrying values are written down to fair value.\nIn connection with our impairment reviews performed during 2024, the Company impaired certain assets.

As a result, the Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $5.6 million during the second quarter of 2022, which was\ncomprised of the write-off of certain deferred financing costs and a specified make-whole premium payment, and is presented in “Interest expense, net” in the\nconsolidated statement of operations. Additionally, in connection with the 2022 Notes, the Company capitalized $17.4 million of debt issuance costs, which are\nbeing amortized into interest expense over the Anticipated Repayment Dates, utilizing the effective interest rate method. The costs related to our Variable\nFunding Notes are presented within “Other assets, net” and are being amortized over the Anticipated Repayment Date of February 2027 using the straight-line\nmethod. As of September 29, 2024, the effective interest rates, including the amortization of debt issuance costs, were 4.851%, 5.258%, 3.796%, and 4.347%\nfor the Series 2019-1 Class A-2-II Notes, Series 2019-1 Class A-2-III Notes, Series 2022-1 Class A-2-I Notes, and Series 2022-1 Class A-2-II Notes,\nrespectively.\nF-22\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe 2022 Notes were issued in a privately placed securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s revenue-generating assets,\nconsisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are\nheld by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as Guarantors of\nthe Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Notes.\nThe quarterly principal payment on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding\nthe leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. Subsequent to closing the issuance of the 2022 Notes, the Company has\nhad a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, the Company is making the scheduled principal payments on its 2022 Notes and Series 2019-1\nNotes.\nVariable Funding Notes — Depending on the type of borrowing under the Variable Funding Notes, interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be based\non (i) the prime rate, (ii) overnight federal funds rates, (iii) the London interbank offered rate for U.S. Dollars or (iv) the lenders’ commercial paper funding\nrate plus any applicable margin, as set forth in the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement. There is a scaled commitment fee on the unused portion of the\nVariable Funding Notes facility of between 50 and 100 basis points. The principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes were repaid in full in October\n2024. Following the anticipated repayment date (and any extensions thereof), additional interest will accrue equal to 5.00% per annum.\nGuarantees and collateral — Pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated July 8, 2019 (the “Guarantee and Collateral Agreement”), among\nthe Guarantors, in favor of the trustee, the Guarantors guarantee the obligations of the Master Issuer under the Indenture and related documents and secure the\nguarantee by granting a security interest in substantially all of their assets. The Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the\nMaster Issuer and the Guarantors (collectively, the “Securitization Entities”). The assets of the Securitization Entities include most of the revenue-generating\nassets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise-related agreements, certain company-operated restaurants, intellectual\nproperty and license agreements for the use of intellectual property. Upon certain trigger events, mortgages will be required to be prepared and recorded on the\nreal estate assets.\nRevolving credit facility — In connection with the Del Taco acquisition, Del Taco’s existing debt of $115.2 million related to a Syndicated Credit Facility\ndated August 5, 2015, was repaid and extinguished on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Del Taco entered into a new syndicated credit facility with an\naggregate principal amount of up to $75.0 million, which now matures on February 28, 2025. The Company capitalized $0.3 million of debt issuance costs,\nwhich are being amortized into interest expense over the expected term of the credit facility. The revolving credit facility, as amended, included a limit of\n$20.0 million for letters of credit, all of which were cancelled as of September 29, 2024. As of September 29, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and\navailable borrowing capacity of $75.0 million under the facility.\nBridge commitment letter — In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company secured commitments for a bridge financing facility in an amount\nof up to $600.0 million (the “Bridge Facility”). No amounts were drawn under the Bridge Facility, which was terminated as a result of our securitization\nrefinancing transaction. The Company expensed approximately $2.1 million for the unamortized issuance costs associated with this commitment which is\npresented in “Interest expense, net” in the consolidated statement of operations.\nMaturities of long-term debt — Assuming repayment by the Anticipated Repayment Dates and based on the leverage ratio as of September 29, 2024,\nprincipal payments on our long-term debt outstanding at September 29, 2024 for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\n2025 $ 35,880\n2026 289,156\n2027 516,034\n2028 15,538\n2029 427,292\nThereafter 467,638\n$ 1,751,538\nF-23\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

Some of these owned or leased sites are leased and/or\nsubleased to franchisees. Initial terms of our real estate leases are generally 20 years, exclusive of options to renew, which are generally exercisable at our sole\ndiscretion for 1 to 20 years. In some instances, our leases have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined revenues. Many of our\nrestaurants also have rent escalation clauses and require the payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Variable lease costs include\ncontingent rent, cost-of-living index adjustments, and payments for additional rent such as real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, which\nare excluded from the measurement of the lease liability. We also lease certain restaurant and office equipment with initial terms generally ranging from 3 to 8\nyears. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nAs lessor, our leases and subleases primarily consist of restaurants that have been leased to franchisees subsequent to refranchising transactions. The lease\ndescriptions, terms, variable lease payments and renewal options are generally the same as the lessee leases described above. Revenues from leasing\narrangements with our franchisees are presented in “Franchise rental revenues” in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings, and the related\nexpenses are presented in “Franchise occupancy expenses.”\nCompany as lessee — Leased assets and liabilities consisted of the following as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, October 1,\n2024 2023\nAssets:\nOperating lease ROU assets $ 1,410,083 $ 1,397,555\nFinance lease ROU assets (1) 416 971\nTotal ROU assets $ 1,410,499 $ 1,398,526\nLiabilities:\nCurrent operating lease liabilities $ 162,017 $ 142,518\nCurrent finance lease liabilities (2) 602 689\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 1,286,415 1,265,514\nLong-term finance lease liabilities (2) — 627\nTotal lease liabilities $ 1,449,034 $ 1,409,348\n________________________\n(1) Included in “Property and equipment, net” on our consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Included in “Current maturities of long-term debt” and “Long-term debt, net of current maturities” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents the components of our lease costs in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 (in thousands):\n2024 2023 2022\nLease costs:\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of ROU assets (1) $ 492 $ 691 $ 827\nInterest on lease liabilities (2) 68 55 67\nOperating lease cost (3) 243,488 240,153 218,837\nShort-term lease cost (3) 195 730 824\nVariable lease cost (3)(4) 51,374 50,448 48,872\n$ 295,617 $ 292,077 $ 269,427\n________________________\n(1) Included in “Depreciation and amortization” in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n(2) Included in “Interest expense, net” in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n(3) Operating lease, short-term and variable lease costs associated with franchisees and company-operated restaurants are included in “Franchise occupancy expenses” and “Occupancy and other,”\nrespectively, in our consolidated statements of earnings.

SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company’s principal business consists of developing, operating and franchising our Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurant brands, each of which is\nconsidered a reportable operating segment. In 2024, our chief operating decision maker revised the method by which they determine performance and strategy\nfor our segments. This change was made to reflect a shared-services model whereby each brand’s results of operations are assessed separately and do not\ninclude costs related to certain corporate functions which support both brands. This segment reporting structure reflects the Company’s current management\nstructure, internal reporting method and financial information used in deciding how to allocate Company resources. Based upon certain quantitative thresholds,\neach operating segment is considered a reportable segment. This change to our segment reporting did not change our reporting units for goodwill.\nThe Company measures and evaluates our segments based on segment revenues and segment profit. The reportable segments do not include an allocation\nof the costs related to shared service functions, such as accounting/finance, human resources, audit services, legal, tax and treasury. These costs are reflected in\nthe caption “Shared services” below.\nOur measure of segment profit excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) gains/ losses,\nnet of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies, acquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives, gains on the\nsale of company-operated restaurants, gains on acquisition of restaurants, and amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net.\nF-27\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

RETIREMENT PLANS\nWe sponsor programs that provide retirement benefits to our employees. These programs include defined contribution plans, defined benefit pension plans,\nand postretirement healthcare plans.\nDefined contribution plans — At the beginning of fiscal year 2024, we maintained two qualified savings plans pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal\nRevenue Code (“IRC”); the Jack in the Box Inc. Easy$aver Plus Plan and the Del Taco Savings Plan. Effective January 1, 2024, the Del Taco Savings Plan was\nmerged into the Easy$aver Plus Plan so that now we maintain one qualified savings plan. The plan allows all employees who meet certain age and minimum\nservice requirements to defer a percentage of their pay on a pre-tax basis. Our contributions under these plans were $3.3 million, $2.3 million, and $2.1 million\nin each fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nWe also maintain an unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plan for key executives and other members of management whose compensation\ndeferrals or company matching contributions to the qualified savings plan are limited due to IRC rules. Effective January 1, 2016, this non-qualified plan was\namended to replace the company matching contribution with an annual restoration match that is intended to “restore” up to the full match for participants\nwhose elective deferrals (and related company matching contributions) to the qualified savings plan were limited due to IRC rules. A participant’s right to the\nCompany restoration match vests immediately. This plan allows participants to defer up to 50% of their salary and 85% of their bonus, on a pre-tax basis. Our\ncontributions under the non-qualified deferred compensation plan were $0.2 million in fiscal year 2024, $0.1 million in fiscal year 2023, and less than $0.1\nmillion in fiscal year 2022.\nDefined benefit pension plans — We sponsor two defined benefit pension plans, a “Qualified Plan” covering substantially all full-time employees hired\nprior to January 1, 2011, and an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) which provides certain employees additional pension benefits and\nwas closed to new participants effective January 1, 2007. In fiscal 2011, the Board of Directors approved changes to our Qualified Plan whereby participants no\nlonger accrue benefits effective December 31, 2015. Benefits under both plans are based on the employees’ years of service and compensation over defined\nperiods of employment.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company amended its Qualified Plan to purchase certain annuity contracts from a third-party company, relieving\nthe Company of its related obligation for future payment (the “Annuity Purchase Agreement”). As a result of the Annuity Purchase Agreement, the Company’s\nQualified Plan paid $14.4 million from its plan assets to the third-party, thereby reducing the plan’s pension benefit obligation (“PBO”).\nPostretirement healthcare plans — We also sponsor two healthcare plans, closed to new participants, that provide postretirement medical benefits to\ncertain employees who have met minimum age and service requirements. The plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually, and contain\nother cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.\nF-30\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nAdditional year-end pension plan information — The PBO represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to\ndate, including the effects of estimated future pay increases. The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) also reflects the actuarial present value of benefits\nattributable to employee service rendered to date but does not include the effects of estimated future pay increases. Therefore, the ABO as compared to plan\nassets is an indication of the assets currently available to fund vested and nonvested benefits accrued through the end of the fiscal year. The funded status is\nmeasured as the difference between the fair value of a plan’s assets and its PBO. Since the Qualified Plan is frozen and the SERP has no active participants, the\nPBO and ABO are equal.\nAs of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively, the Qualified Plan’s ABO was less than the fair value of its plan assets. The SERP is an\nunfunded plan and, as such, had no plan assets as of September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023. The following sets forth the PBO, ABO, and fair value of plan\nassets of our pension plans as of the measurement date in each fiscal year (in thousands):\n2024 2023\nQualified Plan:\nProjected benefit obligation $ 297,920 $ 266,345\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 297,920 $ 266,345\nFair value of plan assets $ 302,439 $ 275,143\nSERP:\nProjected benefit obligation $ 57,097 $ 53,513\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 57,097 $ 53,513\nFair value of plan assets $ — $ —\nNet periodic benefit cost — The components of the fiscal year net periodic benefit cost were as follows (in thousands):\n2024 2023 2022\nQualified Plan:\nInterest cost $ 15,791 $ 16,068 $ 12,506\nExpected return on plan assets (14,982) (15,105) (18,103)\nActuarial loss 2,403 2,349 2,193\nNet periodic benefit (credit) cost $ 3,212 $ 3,312 $ (3,404)\nSERP:\nInterest cost $ 3,188 $ 3,149 $ 2,173\nActuarial loss 632 718 1,666\nAmortization of unrecognized prior service cost 14 19 19\nNet periodic benefit cost $ 3,834 $ 3,886 $ 3,858\nPostretirement health plans:\nInterest cost $ 711 $ 700 $ 489\nActuarial (gain) loss (914) (932) (640)\nNet periodic benefit (credit) cost $ (203) $ (232) $ (151)\nPrior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis from date of participation to full eligibility. Unrecognized gains or losses are amortized using the\n“corridor approach” under which the net gain or loss in excess of 10% of the greater of the PBO or the market-related value of the assets, if applicable, is\namortized. For our Qualified Plan, actuarial losses are amortized over the average future expected lifetime of all participants expected to receive benefits. For\nour SERP, actuarial losses are amortized over the expected remaining future lifetime for inactive participants, and for our postretirement health plans, actuarial\nlosses are amortized over the expected remaining future lifetime of inactive participants expected to receive benefits.\nF-32\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nAssumptions — We determine our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis. In determining the present values of our benefit obligations and net periodic\nbenefit costs as of and for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2024, October 1, 2023, and October 2, 2022, we used the following weighted-average\nassumptions:\n2024 2023 2022\nAssumptions used to determine benefit obligations (1) (2):\nQualified Plan:\nDiscount rate 5.11% 6.10% 5.63%\nSERP:\nDiscount rate 5.09% 6.26% 5.80%\nPostretirement health plans:\nDiscount rate 5.09% 6.27% 5.82%\nAssumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost (2) (3):\nQualified Plan:\nDiscount rate 6.10% 5.63% 3.11%\nLong-term rate of return on assets 5.60% 5.10% 4.50%\nSERP:\nDiscount rate 6.26% 5.80% 2.99%\nPostretirement health plans:\nDiscount rate 6.27% 5.82% 2.95%\n________________________\n(1) Determined as of end of year.\n(2) There is no assumed rate of increase, as there are no active employees in any of the fiscal years presented.\n(3) Determined as of beginning of year.\nThe assumed discount rates were determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a population of high-quality bonds with a\nMoody’s or Standard and Poor’s rating of “AA” or better whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the year-by-year projected benefit payments\nfrom the plans. As benefit payments typically extend beyond the date of the longest maturing bond, cash flows beyond 30 years were discounted back to the\n30th year and then matched like any other payment.\nThe assumed expected long-term rate of return on assets is the weighted-average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to\nprovide for the pension obligations. The long-term rate of return on assets was determined taking into consideration our projected asset allocation and\neconomic forecasts prepared with the assistance of our actuarial consultants.\nThe assumed discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on assets have a significant effect on amounts reported for our pension and postretirement\nplans. If the discount rate and expected rate of return on assets used were to decrease by 0.25%, fiscal 2024 earnings before income taxes would have decreased\nby $0.1 million and decreased by $1.0 million, respectively.\nFor measurement purposes, the weighted-average assumed health care cost trend rates for our postretirement health plans were as follows for each fiscal\nyear:\n2024 2023 2022\nHealthcare cost trend rate for next year:\nParticipants under age 65 6.25% 6.25% 6.25%\nParticipants age 65 or older 6.25% 6.25% 5.75%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline:\nParticipants under age 65 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%\nParticipants age 65 or older 4.50% 4.50% 4.50%\nYear the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate:\nParticipants under age 65 2031 2031 2030\nParticipants age 65 or older 2031 2031 2028\nThe assumed healthcare cost trend rate represents our estimate of the annual rates of change in the costs of the healthcare benefits currently provided by\nour postretirement plans. The healthcare cost trend rate implicitly considers estimates of healthcare inflation, changes in healthcare utilization and delivery\npatterns, technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants. The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on\nthe amounts reported.\nF-33\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nPlan assets — Our investment philosophy is to invest assets in a prudent manner to meet the obligation of providing benefits to Plan participants and their\nbeneficiaries in accordance with the time horizon appropriate for the Plan while employing asset diversification to minimize the risk of large losses. Our asset\nallocation strategy utilizes multiple investment managers in order to maximize the plan’s return while minimizing risk. We regularly monitor our asset\nallocation, and senior financial management and the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors review performance results quarterly. We continually review\nour target asset allocation for our Qualified Plan and when changes are made, we reallocate our plan assets over a period of time, as deemed appropriate by\nsenior financial management, to achieve our target asset allocation. Our plan asset allocation at the end of each fiscal 2024 and 2023 and respective target\nallocations were as follows:\n2024 Target Minimum Maximum\nCash & cash equivalents 1% —% —% —%\nGlobal equity 13% 12% 7% 17%\nAlternative credit 11% 9% 4% 14%\nReal assets 9% 9% 4% 14%\nLiability-hedging assets 66% 70% 60% 80%\n100% 100%\n2023 Target Minimum Maximum\nCash & cash equivalents 1% —% —% —%\nGlobal equity 11% 12% 7% 17%\nAlternative credit 10% 9% 4% 14%\nReal assets 10% 9% 4% 14%\nLiability-hedging assets 68% 70% 60% 80%\n100% 100%\nThe Company measures its defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the month-end date closest to its fiscal year end, which is a practical expedient\nunder FASB authoritative guidance.

As of the date of our last actuarial funding valuation, there\nwas no minimum requirement. We do not anticipate making any contributions to our Qualified Plan in fiscal 2025. Contributions expected to be paid in the\nnext fiscal year, the projected benefit payments for each of the next five fiscal years, and the total aggregate amount for the subsequent five fiscal years are as\nfollows (in thousands):\nDefined Benefit Postretirement\nPlans Health Plans\nEstimated net contributions during fiscal 2025 $ 5,125 $ 1,139\nEstimated future year benefit payments during fiscal years:\n2025 $ 20,487 $ 1,139\n2026 $ 20,825 $ 1,150\n2027 $ 21,200 $ 1,155\n2028 $ 21,600 $ 1,150\n2029 $ 21,985 $ 1,139\n2030-2034 $ 115,261 $ 5,245\nWe will continue to evaluate contributions to our Qualified Plan based on changes in pension assets as a result of asset performance in the current market\nand economic environment. Expected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure our benefit obligations at September 29, 2024 and\ninclude estimated future employee service, if applicable.\n13. SHARE-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION\nStock incentive plans — We offer share-based compensation plans to attract, retain, and motivate key officers, employees, and non-employee directors to\nwork toward the financial success of the Company.\nOur stock incentive plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and have been approved by the stockholders of the\nCompany. The terms and conditions of our share-based awards are determined by the Compensation Committee for each award date and may include\nprovisions for the exercise price, expirations, vesting, restriction on sales, and forfeitures, as applicable. We issue new shares to satisfy stock issuances under\nour stock incentive plans.\nOur Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (“Prior Plan”) authorized the issuance of up to 11,600,000 common shares in connection with the\ngranting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, or performance units to our\nemployees and directors. As of January 1, 2023, no additional awards were granted under the Prior Plan. Our Jack in the Box Inc. 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan\n(“Plan”) authorizes the issuance of up to 2,500,000 common shares plus Prior Plan returning shares in connection with outstanding awards as of January 6,\n2023 that on or following such date are not issued, settled in cash, or fail to vest. The Plan is intended to help the Company secure and retain the services of\neligible award recipients, provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts for the success of the Company, and provide a means by which such\npersons may benefit from increases in value of the common stock. The Plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted\nstock awards, restricted stock unit awards, or performance stock awards, to our employees and directors. There were 1,987,156 shares of common stock\navailable for future issuance under this plan as of September 29, 2024.\nWe also maintain a deferred compensation plan for non-management directors under which those who are eligible to receive fees or retainers may choose\nto defer receipt of their compensation. The deferred amounts are converted to stock equivalents. The plan requires settlement in shares of our common stock\nbased on the number of stock equivalents and dividend equivalents at the time of a participant’s separation from the Board of Directors. This plan provides for\nthe issuance of up to 350,000 shares of common stock in connection with the crediting of stock equivalents. There were 106,576 shares of common stock\navailable for future issuance under this plan as of September 29, 2024.\nF-35\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

Grants to\nexecutive officers of time-vesting RSUs vest ratably over four years or three years, are subject to a stock holding requirement of 50% of after-tax net shares\nresulting from the vesting of RSUs, and must be held until the multiple of base salary stock ownership is met. There were 22,582 RSU’s vesting over four\nyears, and 104,419 RSU’s vesting over three years, outstanding as of September 29, 2024. RSUs issued to non-management directors vest 12 months from the\ndate of grant, or upon termination of board service, including RSUs for which the director elected to defer receipt until termination of board service, and totaled\n77,470 units outstanding as of September 29, 2024. RSUs issued to certain other employees either cliff vest or vest ratably over three years and totaled 177,267\nunits outstanding as of September 29, 2024. These awards are amortized to compensation expense over the estimated vesting period based upon the fair value\nof our common stock on the award date discounted by the present value of the expected dividend stream over the vesting period.\nThe following is a summary of RSU activity for fiscal 2024:\nWeighted-\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nShares Value\nRSUs outstanding at October 1, 2023 328,536 $ 70.97\nGranted 204,908 $ 67.74\nReleased (113,773) $ 69.90\nForfeited (37,933) $ 70.70\nRSUs outstanding at September 29, 2024 381,738 $ 69.59\nAs of September 29, 2024, there was approximately $11.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs, which is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted was $67.74, $68.56, and $78.28 in fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the total fair value of RSUs that vested and were released was $8.0 million,\n$4.6 million, and $2.5 million, respectively.\nStock options — Option grants have contractual terms of seven years and employee options vest over a three-year period. Options may vest sooner upon\nretirement from the Company for employees meeting certain age and years of service thresholds. All option grants provide for an option exercise price equal to\nthe closing market value of the common stock on the date of grant.\nThe following is a summary of stock option activity for fiscal 2024:\nWeighted-\nWeighted- Average Aggregate\nAverage Remaining Intrinsic\nExercise Contractual Value\nShares Price Term (Years) (in thousands)\nOptions outstanding at October 1, 2023 28,950 $ 94.92\nExpired (14,939) $ 104.95\nOptions outstanding at September 29, 2024 14,011 $ 84.23 1.12 $ —\nOptions exercisable at September 29, 2024 14,011 $ 84.23 1.12 $ —\nThe aggregate intrinsic value in the table above is the amount by which the current market price of our stock on September 29, 2024 exceeds the weighted-\naverage exercise price.\nF-36\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nWe use a valuation model to determine the fair value of options granted that requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected\nvolatility of the stock price. No stock option awards were granted in fiscal 2024, 2023, or 2022.\nAs of September 29, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options grants. There were no stock options exercised in fiscal\nyear 2024. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was less than $0.1 million in fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPerformance share awards — Performance share awards, granted in the form of stock units, represent a right to receive a certain number of shares of\ncommon stock based on the achievement of corporate performance goals and continued employment during the vesting period. Performance share awards\nissued to executives vest at the end of a three-year period and vested amounts may range from 0% to a maximum of 150% of targeted amounts depending on\nthe achievement of performance measures at the end of a three-year period. If the awardee ceases to be employed by the Company prior to the last day of the\nperformance period due to retirement, disability, or death, the performance share awards become vested pro-rata based on the number of full accounting\nperiods the awardee was continuously employed by the Company during the performance period. The expected cost of the shares is based on the fair value of\nour stock on the date of grant and is reflected over the vesting period with a reduction for estimated forfeitures. These awards may be settled in cash or shares\nof common stock at the election of the Company on the date of grant. It is our intent to settle these awards with shares of common stock.\nThe following is a summary of performance share award activity for fiscal 2024:\nWeighted-\nAverage Grant\nDate Fair\nShares Value\nPerformance share awards outstanding at October 1, 2023 107,174 $ 72.51\nGranted 62,103 $ 70.19\nIssued (29,922) $ 88.88\nForfeited (4,162) $ 69.26\nPerformance adjustments 9,974 $ 88.88\nPerformance share awards outstanding at September 29, 2024 145,167 $ 70.53\nAs of September 29, 2024, there was approximately $3.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance share awards, which is\nexpected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The weighted-average grant date fair value of awards granted was $70.19, $65.74, and\n$78.95 in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The total fair value of awards that became fully vested during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was\n$2.7 million, $1.8 million, and $0.1 million, respectively.\nNonvested restricted stock awards — As part of the Merger Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company assumed Del Taco’s historical equity\ncompensation plans. The awards under Del Taco’s historical equity compensation plans that were not subject to accelerated vesting were exchanged for\nreplacement awards of the Company, which included Del Taco’s non-accelerating restricted stock awards. Immediately following the Merger, these\nreplacement awards were modified to accelerate the remaining vesting period to be one year following the Closing Date, other than the awards already\nscheduled to vest on June 30, 2022.\nAs of September 29, 2024, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock awards. The total fair value of awards that vested and\nwere released during fiscal 2023 was $0.4 million.\nNon-management directors’ deferred compensation — All awards outstanding under our directors’ deferred compensation plan are accounted for as\nequity-based awards and deferred amounts are converted into stock equivalents based on a per share price equal to the average of the closing price of our\ncommon stock for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the date the deferred compensation is credited to the director’s account. During fiscal 2024, 2023,\nand 2022, 36,342 shares of common stock were issued in connection with a director retirement.\nF-37\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT\nRepurchases of common stock — In fiscal 2024, the Company purchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate cost of $70.6 million,\nincluding applicable excise tax. As of September 29, 2024, there was $180.0 million remaining amount under share repurchase programs authorized by the\nBoard of Directors which do not expire.\nDividends — In fiscal 2024, the Board of Directors declared four cash dividends of $0.44, respectively, totaling $34.2 million. Future dividends are subject\nto approval by our Board of Directors.\n15. AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING\nOur basic earnings per share calculation is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Our diluted earnings per share\ncalculation is computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding adjusted by the number of additional shares that would have\nbeen outstanding had the potentially dilutive common shares been issued. Potentially dilutive common shares include nonvested stock awards and units, stock\noptions, and non-management director stock equivalents. Performance share awards are included in the average diluted shares outstanding each period if the\nperformance criteria have been met at the end of the respective periods.\nThe following table reconciles basic weighted-average shares outstanding to diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in each fiscal year (in\nthousands):\n2024 2023 2022\nWeighted-average shares outstanding — basic 19,572 20,603 21,195\nEffect of potentially dilutive securities:\nNonvested stock awards and units — 134 47\nStock options — 1 1\nPerformance share awards — 26 2\nWeighted-average shares outstanding — diluted 19,572 20,764 21,245\nExcluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding:\nAntidilutive 153 25 23\nPerformance conditions not satisfied at the end of the period 145 81 61\n16. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPurchase commitments — Jack in the Box and Del Taco have long-term food and beverage supply agreements with certain major vendors, which provide\nfood and fountain drink products and marketing support funding to the Company and its franchisees. These agreements require minimum purchases by the\nCompany and its franchisees at agreed upon prices until the total volume commitments have been reached. Based on current pricing and ratio of usage at\ncompany-operated to franchised restaurants as of September 29, 2024, total food and beverage purchase requirements under these agreements is estimated to be\napproximately $89.9 million over the next six years.\nWe also have entered into various arrangements with vendors providing information technology services with no early termination fees. The Company’s\nunconditional purchase obligations on these contracts total approximately $10.6 million over the next four years.\nF-38\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nLegal matters — The Company assesses contingencies, including litigation contingencies, to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss\nfor potential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had accruals of $16.2 million for all of its legal\nmatters in aggregate, presented within “Accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing\ncontingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a\nmeaningful estimate due to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance\ncoverage related to the claim or claims in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information\nimportant to the matter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and\nas such are not meaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy\nof the accruals and related disclosures. The ultimate amount of loss may differ from these estimates. Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any,\nor of the Company’s maximum possible loss exposure and the ultimate amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates in the near term.\nGessele v. Jack in the Box Inc. — In August 2010, five former Jack in the Box employees instituted litigation in federal court in Oregon alleging claims\nunder the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and Oregon wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs alleged that Jack in the Box failed to pay non-exempt employees for\ncertain meal breaks and improperly made payroll deductions for shoe purchases and for workers’ compensation expenses, and later added additional claims\nrelating to timing of final pay and related wage and hour claims involving employees of a franchisee. In 2016, the court dismissed the federal claims and those\nrelating to franchise employees. In June 2017, the court granted class certification with respect to state law claims of improper deductions and late payment of\nfinal wages. The parties participated in a voluntary mediation on March 16, 2020, but the matter did not settle. On October 24, 2022, a jury awarded plaintiffs\napproximately $6.4 million in damages and penalties. The Company continues to dispute liability and the damage award and will defend against both through\npost-trial motions and all other available appellate remedies. As of September 29, 2024, the Company has accrued the verdict amount above, as well as pre-\njudgment and post-judgment interest and an estimated fee award, for an additional $9.3 million. These amounts are included within “Accrued liabilities” on our\nconsolidated balance sheet as of September 29, 2024. The Company will continue to accrue for post-judgment interest until the matter is resolved.\nTorrez — In March 2014, a former Del Taco employee filed a purported Private Attorneys General Act claim and class action alleging various causes of\naction under California’s labor, wage, and hour laws. The plaintiff generally alleges Del Taco did not appropriately provide meal and rest breaks and failed to\npay wages and reimburse business expenses to its California non-exempt employees. On November 12, 2021, the court granted, in part, the plaintiff's motion\nfor class certification. The parties participated in a voluntary mediation on May 24, 2022 and June 3, 2022. On June 4, 2022, we entered into a Settlement\nMemorandum of Understanding (the “Agreement”) which obligates the Company to pay a gross settlement amount of $50.0 million, for which in exchange we\nwill be released from all claims by the parties. On August 8, 2023, the court issued its final approval of the settlement and on August 9, 2023 final judgment\nwas entered. The Company made the full payments for the settlement amounts. As of September 29, 2024, the Company has no further amounts accrued on its\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nJ&D Restaurant Group — On April 17, 2019, the trustee for a bankrupt former franchisee filed a complaint generally alleging the Company wrongfully\nterminated the franchise agreements and unreasonably denied two perspective purchasers the former franchisee presented. The parties participated in a\nmediation in April 2021, and again in December 2022, but the matter did not settle. Trial commenced on January 9, 2023. On February 8, 2023, the jury\nreturned a verdict finding the Company had not breached any contracts in terminating the franchise agreements or denying the proposed buyers. However,\nwhile the jury also found the Company had not violated the California Unfair Practices Act, it found for the plaintiff on the claim for breach of implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and awarded $8.0 million in damages. On May 9, 2023, the court granted the Company’s post-trial motion, overturning\nthe jury verdict and ordering the plaintiff take nothing on its claims. As a result, the Company reversed the prior $8.0 million accrual, and as of September 29,\n2024, the Company has no amounts accrued for this case on its consolidated balance sheet. The Plaintiff has appealed the trial court’s post-trial rulings.\nOther legal matters — In addition to the matters described above, we are subject to normal and routine litigation brought by former or current employees,\ncustomers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders, or others. We intend to defend ourselves in any such matters. Some of these matters may be covered,\nat least in part, by insurance or other third-party indemnity obligation. We record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be\nprobable.\nF-39\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nLease guarantees — We remain contingently liable for certain leases relating to our former Qdoba business which we sold in fiscal 2018. Under the\nQdoba Purchase Agreement, the buyer has indemnified the Company of all claims related to these guarantees. As of September 29, 2024, the maximum\npotential liability of future undiscounted payments under these leases is approximately $20.1 million. The lease terms extend for a maximum of\napproximately 13 more years, and we would remain a guarantor of the leases in the event the leases are extended for any established renewal periods. In the\nevent of default, we believe the exposure is limited due to contractual protections and recourse available in the lease agreements, as well as the Qdoba Purchase\nAgreement, including a requirement of the landlord to mitigate damages by re-letting the properties in default, and indemnity from the Buyer. The Company\nhas not recorded a liability for these guarantees as we believe the likelihood of making any future payments is remote.\n17.

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Earnings\n\nAugust 6, 2024\n\n**Jack in the Box same-store sales of (2.2%)**\n\n**Del Taco same-store sales of (3.9%)**\n\n**Jack in the Box systemwide sales of (1.3%); Del Taco systemwide sales of (3.2%)**\n\n**Diluted loss per share of ($6.26), including a $162.6 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge for Del Taco**\n\n**Operating EPS of $1.65**\n\n**Jack in the Box signed 3 development agreements with new franchisees for 28 new restaurants**\n\n**Jack in the Box entering Chicago market with multiple company-owned openings in FY 2025**\n\n**Jack in the Box progressing on tech and digital transformation with nearly 100 restaurants on our new POS system and our next generation app going live on September 1st**\n\n**Del Taco's three most recent restaurant openings, in Florida and Virginia, all set new company records for first-week sales**\n\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  **Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ: JACK)** announced financial results for the Jack in the Box and Del Taco brands in the third quarter, ended July 7, 2024. \n\n“I am proud of our teams and how they continue to enhance the guest experience and deliver operational improvements during a challenging sales environment for our entire industry,” said Darin Harris, Jack in the Box Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to focus on value and ways we can improve transactions with the low-income guest — while at the same time, doubling down on our strengths of innovation, variety and late night. We will strive to finish the year strong with positive momentum heading into 2025, while continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives to achieve our long-term growth and profitability ambitions.” \n\n** Jack in the Box Performance **\n\nSame-store sales decreased 2.2% in the third quarter, comprised of franchise same-store sales decline of 2.4% and company-owned same-store sales increase of 0.1%. Transactions were down from prior year although slightly improved from last quarter. Systemwide sales for the third quarter decreased 1.3%. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin (1) , a non-GAAP measure, was $21.1 million, or 21.0%, down from $21.1 million, or 21.8%, a year ago driven primarily by higher costs for labor and other restaurant operating costs, partially offset by lower food and packaging costs. The increase in labor was driven in large part from implementing California's new minimum wage law. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin (1) , a non-GAAP measure, was $74.6 million, or 41.1%, a decrease from $75.3 million, or 41.1%, a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by the decline in franchise sales for the quarter. \n\nJack in the Box net restaurant count remained flat in the third quarter, with three restaurant openings and three restaurant closures. Since the launch of the development program in mid-2021, the company has 96 signed agreements for a total of 437 restaurants, with 46 restaurants opened to date. \n\n**Jack in the Box Same-Store Sales:** |  **12 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**July 7, 2024** |  **July 9, 2023**  \nCompany  |  0.1%  |  6.9%   \nFranchise  |  (2.4%)  |  8.0%   \nSystem  |  (2.2%)  |  7.9%   \n  \n**Jack in the Box Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nRestaurant count at Q2'24  |  144  |  2,051  |  2,195  |  140  |  2,047  |  2,187   \nNew  |  —  |  3  |  3  |  —  |  6  |  6   \nClosed  |  —  |  (3  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  —  |  (2  |  )  |  (2  |  )   \nRestaurant count at end of Q3'24  |  144  |  2,051  |  2,195  |  140  |  2,051  |  2,191   \nQ3'24 QTD Net Restaurant Increase  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nYTD Net Restaurant Increase  |  1.4  |  %  |  0.3  |  %  |  0.4  |  %   \n  \n** Del Taco Performance **\n\nSame-store sales decreased 3.9% in the third quarter, comprised of franchise same-store sales decline of 4.1% and company-operated same-store sales decline of 3.5%. Sales performance resulted from a decline in transactions, partially offset by an increase in average check. Systemwide sales for the fiscal third quarter decreased 3.2%. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin (1) , a non-GAAP measure, was $8.8 million, or 13.4%, down from $17.7 million, or 17.4%, a year ago. The decrease was due mainly to refranchising restaurants, and the margin percentage decline was driven by increased costs for labor and utilities, partially offset by menu price increases. The increase in labor as a percentage of sales was a result of implementing California's new minimum wage law and the sales decline. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin (1) , a non-GAAP measure, was $5.8 million, or 27.1%, compared to $5.5 million, or 36.7%, a year ago. The decrease in margin percentage was driven by the impact of refranchising and the associated increase in pass-thru rent and marketing fees. \n\nDel Taco restaurant count in the third quarter had five restaurant openings and three restaurant closings. Subsequent to the quarter, 27 Del Taco restaurants were refranchised, which included a development agreement for 25 additional restaurants. \n\n**Del Taco Same-Store Sales:** |  **12 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**July 7, 2024** |  **July 9, 2023**  \nCompany  |  (3.5%)  |  1.7%   \nFranchise  |  (4.1%)  |  1.8%   \nSystem  |  (3.9%)  |  1.7%   \n  \n**Del Taco Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nRestaurant count at Q2'24  |  166  |  429  |  595  |  273  |  322  |  595   \nNew  |  1  |  4  |  5  |  —  |  2  |  2   \nRefranchised  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (50  |  )  |  50  |  —   \nClosed  |  (2  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  (2  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  (3  |  )   \nRestaurant count at end of Q3'24  |  165  |  432  |  597  |  221  |  373  |  594   \nQ3'24 QTD Net Restaurant Increase  |  (1  |  )  |  3  |  2   \nYTD Net Restaurant Increase/(Decrease)  |  (3.5  |  )%  |  2.6  |  %  |  0.8  |  %   \n  \n** Company-Wide Performance **\n\nThird quarter diluted loss per share was ($6.26). Operating Earnings Per Share (2) , a non-GAAP measure, was $1.65 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $1.45 in the prior year quarter. \n\nTotal revenues decreased 7.0% to $369.2 million, compared to $396.9 million in the prior year quarter. The lower revenue is primarily the result of the Del Taco refranchising transactions. Net loss was ($122.3) million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, with the loss resulting from the goodwill impairment noted below. This compared with net earnings of $29.2 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA (3) , a non-GAAP measure, was $78.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $81.6 million for the prior year quarter. \n\nCompany-wide SG&A expense for the third quarter was $29.6 million, a decrease of $10.0 million compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due primarily to lower incentive-based compensation, a favorable adjustment to our workers compensation and general liability reserves, and gains on the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance policies. When excluding net COLI gains, G&A was 2.0% of systemwide sales. \n\nDuring the third quarter, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment of $162.6 million to the Del Taco reporting unit. This is a non-cash charge that does not impact future operations and is the result of an internal goodwill impairment assessment triggered by i) a recent negative trend in Del Taco same store sales, ii) lower margins due in part to wage increases required in California effective April 1, 2024 under AB 1228, iii) unfavorable changes in the economic environment impacting our industry, including inflation and interest rates, and iv) a sustained lower share price. \n\nThe income tax provisions reflect an effective tax rate of negative 0.1% in the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 32.6% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The rate for the quarter was primarily due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill. The non-GAAP adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 26.2%. \n\n(1) Restaurant-Level Margin and Franchise-Level Margin are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to earnings from operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the attachment to this release. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.\"   \n---  \n(2) Operating Earnings Per Share represents the diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, excluding certain adjustments.

We believe franchised and systemwide restaurant sales information is useful to investors as they have a direct effect on the company's profitability.   \n  \n**JACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES** **RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS TO GAAP RESULTS** **(Unaudited)**\n\nTo supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted Net Income, Operating Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level Margin and Franchise-Level Margin. Management believes that these measurements, when viewed with the company's results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations in the tables below, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period changes, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the company's core business without regard to potential distortions. \n\n**_Operating Earnings Per Share_ **\n\nOperating Earnings Per Share represents diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis excluding acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives, net COLI gains, pension and post-retirement benefit costs, goodwill impairment, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, excess tax (benefits) shortfall from share-based compensation arrangements, and the tax-related impacts of the above adjustments. Operating Earnings Per Share should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management believes Operating Earnings Per Share provides investors with a meaningful supplement of the company’s operating performance and period-over-period changes without regard to potential distortions. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income. Also below is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Per Share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted earnings per share: \n\n**12 Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**July 7, 2024** |  **July 9, 2023**  \nNet income, as reported  |  $  |  (122,300  |  )  |  $  |  29,168   \nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives (1)  |  4,723  |  2,463   \nNet COLI gains (2)  |  (3,223  |  )  |  (579  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (3)  |  1,579  |  1,608   \nGoodwill impairment (4)  |  162,624  |  —   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants (5)  |  65  |  (5,794  |  )   \nExcess tax (benefits) shortfall from share-based compensation arrangements  |  53  |  (72  |  )   \nTax impact of adjustments (6)  |  (11,366  |  )  |  3,238   \nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income  |  $  |  32,155  |  $  |  30,032   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted  |  19,541  |  20,649   \nDiluted earnings per share – GAAP  |  $  |  (6.26  |  )  |  $  |  1.41   \nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives (1)  |  0.24  |  0.12   \nNet COLI gains (2)  |  (0.16  |  )  |  (0.03  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (3)  |  0.08  |  0.08   \nGoodwill impairment (4)  |  8.32  |  —   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants (5)  |  0.00  |  (0.28  |  )   \nExcess tax (benefits) shortfall from share-based compensation arrangements  |  0.00  |  (0.00  |  )   \nTax impact of adjustments (6)  |  (0.58  |  )  |  0.15   \nOperating Earnings Per Share – non-GAAP (7)  |  $  |  1.65  |  $  |  1.45   \n____________________   \n---  \n(1)  |  Acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives reflect charges that are not part of our ongoing operations, including consulting fees for discrete project-based strategic initiatives that are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future.   \n(2)  |  Net COLI gains reflect market-based adjustments on the company-owned life insurance policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies.   \n(3)  |  Pension and post-retirement benefit costs relating to our two legacy defined benefit pension plans, as well as our two legacy post-retirement plans.   \n(4)  |  Represents the impairment taken on the Del Taco reporting unit goodwill.   \n(5)  |  Losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants   \n(6)  |  Tax impacts for the quarter calculated based on the non-GAAP Operating EPS tax rate of 26.2% in the current quarter and 26.8% in the prior year quarter.   \n(7)  |  Operating Earnings Per Share may not add due to rounding.   \n  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA_ **\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net earnings on a GAAP basis excluding income taxes, interest expense, net, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, other operating expenses (income), net, goodwill impairment, depreciation and amortization, amortization of cloud computing costs, amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net, amortization of franchise tenant improvement allowances and other, net COLI gains, and pension and post-retirement benefit costs. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company's ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net earnings (in thousands): \n\n**12 Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**July 7, 2024** |  **July 9, 2023**  \nNet earnings (loss) - GAAP  |  $  |  (122,300  |  )  |  $  |  29,168   \nIncome taxes  |  83  |  14,104   \nInterest expense, net  |  18,402  |  18,662   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  65  |  (5,794  |  )   \nOther operating expenses (income), net (1)  |  5,641  |  7,656   \nGoodwill impairment (2)  |  162,624  |  —   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  13,827  |  14,460   \nAmortization of cloud-computing costs (3)  |  787  |  1,170   \nAmortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net (4)  |  234  |  127   \nAmortization of franchise tenant improvement allowances and other  |  1,191  |  1,057   \nNet COLI gains (5)  |  (3,223  |  )  |  (579  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (6)  |  1,579  |  1,608   \nAdjusted EBITDA – non-GAAP  |  $  |  78,910  |  $  |  81,639   \n(1)  |  Other operating expense (income), net includes: acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives; costs of closed restaurants; operating restaurant impairment charges; accelerated depreciation and gains/losses on disposition of property and equipment, net.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Goodwill impairment charges recognized on the Del Taco reporting unit in the third quarter of 2024.   \n(3)  |  Amortization of cloud computing costs includes the amounts for the non-cash amortization of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud-based software arrangements that are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.   \n(4)  |  Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net, which is not already included in the other operating expense (income), net, noted above.   \n(5)  |  Net COLI gains reflect market-based adjustments on the company-owned life insurance policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies.   \n(6)  |  Pension and post-retirement benefit costs relating to our two legacy defined benefit pension plans, as well as the two legacy post-retirement plans.   \n  \n**_Restaurant-Level Margin_ **\n\nRestaurant-Level Margin is defined as company restaurant sales less restaurant operating costs (food and packaging, labor, and occupancy costs) and is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant-Level Margin excludes revenues and expenses of our franchise operations and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Certain other costs, such as depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment, other operating expenses (income), net, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, and other costs that are considered normal operating costs are excluded as they are considered corporate-level shared service costs. As such, Restaurant-Level Margin is not indicative of the overall results of the company and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Restaurant-Level Margin should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. The company is presenting Restaurant-Level Margin because it believes that it provides a meaningful supplement to net earnings of the company's core business operating results, as well as a comparison to those of other similar companies. Management utilizes Restaurant-Level Margin as a key performance indicator to evaluate the profitability of company-operated restaurants. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of non-GAAP Restaurant-Level Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, earnings from operations (in thousands): \n\n**12 weeks ended July 7, 2024**  \n---  \n**Jack in the Box** |  **Del Taco** |  **Other (1) ** |  **Total (2) **  \nEarnings from operations - GAAP  |  $  |  86,580  |  $  |  (154,004  |  )  |  $  |  (34,812  |  )  |  $  |  (102,236  |  )   \nFranchise rental revenues  |  (82,154  |  )  |  (6,971  |  )  |  —  |  (89,125  |  )   \nFranchise royalties and other  |  (47,822  |  )  |  (7,471  |  )  |  —  |  (55,293  |  )   \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services  |  (51,419  |  )  |  (6,854  |  )  |  —  |  (58,273  |  )   \nFranchise occupancy expenses  |  51,055  |  6,934  |  —  |  57,989   \nFranchise support and other costs  |  2,894  |  959  |  —  |  3,853   \nFranchise advertising and other services expenses  |  52,810  |  7,634  |  —  |  60,444   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  7,655  |  5,662  |  16,263  |  29,580   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  —  |  —  |  13,827  |  13,827   \nPre-opening costs  |  646  |  205  |  —  |  851   \nGoodwill impairment  |  —  |  162,624  |  —  |  162,624   \nOther operating expenses (income), net  |  871  |  48  |  4,722  |  5,641   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  —  |  65  |  —  |  65   \nRestaurant-Level Margin - Non-GAAP  |  $  |  21,116  |  $  |  8,831  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  29,947   \nCompany restaurant sales  |  $  |  100,355  |  $  |  66,125  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  166,480   \nRestaurant-Level Margin % - Non-GAAP  |  21.0  |  %  |  13.4  |  %  |  N/A  |  18.0  |  %   \n**12 weeks ended July 9, 2023**  \n**Jack in the Box** |  **Del Taco** |  **Other (1) ** |  **Total (2) **  \nEarnings from operations - GAAP  |  $  |  88,172  |  $  |  13,575  |  $  |  (38,205  |  )  |  $  |  63,542   \nFranchise rental revenues  |  (83,271  |  )  |  (2,977  |  )  |  —  |  (86,248  |  )   \nFranchise royalties and other  |  (48,761  |  )  |  (6,208  |  )  |  —  |  (54,969  |  )   \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services  |  (51,360  |  )  |  (5,849  |  )  |  —  |  (57,209  |  )   \nFranchise occupancy expenses  |  51,013  |  2,918  |  —  |  53,931   \nFranchise support and other costs  |  3,526  |  553  |  —  |  4,079   \nFranchise advertising and other services expenses  |  53,519  |  6,050  |  —  |  59,569   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  8,861  |  9,473  |  21,283  |  39,617   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  —  |  —  |  14,460  |  14,460   \nPre-opening costs  |  155  |  27  |  —  |  182   \nOther operating expenses (income), net  |  (633  |  )  |  5,827  |  2,462  |  7,656   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  (96  |  )  |  (5,698  |  )  |  —  |  (5,794  |  )   \nRestaurant-Level Margin - Non-GAAP  |  $  |  21,125  |  $  |  17,691  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  38,816   \nCompany restaurant sales  |  $  |  96,820  |  $  |  101,696  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  198,516   \nRestaurant-Level Margin % - Non-GAAP  |  21.8  |  %  |  17.4  |  %  |  N/A  |  19.6  |  %   \n(1)  |  The \"Other\" category includes shared services costs and other unallocated costs   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  The totals might not agree to consolidated within the Form 10-Q due to rounding.   \n  \n**_Franchise-Level Margin_ **\n\nFranchise-Level Margin is defined as franchise revenues less franchise operating costs (occupancy expenses, advertising contributions, and franchise support and other costs) and is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nNature of operations — Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, develops, operates, and franchises quick-service\nrestaurants under the Jack in the Box® and Del Taco® restaurant brands.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company acquired Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (“Del Taco”) for cash according to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of\nMerger, dated as of December 5, 2021.\nAs of July 7, 2024, there were 144 company-operated and 2,051 franchise-operated Jack in the Box restaurants and 165 company-operated and 432 franchise-\noperated Del Taco restaurants.\nReferences to the Company throughout these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements are made using the first person notations of “we,” “us” and\n“our.”\nBasis of presentation — The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThese financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”). The accounting policies used in preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are the same as those described in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nIn our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial condition and results of operations for these interim periods have been\nincluded. Operating results for one interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for any other interim period or for the full year.\nFiscal year — The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal year\nending the Tuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s fiscal\n2024 results include two fewer days. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 include 52 weeks. Our first quarter includes 16 weeks and all other quarters include 12 weeks.\nAll comparisons between 2024 and 2023 refer to the 12 weeks (“quarter”) and 40 weeks (“year-to-date”) ended July 7, 2024 and July 9, 2023, respectively,\nunless otherwise indicated.\nUse of estimates — In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make certain\nassumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. In making these\nassumptions and estimates, management may from time to time seek advice and consider information provided by actuaries and other experts in a particular\narea. Actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates.\nAdvertising costs — The Company administers marketing funds at each of its restaurant brands that include contractual contributions. In 2024 and 2023,\nmarketing fund contributions from Jack in the Box franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 5.0% of sales, and marketing fund\ncontributions from Del Taco franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 4.0% of sales. Year-to-date incremental contributions made by\nthe Company for both brands were $0.6 million in 2024, and less than $0.1 million in 2023, respectively.\nTotal contributions made by the Company are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of earnings and for the quarter and year-to-date totaled $8.2 million and $26.4 million, respectively, in 2024, and $9.0 million and $30.3 million,\nrespectively in 2023.\nAllowance for credit losses — The Company closely monitors the financial condition of our franchisees and estimates the allowance for credit losses based on\nthe lifetime expected loss on receivables. These estimates are based on historical collection experience with our franchisees as well as other factors, including\ncurrent market conditions and events. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments compared to predefined aging criteria and known facts\nregarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\n8\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9,\n2024 2023\nBalance as of beginning of period $ (4,146) $ (5,975)\n(Provision) reversal for expected credit losses (233) 1,833\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance 6 41\nBalance as of end of period $ (4,373) $ (4,101)\nBusiness combinations — The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired, including the\namount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill and trademarks — Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, if any. We generally record\ngoodwill in connection with the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees or the acquisition of another business. Likewise, upon the sale of restaurants to\nfranchisees, goodwill is decremented. The amount of goodwill written-off is determined as the fair value of the business disposed of as a percentage of the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit prior to the disposal. If the business disposed of was never fully integrated into the reporting unit after its acquisition, and thus the\nbenefits of the acquired goodwill were never realized, the current carrying amount of the acquired goodwill is written off.\nGoodwill is not amortized and has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The Company’s two restaurant brands, Jack in the Box\nand Del Taco, are both operating segments and reporting units. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting\nunits exceed their carrying values.\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. The\nCompany performs this testing during the third quarter of each year.\nOur impairment analyses first includes a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Significant factors considered in this assessment include, but are not limited to, macro-economic\nconditions, market and industry conditions, cost considerations, the competitive environment, share price fluctuations, overall financial performance, and\nresults of past impairment tests. If the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we perform a\nquantitative impairment test. Refer also to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for results of\nthese tests and for additional information.\nRecent accounting pronouncements — In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosure,” which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements. The ASU primarily requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses and information used to assess segment performance and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement\nin our disclosures, and does not expect it to have a significant impact.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard\nretrospectively. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to have a significant impact.\n2. REVENUE\nNature of products and services — The Company derives revenue from retail sales at Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated restaurants and rental\nrevenue, royalties, advertising, and franchise and other fees from franchise-operated restaurants.\nOur franchise arrangements generally provide for an initial franchise fee per restaurant for a 20-year term, and generally require that franchisees pay royalty\nand marketing fees based upon a percentage of gross sales. The agreements also require franchisees to pay technology fees for both brands, as well as sourcing\nfees for Jack in the Box franchise agreements.\n9\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

The payment represented the difference between the royalty rates based on projected future sales for\nthe remaining term of the existing agreements. The payment was non-refundable and not subject to any adjustments based on actual future sales. The Company\ndetermined the transaction represented the termination of the existing agreement rather than the transfer of an agreement between franchisees. As such, the $7.3 million\nwas recognized in franchise royalty revenue during the first quarter of 2023.\nContract liabilities — Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue resulting from initial franchise and development fees received from franchisees for new\nrestaurant openings or new franchise terms, which are recognized over the franchise term. The Company classifies these contract liabilities as “Accrued\nliabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nA summary of significant changes in contract liabilities is presented below (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9,\n2024 2023\nDeferred franchise and development fees at beginning of period $ 50,471 $ 46,449\nRevenue recognized (4,490) (4,140)\nAdditions 4,243 6,665\nDeferred franchise and development fees at end of period $ 50,224 $ 48,974\nAs of July 7, 2024, approximately $8.7 million of development fees related to unopened restaurants are included in deferred revenue. Timing of revenue\nrecognition for development fees related to unopened restaurants is dependent upon the timing of restaurant openings and are recognized over the franchise\nterm at the date of opening.\n10\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

The purchase price allocations\nwere based on fair value estimates determined using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\n5. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during year-to-date period ended July 7, 2024 was as follows (in thousands):\nJack in the Box Del Taco Total\nGoodwill $ 136,027 $ 193,959 $ 329,986\nAccumulated impairment losses — — —\nBalance at October 1, 2023 $ 136,027 $ 193,959 $ 329,986\nImpairment of goodwill — (162,624) (162,624)\nSale of Del Taco company-operated restaurants to franchisees — (105) (105)\nReclassified to assets held for sale (173) (5,439) (5,612)\nGoodwill 135,854 188,415 324,269\nAccumulated impairment losses — (162,624) (162,624)\nBalance at July 7, 2024 $ 135,854 $ 25,791 $ 161,645\nAs of the June 9, 2024 testing date, the balance of the Del Taco reporting unit goodwill was $194.0 million. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company\nidentified triggering events that indicated the goodwill allocated to the Del Taco reporting unit might be impaired. The triggering events related to i) a recent\nnegative trend in Del Taco same store sales, ii) lower margins due in part to lower sales and wage increases required in California effective April 1, 2024 under\nAB 1228, iii) unfavorable changes in the economic environment specifically impacting our industry, including inflation and interest rates, and iv) a sustained\nlower share price. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative test over the Del Taco reporting unit, noting that the fair value of the reporting unit was\nless than the carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of goodwill of $162.6 million.\nThe valuation used a blended approach with a discounted cash flow analysis in conjunction with a market approach. Assumptions and estimates used in\ndetermining fair value include future revenues, operating costs, new store openings, capital expenditures, a discount rate that approximates the Company’s\nweighted average cost of capital and a selection of comparable companies. The Company also performed a quantitative analysis over its indefinte-lived\nintangible trademark asset, as well as\n12\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nover its definite-lived intangible assets to determine whether any impairment would need to be recognized, noting none. The company also performed a\nquantitative analysis over its long-lived assets, noting impairment of $0.1 million, which was recorded in the quarter.\nThe Company determined that there was no such triggering event for the Jack in the Box reporting unit.\nThe net carrying amounts of intangible assets other than goodwill with definite lives are as follows (in thousands):\nJuly 7, October 1,\n2024 2023\nAccumulated Accumulated\nGross Amount Amortization Net Amount Gross Amount Amortization Net Amount\nDefinite-lived intangible assets:\nSublease assets $ 2,671 $ (564) $ 2,107 $ 2,671 $ (381) $ 2,290\nFranchise contracts 9,700 (1,264) 8,436 9,700 (850) 8,850\nReacquired franchise rights 464 (134) 330 297 (107) 190\n$ 12,835 $ (1,962) $ 10,873 $ 12,668 $ (1,338) $ 11,330\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets:\nDel Taco trademark $ 283,500 $ — $ 283,500 $ 283,500 $ — $ 283,500\n$ 283,500 $ — $ 283,500 $ 283,500 $ — $ 283,500\nThe following table summarizes, as of July 7, 2024, the estimated amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter (in thousands):\nRemainder of 2024 $ 187\n2025 816\n2026 814\n2027 826\n2028 772\nThereafter 7,458\n$ 10,873\n6. LEASES\nNature of leases — The Company owns restaurant sites and also leases restaurant sites from third parties. Some of these owned or leased sites are leased\nand/or subleased to franchisees. Initial terms of our real estate leases are generally 20 years, exclusive of options to renew, which are generally exercisable at\nour sole discretion for 1 to 20 years. In some instances, our leases have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined revenues. Many of\nour restaurants also have rent escalation clauses and require the payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Variable lease costs include\ncontingent rent, cost-of-living index adjustments, and payments for additional rent such as real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, which\nare excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.\nAs lessor, our leases and subleases primarily consist of restaurants that have been leased to franchisees in connection with refranchising transactions. Revenues\nfrom leasing arrangements with our franchisees are presented in “Franchise rental revenues” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\nearnings, and the related expenses are presented in “Franchise occupancy expenses.”\n13\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

However, on an\nannual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable, non-financial instruments are assessed\nfor impairment. If applicable, the carrying values are written down to fair value.\nIn connection with our impairment reviews performed during 2024, the Company impaired certain Del Taco assets.

In 2023, gains on\ndisposition of property and equipment primarily related to the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the properties from us prior\nto the sale.\n9. SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company’s principal business consists of developing, operating and franchising our Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurant brands, each of which is\nconsidered a reportable operating segment. In 2024, our chief operating decision maker revised the method by which they determine performance and strategy\nfor our segments. This change was made to reflect a shared-services model whereby each brand’s results of operations are assessed separately and do not\ninclude costs related to certain corporate functions which support both brands. This segment reporting structure reflects the Company’s current management\nstructure, internal reporting method and financial information used in deciding how to allocate Company resources. Based upon certain quantitative thresholds,\neach operating segment is considered a reportable segment. This change to our segment reporting did not change our reporting units for goodwill.\nThe Company measures and evaluates our segments based on segment revenues and segment profit. The reportable segments do not include an allocation of\nthe costs related to shared service functions, such as accounting/finance, human resources, audit services, legal, tax and treasury; nor do they include certain\nunallocated costs such share-based compensation. These costs are reflected in the caption “Shared services and unallocated costs.”\nOur measure of segment profit excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) gains, net of\nchanges in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies, acquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives, losses (gains) on\nthe sale of company-operated restaurants, gains on acquisition of restaurants, and amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net.\n15\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

INCOME TAXES\nUnder GAAP, the Company ordinarily calculates its provision for income taxes at the end of each interim reporting period by computing an estimated annual\neffective tax rate adjusted for tax items that are discrete to each period. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company calculated its interim tax\nprovision based on actual year-to-date results because small changes in forecasted pre-tax book income led to large differences in the estimated annual effective\ntax rate.\nFor the third quarter and year-to-date of fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $0.1 million and $23.3 million, respectively,\nresulting in effective tax rates of negative 0.1% and negative 66.0%, respectively. The effective tax rates for such periods differed from the U.S. statutory tax\nrate primarily due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill partially offset by the reversal of state deferred tax liabilities on basis difference of investments\nin subsidiaries and non-taxable gains from the market performance of insurance products used to fund certain non-qualified retirement plans.\nFor the third quarter and year-to-date of fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $14.1 million and $47.7 million, respectively,\nresulting in effective tax rates of 32.6% and 30.4%, respectively. The effective tax rates for such periods differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due\nto the impact of estimated disposals of non-deductible goodwill attributable to refranchising transactions partially offset by non-taxable gains from the market\nperformance of insurance products used to fund certain non-qualified retirement plans.\n11. RETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined benefit pension plans — The Company sponsors two defined benefit pension plans, a frozen “Qualified Plan” covering substantially all full-time\nemployees hired prior to January 1, 2011, and an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) which provides certain employees additional\npension benefits and was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2007. Benefits under both plans are based on the employee’s years of service and\ncompensation over defined periods of employment.\n16\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nPost-retirement healthcare plans — The Company also sponsors two healthcare plans, closed to new participants, that provide post-retirement medical\nbenefits to certain employees who have met minimum age and service requirements. The plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually,\nand they contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit) — The components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) in each period were as follows (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nDefined benefit pension plans:\nInterest cost $ 4,380 $ 4,434 $ 14,599 $ 14,782\nExpected return on plan assets (3,457) (3,486) (11,524) (11,619)\nActuarial losses (1) 701 708 2,335 2,359\nAmortization of unrecognized prior service costs (1) 3 5 11 15\nNet periodic benefit cost $ 1,627 $ 1,661 $ 5,421 $ 5,537\nPost-retirement healthcare plans:\nInterest cost $ 164 $ 162 $ 547 $ 539\nActuarial gains (1) (211) (215) (703) (717)\nNet periodic benefit credit $ (47) $ (53) $ (156) $ (178)\n____________________________\n(1) Amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net earnings as a component of “Other pension and post-retirement expenses, net.”\nFuture cash flows — The Company’s policy is to fund our plans at or above the minimum required by law. As of the date of our last actuarial funding\nvaluation, there was no minimum contribution funding requirement for the Qualified Plan. Details regarding 2024 contributions are as follows (in thousands):\nPost-Retirement\nSERP Healthcare Plans\nNet year-to-date contributions $ 3,930 $ 854\nRemaining estimated net contributions during fiscal 2024 $ 1,208 $ 251\nThe Company continues to evaluate contributions to our Qualified Plan based on changes in pension assets as a result of asset performance in the current\nmarket and the economic environment.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal matters — The Company assesses contingencies, including litigation contingencies, to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for\npotential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of July 7, 2024, the Company had accruals of $16.0 million for all of its legal matters in\naggregate, presented within “Accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing contingencies is\nhighly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate\ndue to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance coverage related to the\nclaim or claims in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the\nmatter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not\nmeaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals\nand related disclosures. The ultimate amount of loss may differ from these estimates. Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the\nCompany’s maximum possible loss exposure and the ultimate amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates in the near term.\nGessele v. Jack in the Box Inc. — In August 2010, five former Jack in the Box employees instituted litigation in federal court in Oregon alleging claims under\nthe federal Fair Labor Standards Act and Oregon wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs alleged that Jack in the Box failed to pay non-exempt employees for\ncertain meal breaks and improperly made payroll deductions for shoe purchases and for workers’ compensation expenses, and later added additional claims\nrelating to timing of final pay and related wage and hour claims involving employees of a franchisee. In 2016, the court dismissed the federal claims and those\nrelating to franchise employees. In June 2017, the court granted class certification with respect to state law claims of improper deductions and late payment of\nfinal wages. The parties participated in a voluntary mediation on March 16, 2020, but the matter did not settle. On October 24, 2022, a jury awarded plaintiffs\napproximately $6.4 million in damages and penalties. The Company continues to dispute liability and the damage award and both parties have filed appeals of\nthe verdict. As of July 7, 2024, the Company has accrued the verdict amount above, as well as estimated prejudgment and post-judgment interest and fee\naward, for an additional $9.1 million. These amounts are included within “Accrued liabilities” on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company will\ncontinue to accrue for post-judgment interest until the matter is resolved.\nTorrez — In March 2014, a former Del Taco employee filed a purported Private Attorneys General Act claim and class action alleging various causes of action\nunder California’s labor, wage, and hour laws. The plaintiff generally alleges Del Taco did not appropriately provide meal and rest breaks and failed to pay\nwages and reimburse business expenses to its California non-exempt employees. On November 12, 2021, the court granted, in part, the plaintiff's motion for\nclass certification. The parties participated in voluntary mediation on May 24, 2022 and June 3, 2022. On June 4, 2022, we entered into a Settlement\nMemorandum of Understanding which obligated the Company to pay a gross settlement amount of $50.0 million, for which in exchange we will be released\nfrom all claims by the parties. On August 8, 2023, the court issued its final approval of the settlement and on August 9, 2023 final judgement was entered. The\nCompany made its first payment of half of the settlement amount on August 28, 2023. Payment of the second half was made on November 27, 2023. As of\nJuly 7, 2024, the Company does not have any further amounts accrued on our condensed consolidated balance sheet for this matter.\n18\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nJ&D Restaurant Group — On April 17, 2019, the trustee for a bankrupt former franchisee filed a complaint generally alleging the Company wrongfully\nterminated the franchise agreements and unreasonably denied two perspective purchasers the former franchisee presented. The parties participated in a\nmediation in April 2021, and again in December 2022, but the matter did not settle. The trial commenced on January 9, 2023 and on February 8, 2023, the jury\nreturned a verdict finding the Company had not breached any contracts in terminating the franchise agreements or denying the proposed buyers. However,\nwhile the jury also found the Company had not violated the California Unfair Practices Act, it found for the plaintiff on the claim for breach of implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and awarded $8.0 million in damages. On May 9, 2023, the court granted the Company’s post-trial motion, overturning\nthe jury verdict and ordering the plaintiff take nothing on its claims. As a result, the Company reversed the prior $8.0 million accrual, and as of July 7, 2024,\nthe Company has no amounts accrued for this case on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Plaintiff has appealed the trial court’s post-trial rulings.\nOther legal matters — In addition to the matters described above, we are subject to normal and routine litigation brought by former or current employees,\ncustomers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders, or others. We intend to defend ourselves in any such matters. Some of these matters may be covered,\nat least in part, by insurance or other third-party indemnity obligation. We record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be\nprobable.\nLease guarantees — We remain contingently liable for certain leases relating to our former Qdoba business which we sold in fiscal 2018. Under the Qdoba\nPurchase Agreement, the buyer has indemnified the Company of all claims related to these guarantees. As of July 7, 2024, the maximum potential liability of\nfuture undiscounted payments under these leases is approximately $20.9 million. The lease terms extend for a maximum of approximately 14 more years and\nwe would remain a guarantor of the leases in the event the leases are extended for any established renewal periods. In the event of default, we believe the\nexposure is limited due to contractual protections and recourse available in the lease agreements, as well as the Qdoba Purchase Agreement, including a\nrequirement of the landlord to mitigate damages by re-letting the properties in default, and indemnity from the Buyer. The Company has not recorded a liability\nfor these guarantees as we believe the likelihood of making any future payments is remote.\n15.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal year ending the\nTuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s fiscal 2024 results\ninclude two fewer days. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 include 52 weeks. Our first quarter includes 16 weeks and all other quarters include 12 weeks. All\ncomparisons between 2024 and 2023 refer to the 12 weeks (“quarter”) and 40 weeks (“year-to-date”) ended July 7, 2024 and July 9, 2023, respectively, unless\notherwise indicated.\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during 2024 and 2023, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes included in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nOur MD&A consists of the following sections:\n• Overview — a general description of our business.\n• Results of operations — an analysis of our condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the periods presented in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n• Liquidity and capital resources — an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, share repurchase activity, dividends, and known\ntrends that may impact liquidity.\n• Discussion of critical accounting estimates — a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n• New accounting pronouncements — a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation and the impact on our consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations, if any.\n• Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements — a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from any forward-looking statements made by management.\nWe have included in our MD&A certain performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance and which we believe will be useful\nin analyzing and understanding our results of operations. These metrics include:\n• Changes in sales at restaurants open more than one year (“same-store sales”), systemwide sales, franchised restaurant sales, and average unit volumes\n(“AUVs”). Same-store sales, restaurant sales, and AUVs are presented for franchised restaurants and on a system-wide basis, which includes company\nand franchise restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at franchise restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales\nas revenues; however, our royalty revenues, marketing fees and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. We\nbelieve franchise and system same-store sales, franchised and system restaurant sales, and AUV information are useful to investors as they have a\ndirect effect on the Company’s profitability.\nSame-store sales, systemwide sales, franchised restaurant sales, and AUVs are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be\nconsidered in isolation, or as an alternative to earnings from operations, or other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nFounded in 1951, Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”) operates and franchises Jack in the Box® and Del Taco® quick-service restaurants. As of July 7,\n2024, we operated and franchised 2,195 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western and southern United States, including two in Guam,\nand 597 Del Taco quick-service restaurants across 17 states.\nWe derive revenue from retail sales at company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties (based upon a percent of sales), franchise fees and\ncontributions for advertising and other services from franchisees.\n21\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables summarize changes in same-store sales for Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated, franchised, and system restaurants:\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCompany 0.1 % 6.9 % 0.6 % 10.3 %\nFranchise (2.4 %) 8.0 % (1.3 %) 8.2 %\nSystem (2.2 %) 7.9 % (1.1 %) 8.4 %\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 10,\nDel Taco: 2024 2023 2024 2022 (1)\nCompany (3.5 %) 1.7 % (0.9 %) 2.8 %\nFranchise (4.1 %) 1.8 % (0.7 %) 2.5 %\nSystem (3.9 %) 1.7 % (0.8 %) 2.6 %\nThe following tables summarize year-to-date changes in the number and mix of company and franchise restaurants for our two brands:\n2024 2023\nJack in the Box: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 142 2,044 2,186 146 2,035 2,181\nNew 2 11 13 — 14 14\nRefranchised — — — (5) 5 —\nClosed — (4) (4) (1) (3) (4)\nEnd of period 144 2,051 2,195 140 2,051 2,191\n% of system 7 % 93 % 100 % 6 % 94 % 100 %\n2024 2023\nDel Taco: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 171 421 592 290 301 591\nNew 2 10 12 — 7 7\nAcquired from franchisees 9 (9) — — — —\nRefranchised (13) 13 — (66) 66 —\nClosed (4) (3) (7) (3) (1) (4)\nEnd of period 165 432 597 221 373 594\n% of system 28 % 72 % 100 % 37 % 63 % 100 %\n22\nThe following tables summarize restaurant sales for company-operated, franchised, and systemwide sales for our two brands (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 100,355 $ 96,820 $ 331,339 $ 318,451\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 931,303 948,457 3,069,318 3,088,697\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 1,031,658 $ 1,045,277 $ 3,400,657 $ 3,407,148\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\nDel Taco: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 66,125 $ 101,696 $ 226,279 $ 352,860\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 157,231 129,112 510,561 394,105\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 223,356 $ 230,808 $ 736,840 $ 746,965\n____________________________\n(1) Franchised restaurant sales represent sales at franchised restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees.

The greatest impacts were seen in poultry and beef in the quarter, and beef, produce\nand poultry, on a year-to-date basis.\nPayroll and employee benefit costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 2.0% in the quarter and 0.4% year-to-date compared to the prior\nyear. During the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, increases in wage inflation and group insurance were offset by decreases in incentive compensation. Labor\ninflation was approximately 14.9% in the quarter and 6.9% year-to-date for the current year.\nOccupancy and other costs, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased 0.9% in the quarter and 0.4% year-to-date compared to the prior year.\nFor the quarter, these increases were primarily due to higher utilities and insurance costs. For the year-to-date period, these increases were primarily due to\nhigher security costs, other operating costs, partially offset by lower maintenance and repair costs.\n24\nJack in the Box Franchise Operations\nThe following table presents franchise revenues and costs in each period and other information we believe is useful in analyzing the change in franchise\noperating results (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFranchise rental revenues $ 82,154 $ 83,271 $ 267,350 $ 270,277\nRoyalties 46,490 47,373 153,227 161,343\nFranchise fees and other 1,332 1,388 5,475 4,855\nFranchise royalties and other 47,822 48,761 158,702 166,198\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services 51,419 51,360 168,960 167,034\nTotal franchise revenues $ 181,395 $ 183,392 $ 595,012 $ 603,509\nFranchise occupancy expenses $ 51,055 $ 51,013 $ 167,092 $ 165,575\nFranchise support and other costs 2,894 3,526 9,399 7,084\nFranchise advertising and other services expenses 52,810 53,519 174,706 174,730\nTotal franchise costs $ 106,759 $ 108,058 $ 351,197 $ 347,389\nFranchise costs as a percentage of total franchise revenues 58.9% 58.9% 59.0% 57.6%\nAverage number of franchise restaurants 2,036 2,035 2,037 2,035\n% increase —% 0.1%\nFranchised restaurant sales $ 931,303 $ 948,457 $ 3,069,318 $ 3,088,697\nFranchised restaurant AUVs $ 457 $ 466 $ 1,507 $ 1,518\nRoyalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales (1) 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 5.2%\n____________________________\n(1) Excluding the impact of the $7.3 million termination fee in the first quarter of 2023 royalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales would be 5.0%.\nFranchise rental revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 1.3% in the quarter and $2.9 million, or 1.1% year-to-date, compared to the prior year primarily due to\nlower percentage rent of $2.7 million in the quarter and $6.2 million year-to-date, respectively, driven by lower franchise restaurant sales. These decreases were\npartially offset by increases in minimum rent of $0.9 million and $2.7 million, in the respective periods, as well as an increase of $1.3 million and $1.3 million,\nrelated to lease terminations, respectively.\nFranchise royalties and other decreased $0.9 million, or 1.9% in the quarter and $7.5 million, or 4.5% year-to-date. In the quarter, the decrease was\nprimarily due to lower royalty income of $0.9 million driven by lower sales. The year-to-date decrease was primarily due to a $7.3 million termination fee paid\nin the prior year by a franchise operator to sell his restaurants to a new franchisee, partially offset by an increase in franchise early termination fees in the\ncurrent year. Refer also to Note 2, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services revenues increased $0.1 million, or 0.1% in the quarter and $1.9 million, or 1.2% year-to-date, as\ncompared to the prior year. The increase in the quarter is primarily due to an increase in digital and technology fees of $0.9 million offset by lower marketing\ncontribution of $0.9 million, driven by lower franchise restaurant sales. On a year-to-date basis, the increase is primarily due to the increase in digital and\ntechnology fees of $2.7 million offset by lower marketing contribution of $1.1 million.\nFranchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased less than $0.1 million, or 0.1% in the quarter and $1.5 million, or 0.9% year-to-date compared to\nthe prior year primarily due to an increase in operating lease costs in the current year.\nFranchise support and other costs decreased $0.6 million, or 17.9% in the quarter, and increased $2.3 million, or 32.7% year-to-date compared to the prior\nyear. Year-to-date, the increase is primarily due to the rollover of a bad debt reversal in the prior year.\n25\nFranchise advertising and other service expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 1.3% in the quarter and was essentially flat year-to-date compared to the prior\nyear. In the quarter, the decrease is primarily driven by lower franchise marketing expense due to lower sales, partially offset by higher costs for digital\nprocessing fees. On a year-to-date basis, the decrease from lower sales driving lower marketing expenses was offset by higher franchise IT revenue costs as\nwell as higher costs for digital processing fees.\nDel Taco Brand\nCompany Restaurant Operations\nThe following table presents company restaurant sales and costs as a percentage of the related sales (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, 2024 July 9, 2023 July 7, 2024 July 9, 2023\nCompany restaurant sales $ 66,125 $ 101,696 $ 226,279 $ 352,860\nCompany restaurant costs:\nFood and packaging $ 16,898 25.6 % $ 28,171 27.7 % $ 59,198 26.2 % $ 98,247 27.8 %\nPayroll and employee benefits $ 25,495 38.6 % $ 34,579 34.0 % $ 81,621 36.1 % $ 119,617 33.9 %\nOccupancy and other $ 14,901 22.5 % $ 21,254 20.9 % $ 50,832 22.5 % $ 75,523 21.4 %\nCompany restaurant sales decreased $35.6 million or 35.0% in the quarter and $126.6 million or 35.9% year-to-date compared to the prior year. These\ndecreases were primarily due to the refranchising of 58 company-operated restaurants and the closing of 10 company-operated restaurants since the third\nquarter of 2023 and decreases in same store sales, for both the quarter and year-to-date compared to the prior year.

The following\ntable summarizes the change versus a year ago:\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage check (1) 5.3 % 4.1 % 3.9 % 6.7 %\nTransactions (8.8 %) (2.4 %) (4.8 %) (3.9 %)\nChange in same-store sales (3.5 %) 1.7 % (0.9 %) 2.8 %\n________________________\n(1) Includes price increases of approximately 8.0% in the quarter and 7.0% year-to-date.\nFood and packaging costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 2.1% in the quarter and 1.6% year-to-date, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to menu price increases and the change in mix of restaurants resulting from company restaurant refranchising, partially offset by commodity\ninflation.\nCommodity costs inflation was 0.2% in the quarter and deflation of 0.5% year-to-date. The greatest impact on the quarter inflation was seen in produce\nand dairy, and the greatest impact on the year-to-date deflation was in cheese and pork.\nPayroll and employee benefit costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 4.6% in the quarter and 2.2% year-to-date, compared to the prior\nyear primarily due to labor inflation, which was 17.7% in the quarter and 7.9% year-to-date.\nOccupancy and other costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales increased 1.6% in the quarter and 1.1% year-to-date, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to higher utilities and increased information technology costs.\n26\nDel Taco Franchise Operations\nThe following table presents franchise revenues and costs in each period and other information we believe is useful in analyzing the change in franchise\noperating results (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFranchise rental revenues $ 6,971 $ 2,977 $ 20,797 $ 8,321\nRoyalties 7,287 6,129 24,055 18,721\nFranchise fees and other 184 79 950 422\nFranchise royalties and other 7,471 6,208 25,005 19,143\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services 6,854 5,849 23,583 17,497\nTotal franchise revenues $ 21,296 $ 15,034 $ 69,385 $ 44,961\nFranchise occupancy expenses $ 6,934 $ 2,918 $ 20,612 $ 8,228\nFranchise support and other costs 959 553 3,508 1,540\nFranchise advertising and other services expenses 7,634 6,050 25,495 18,145\nTotal franchise costs $ 15,527 $ 9,521 $ 49,615 $ 27,913\nFranchise costs as a percentage of total franchise revenues 72.9% 63.3% 71.5% 62.1%\nAverage number of franchise restaurants 429 373 421 373\n% increase 15.0% 12.9%\nFranchised restaurant sales $ 157,231 $ 129,112 $ 510,561 $ 394,105\nFranchised restaurant AUVs $ 367 $ 346 $ 1,213 $ 1,057\nRoyalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales 4.6% 4.7% 4.7% 4.8%\nFranchise rental revenues increased $4.0 million, or 134.2%, in the quarter and $12.5 million, or 149.9% year-to-date, compared to the prior year. The\nincrease is primarily due to higher rental income resulting from new subleases related to the 58 restaurants refranchised since the third quarter of 2023.\nFranchise royalties and other increased $1.3 million, or 20.3%, in the quarter and $5.9 million, or 30.6% year-to-date, compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to royalties from the higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 58 restaurants refranchised and the 17 franchise-operated restaurants opened since\nthe third quarter of 2023.\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services revenues increased $1.0 million, or 17.2%, in the quarter and $6.1 million, or 34.8% year-to-\ndate, compared to the prior year primarily due to higher marketing contributions related to higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 58 restaurants\nrefranchised and the 17 franchise-operated restaurants opened since the third quarter of 2023.\nFranchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased $4.0 million, or 137.6%, in the quarter and $12.4 million, or 150.5% year-to-date, compared to\nthe prior year primarily due to higher rent related to franchise subleases for the 58 restaurants refranchised since the third quarter of 2023.\nFranchise support and other costs increased $0.4 million, or 73.4%, in the quarter and $2.0 million, or 127.8% year-to-date, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to higher franchise development support costs in each period, as well as additional overhead costs on a year-to-date basis.\nFranchise advertising and other service expenses increased $1.6 million, or 26.2%, in the quarter and $7.4 million, or 40.5% year-to-date, compared to the\nprior year primarily due to higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 58 restaurants refranchised and the 17 franchise-operated restaurants opened\nsince the third quarter of 2023.\n27\nCompany-Wide Results\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the quarter ended July 7, 2024 decreased $0.6 million in the quarter and $2.3 million year-to-date compared to the prior\nyear period. The decreases in depreciation are primarily due to the refranchising of Del Taco restaurants since the prior year, as well as certain Jack in the Box\nfranchise assets becoming fully depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by increases for new technology assets and new company restaurant\nopenings.\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses\nThe following table presents the amounts for SG&A expenses in each period (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAdvertising $ 8,267 $ 8,996 $ 26,438 $ 30,308\nShare-based compensation 2,357 2,058 11,018 7,991\nCash surrender value of COLI policies, net (3,223) (579) (9,289) (7,147)\nLitigation matters 518 333 1,236 5,262\nInsurance (1,149) 1,780 2,425 5,362\nOther 22,810 27,029 81,372 87,388\n$ 29,580 $ 39,617 $ 113,200 $ 129,164\nAdvertising costs represent company contributions to our marketing funds and are generally determined as a percentage of company-operated restaurant\nsales. Advertising costs decreased $0.7 million in the quarter and $3.9 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease\nin company-operated restaurant sales in the current year which was driven by Del Taco refranchising.\nShare-based compensation increased by $0.3 million in the quarter and $3.0 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year, primarily due to\nadditional restricted stock unit awards, partially offset by lower performance-based equity awards due to lower performance metrics.\nThe cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation\nsupported by these policies, are subject to market fluctuations. The changes in market values had a favorable impact of $2.6 million in the quarter and $2.1\nmillion on a year-to-date basis, compared to the prior year.\nLitigation matters increased $0.2 million in the quarter and decreased $4.0 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year primarily due to\nthe timing of litigation developments in each period, respectively. Refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements for additional information related to the legal matters.\nInsurance decreased $2.9 million in the quarter, as well as on a year-to-date basis, as compared to the prior year primarily due to the positive development\nfactors related to workers compensation and general liability claims in each period, respectively.\nGoodwill Impairment Charges\nAs of the June 9, 2024 testing date, the balance of the Del Taco reporting unit goodwill was $194.0 million. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company\nidentified triggering events that indicated the goodwill allocated to the Del Taco reporting unit might be impaired. The triggering events related to i) a recent\nnegative trend in Del Taco same store sales, ii) lower margins due in part to lower sales and wage increases required in California effective April 1, 2024 under\nAB 1228, iii) unfavorable changes in the economic environment specifically impacting our industry, including inflation and interest rates, and iv) a sustained\nlower share price. As a result, the Company performed a quantitative test over the Del Taco reporting unit, noting that the fair value of the reporting unit was\nless than the carrying value, which resulted in an impairment of goodwill of $162.6 million.\n28\nOther Operating Expenses (Income), Net\nOther operating expenses (income), net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives $ 4,723 $ 2,463 $ 14,612 $ 5,359\nCosts of closed restaurants and other 160 1,272 1,792 4,017\nOperating restaurant impairment charges 136 4,395 136 4,395\nAccelerated depreciation 95 66 485 519\nGains on acquisition of restaurants — — (2,357) —\nLosses (gains) on disposition of property and equipment, net 527 (540) 1,675 (9,155)\n$ 5,641 $ 7,656 $ 16,343 $ 5,135\nOther operating expenses (income), net decreased $2.0 million in the quarter and increased $11.2 million on a year-to-date basis, as compared to the prior\nyear. For the quarter, the decrease was primarily due to $4.4 million of impairment charges recognized for Del Taco restaurants in the prior year, partially offset\nby an increase of $2.0 million in connection with consulting fees for strategic initiatives in the current year.\nFor the year-to-date period, the increase of $11.2 million was due to $9.5 million of gains recognized in the prior year from a sale of Jack in the Box\nrestaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the properties from us prior to the sale, as well as an increase of $9.3 million of consulting fees for\nstrategic initiatives in the current year. These increases were partially offset by $4.4 million of impairment charges recognized for Del Taco restaurants last\nyear, the $2.4 million purchase gain related to the acquisition of 9 Del Taco restaurants in the current year, as well as a $2.2 million decrease in costs of closed\nrestaurants.\nGains and Losses on the Sale of Company-Operated Restaurants\nFor the fiscal 2024 year-to-date period, the Company sold 13 Del Taco company-operated restaurants to franchisees, for which the Company recognized a\nnet loss on the sale of company-operated restaurants of $1.4 million.\nFor the fiscal 2023 year-to-date period, the Company sold five Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants and 66 Del Taco company-operated\nrestaurants to franchisees, for which the Company recognized a net gain on the sale of company-operated restaurants of $10.3 million.\nRefer to Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings and Assets Held for Sale, of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding these transactions.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9, July 7, July 9,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest expense $ 18,901 $ 19,201 $ 63,261 $ 65,462\nInterest income (499) (539) (1,770) (1,295)\nInterest expense, net $ 18,402 $ 18,662 $ 61,491 $ 64,167\nInterest expense, net, decreased $0.3 million in the quarter and $2.7 million year-to-date primarily due to lower average borrowings, as well as lower\naverage interest rates, resulting in a decrease of $0.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, in interest expense compared to the prior year. Additionally, there\nwas an increase in interest income of $0.5 million year-to-date due to higher investment balances compared to fiscal year 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense\nUnder GAAP, the Company ordinarily calculates its provision for income taxes at the end of each interim reporting period by computing an estimated\nannual effective tax rate adjusted for tax items that are discrete to each period. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, the company calculated its interim tax\nprovision based on actual year-to-date results because small changes in forecasted pre-tax book income led to large differences in the estimated annual effective\ntax rate.\n29\nFor the third quarter and year-to-date of fiscal year 2024, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $0.1 million and $23.3 million, respectively,\nresulting in effective tax rates of negative 0.1% and negative 66.0%, respectively. The effective tax rates for such periods differed from the U.S. statutory tax\nrate primarily due to the impairment of non-deductible goodwill partially offset by the reversal of state deferred tax liabilities on basis difference of investments\nin subsidiaries and non-taxable gains from the market performance of insurance products used to fund certain non-qualified retirement plans.\nFor the third quarter and year-to-date of fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded income tax provisions of $14.1 million and $47.7 million, respectively,\nresulting in effective tax rates of 32.6% and 30.4%, respectively. The effective tax rates for such periods differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due\nto the impact of estimated disposals of non-deductible goodwill attributable to refranchising transactions partially offset by non-taxable gains from the market\nperformance of insurance products used to fund certain non-qualified retirement plans.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit\nfacilities. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service\nrequirements, franchise tenant improvement allowance and incentive distributions, dividend payments, and obligations related to our benefit plans. We\ngenerally use available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common\nstock.\nAs of July 7, 2024, the Company had $50.8 million of cash and restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheet and available borrowings of $175.5\nmillion under our $150.0 million Variable Funding Notes and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company continually assesses the optimal sources\nand uses of cash for our business. We review our balance sheet for any undervalued assets and pursue opportunities for capital sources, including the sale of our\nowned Jack in the Box properties and refranchising, primarily for Del Taco in the near term.\nBased upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing\nfacility and revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve\nmonths and the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9,\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 39,263 $ 182,071\nInvesting activities (68,288) 25,488\nFinancing activities (106,124) (161,579)\nNet cash flows $ (135,149) $ 45,980\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flows decreased $142.8 million compared with a year ago. This is primarily due to an unfavorable change in\nworking capital of $138.0 million, as well as lower net income, when adjusted for non-cash items, of $4.8 million. The change in working capital is primarily a\nresult of the decrease of $58.2 million of income tax liabilities (of which $50.3 million was a payment deferred from 2023 in connection with the Southern\nCalifornia winter storm disaster area declaration), a decrease in accrued legal of $29.8 million (of which $25.5 million is due to the final payment of the Torrez\nlitigation), a decrease in the advertising accruals of $14.9 million due to timing, and a decrease in payroll and related taxes accrual of $13.6 million due to\ncompany-operated restaurant refranchising activity.\nInvesting Activities. Cash flows from investing activities decreased by $93.8 million compared with a year ago primarily due to higher purchases of\nproperty and equipment of $29.1 million in the current year, lower proceeds from the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees of $14.3\nmillion in the current year, and lower proceeds from the sale of company-operated restaurants of $49.7 million.\n30\nCapital Expenditures — The composition of capital expenditures in each period follows (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9,\n2024 2023\nRestaurants:\nRemodel / refresh programs $ 8,728 $ 6,222\nRestaurant facility expenditures 30,787 21,924\nPurchases of assets intended for sale 18,584 13,241\nPurchase of land 2,144 —\nRestaurant information technology 18,794 10,463\n79,037 51,850\nCorporate Services:\nInformation technology 6,313 4,559\nCorporate facilities 418 260\n6,731 4,819\nTotal capital expenditures $ 85,768 $ 56,669\nThe increase in restaurant facility expenditures includes amounts spent on capital maintenance and other operational initiatives. The increase for the\npurchases of assets intended for sale includes amounts spent on exercising our right of first refusal to purchase land and building which we intend to sell to\nfranchisees and/or sell and leaseback. The increase for corporate information technology includes spending in connection with our new enterprise resource\nplanning system and digital workflow platform.\nSale of Company-Operated Restaurants — The following table details proceeds received in connection with our refranchising activities in each period\n(dollars in thousands).\nYear-to-date\nJuly 7, July 9,\n2024 2023\nNumber of Jack in the Box restaurants sold to franchisees — 5\nNumber of Del Taco restaurants sold to franchisees 13 66\nTotal proceeds $ 2,168 $ 51,845\nFor further information, see Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings and Assets Held for Sale, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFinancing Activities. Cash flows from financing activities decreased by $55.5 million compared with a year ago. The change is primarily due to the $50.0\nmillion repayment in the prior year on the Variable Funding Notes and the $5.4 million decrease in stock repurchases in the current year versus the prior year.\nRepurchases of common stock — The Company repurchased 0.8 million shares of its common stock in fiscal 2024 for an aggregate cost of $55.4 million.\nAs of July 7, 2024, there was $195.0 million remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors which do not expire.\nDividends — Up through July 7, 2024, the Board of Directors declared three cash dividends of $0.44 per common share totaling $25.8 million.\nOn August 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share, to be paid on September 19, 2024, to shareholders of record as of\nthe close of business on August 30, 2024.\nSecuritized Refinancing Transaction — On February 11, 2022, the Company completed the sale of $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 3.445% Fixed Rate\nSenior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) and $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 4.136% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II\n(the “Class A-2-II Notes” and, together with the Class A-2-I Notes, the “2022 Notes”). Interest payments on the 2022 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis.\nThe anticipated repayment dates of the 2022 Class A-2-I Notes and the Class A-2-II Notes will be February 2027 and February 2032, respectively, unless\nearlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the indenture that governs the 2022 Notes. The anticipated repayment dates of the existing 2019-1 Class A-2-II\nNotes and the Class A-2-III Notes are August 2026 and August 2029, respectively.\n31\nThe Company also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes (the “Variable Funding Notes”),\nwhich permits borrowings up to a maximum of $150.0 million, subject to certain borrowing conditions, a portion of which may be used to issue letters of\ncredit. As of July 7, 2024, we did not have any outstanding borrowings and had available borrowing capacity of $100.5 million under our Variable Funding\nNotes, net of letters of credits issued of $49.5 million.\nThe 2022 Notes were issued in a privately placed securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s revenue-generating assets,\nconsisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are\nheld by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as Guarantors of\nthe Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Notes. The\n2022 Notes are subject to the same covenants and restrictions as the Series 2019-1 Notes.\nThe quarterly principal payment on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding\nthe leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. Subsequent to closing the issuance of the 2022 Notes, the Company has\nhad a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on its 2022 Notes and Series\n2019-1 Notes beginning in the second quarter of 2022.\nRestricted cash — In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, certain cash accounts have been established with the Indenture trustee for the benefit of\nthe note holders and are restricted in their use. As of July 7, 2024, the Company had restricted cash of $29.1 million, which primarily represented cash\ncollections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of interest and commitment fees required for the Class A-1 and A-2 Notes.\nCovenants and restrictions — The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the\nMaster Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and\nmandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under\ncertain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways\ndefective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid\namortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of gross sales for\nspecified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay\nor refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events\nrelating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain\ntime frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.\nAs of July 7, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenant requirements and were not subject to any rapid amortization events.\nRevolving credit facility — In connection with the Del Taco acquisition, Del Taco’s existing debt related to a Syndicated Credit Facility dated August 5,\n2015, was repaid and extinguished on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Del Taco entered into a new syndicated credit facility with an aggregate principal\namount of up to $75.0 million, which was extended and now matures on February 28, 2025. The revolving credit facility, as amended, includes a limit of\n$20.0 million for letters of credit, all of which were cancelled as of October 1, 2023. As of July 7, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and available\nborrowing capacity of $75.0 million under the facility.\nDISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are most important for the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results,\nand that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in\nmaterially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to the critical\naccounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.\n32\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

As a\nresult, the Company’s stockholders could lose confidence in our financial results, which would harm our business and the value of the Company’s\ncommon shares.\n• Changes in tax laws, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities could adversely affect our income tax expense\nand income tax payments.\n• We may be subject to risk associated with disagreements with key stakeholders, such as franchisees.\n• Actions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management’s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on\nour business.\n• We are subject to the risk of cybersecurity breaches, intrusions, data loss, or other data security incidents.\n• We are subject to risks associated with our increasing dependence on digital commerce platforms and technologies to maintain and grow sales, and we\ncannot predict the impact that these digital commerce platforms and technologies, other new or improved technologies or alternative methods of\ndelivery may have on consumer behavior and our financial results.\n• We are dependent on information technology and digital service providers and any material failure, misuse or interruption of our computer systems,\nsupporting infrastructure, consumer-facing digital capabilities or social media platforms could adversely affect our business.\n• The securitized debt instruments issued by certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms, and any failure to comply with such terms\ncould result in default, which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business.\n• We have a significant amount of debt outstanding. Such indebtedness, along with the other contractual commitments of our Company or its\nsubsidiaries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to\nmeet debt payment obligations.\n• The securitization transaction documents impose certain restrictions on our activities or the activities of our subsidiaries, and the failure to comply\nwith such restrictions could adversely affect our business.\n• The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our business, which has affected and could continue to materially affect our\noperations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese and other factors are identified and described in more detail in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited\nto: the “Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates,” and other sections in this Form 10-Q and the “Risk Factors” section of our most recent Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (“Form 10-K”). These documents may be read free of charge on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.\nPotential investors are urged to consider these factors, more fully described in our Form 10-K, carefully in evaluating any forward-looking statements, and are\ncautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date issued, and we do not\nundertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n34\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThere have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative market risks set forth in Part II, Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nAbout Market Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, as amended), as of the end of the Company’s quarter ended July 7, 2024, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively) have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the quarter ended July 7, 2024, we implemented a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The new ERP system replaced legacy systems\nin which a significant portion of our business transactions originated, were processed, or were recorded. Additionally, we converted certain boundary\napplications for Del Taco so that they would interface with the new ERP system. The new ERP system is intended to provide us with enhanced transactional\nprocessing, security and management tools and is an important component of our system of disclosure controls and procedures.\nThere have been no other changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended\nJuly 7, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n35\nPART II. OTHER INFORMATION\nThere is no information required to be reported for any items under Part II, except as follows:\nITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nSee Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our contingencies and\nlegal matters.\nITEM 1A.

You should also\nconsider the risks and uncertainties discussed under the heading “Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 2 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended October 1, 2023, including our financial statements and the related notes. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. Additional\nrisks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the risks or\nuncertainties actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\nStock Repurchases — In the third quarter of 2024, we repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $15.1 million,\nincluding the applicable excise tax.

Reports Second Quarter 2024 Earnings\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\n**Jack in the Box same-store sales of (2.5%); Del Taco same-store sales of (1.4%)**\n\n**Jack in the Box systemwide sales of (1.6%); Del Taco systemwide sales of (1.3%)**\n\n**Diluted EPS of $1.26; Operating EPS of $1.46**\n\n**Jack in the Box restaurant level margin of 23.6%, up 2.2% from prior year**\n\n**Jack in the Box signed franchise development agreements in Q2 to enter Tallahassee and expand in Orlando; now has 31 restaurant commitments in Florida**\n\n**Del Taco signed franchisee development agreements in Q2 for 3 restaurants to enter Greensboro, NC, and 10 additional restaurants in Atlanta**\n\n**Jack in the Box new-market restaurants opened in the past 12 months, which now includes Mexico, averaging almost $100k weekly AUV**\n\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  **Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ: JACK)** announced financial results for the Jack in the Box and Del Taco brands in the second quarter, ended April 14, 2024. \n\n\"I am proud of the execution by our Jack and Del Taco teams, delivering better-than-expected earnings and margin performance while navigating through increasing macro headwinds, pressure on low-income consumers and the implementation of California's minimum wage legislation,\" said Darin Harris, Jack in the Box Chief Executive Officer. \"Top-line performance was impacted by the shift in consumer behavior and an unexpected delay in our Smashed Jack launch, but sales have improved since its introduction in mid-March. We have a clear plan to regain same store sales traction through a strong marketing calendar, new LTO's, and an expanded value menu throughout the remainder of 2024. I remain confident in our long-term strategy to drive sales, margin expansion, and new unit and market openings — as do our franchisees, who continue to grow our development pipeline and invest in the expansion of our brands.\" \n\n** Jack in the Box Performance **\n\nSame-store sales decreased 2.5% in the second quarter, comprised of franchise same-store sales decline of 2.6% and company-owned same-store sales decline of 0.6%. Both franchise and company-owned restaurants experienced declines in transactions, partially offset by a lift in average check. Systemwide sales for the second quarter decreased 1.6%. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $23.3 million, or 23.6%, up from $20.4 million, or 21.4%, a year ago driven primarily by additional company-owned restaurants and commodity deflation. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $71.7 million, or 40.4%, a decrease from $73.9 million, or 41.2%, a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by the decline in sales for the quarter and the resulting decrease in rent and royalty revenue. \n\nJack in the Box net restaurant count increased in the second quarter, with three restaurant openings and no restaurant closures. As of the second quarter, and since the launch of the development program in mid-2021, the company currently has 93 signed agreements for a total of 409 restaurants. Under these agreements, 44 restaurants have opened, leaving 365 remaining for future development. \n\n**Jack in the Box Same-Store Sales:** |  **12 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**April 14, 2024** |  **April 16, 2023**  \nCompany  |  (0.6  |  %)  |  10.8  |  %   \nFranchise  |  (2.6  |  %)  |  9.4  |  %   \nSystem  |  (2.5  |  %)  |  9.5  |  %   \n  \n**Jack in the Box Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nRestaurant count at Q1'24  |  144  |  2,048  |  2,192  |  140  |  2,046  |  2,186   \nNew  |  —  |  3  |  3  |  —  |  2  |  2   \nClosed  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (1  |  )  |  (1  |  )   \nRestaurant count at end of Q2'24  |  144  |  2,051  |  2,195  |  140  |  2,047  |  2,187   \nQ2 Net Restaurant Increase  |  —  |  3  |  3   \nYTD Net Restaurant Increase  |  1.4  |  %  |  0.3  |  %  |  0.4  |  %   \n  \n** Del Taco Performance **\n\nSame-store sales decreased 1.4% in the second quarter, comprised of franchise same-store sales decline of 1.1% and company-operated same-store sales decline of 1.8%. Sales performance included declines in transactions, partially offset by a lift in average check. Systemwide sales for the fiscal second quarter decreased 1.3%. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $11.4 million, or 16.8%, down from $18.5 million, or 17.3%, a year ago. The decrease in margin dollars was due mainly to refranchising restaurants, while the decrease in margin percentage was due to increased costs for labor and utilities, partially offset by price increases and commodity deflation. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $6.1 million, or 28.9%, compared to $5.1 million, or 37.3%, a year ago. The decrease in margin percentage was driven by the impact of a higher franchise mix and the impact of the pass-thru rent and marketing fees. \n\nDel Taco expanded the restaurant count in the second quarter, with three restaurant openings and no restaurant closings. \n\n**Del Taco Same-Store Sales:** |  **12 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**April 14, 2024** |  **April 16, 2023**  \nCompany  |  (1.8  |  %)  |  3.5  |  %   \nFranchise  |  (1.1  |  %)  |  2.8  |  %   \nSystem  |  (1.4  |  %)  |  3.2  |  %   \n  \n**Del Taco Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nRestaurant count at Q4'23  |  179  |  413  |  592  |  273  |  319  |  592   \nNew  |  —  |  3  |  3  |  —  |  3  |  3   \nRefranchised  |  (13  |  )  |  13  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nRestaurant count at end of Q2  |  166  |  429  |  595  |  273  |  322  |  595   \nQ2 Net Restaurant Increase/(Decrease)  |  (13  |  )  |  16  |  3   \nYTD Net Restaurant Increase/(Decrease)  |  (2.9  |  )%  |  1.9  |  %  |  0.5  |  %   \n  \n** Company-Wide Performance **\n\nSecond quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.26. Operating Earnings Per Share(2), a non-GAAP measure, was $1.46 in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $1.47 in the prior year quarter. \n\nTotal revenues decreased 7.7% to $365.3 million, compared to $395.7 million in the prior year quarter. The lower revenue is primarily the result of the Del Taco refranchising efforts. Net earnings was $25.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with $26.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(3), a non-GAAP measure, was $75.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $80.6 million for the prior year quarter. \n\nCompany-wide SG&A expense for the second quarter was $37.5 million, a decrease of $1.9 million compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due primarily to lower incentive-based compensation and lower advertising due to fewer company-owned restaurants, partially offset by higher share-based compensation, legal and technology costs. When excluding net COLI gains, G&A was 2.5% of systemwide sales. \n\nThe income tax provisions reflect an effective tax rate of 26.5% in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to 34.8% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. The Non-GAAP Operating EPS tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 27.1%. \n\n(1) Restaurant-Level Margin and Franchise-Level Margin are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to earnings from operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the attachment to this release. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.\" (2) Operating Earnings Per Share represents the diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, excluding certain adjustments. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.\" Operating earnings per share may not add due to rounding. (3) Adjusted EBITDA represents net earnings on a GAAP basis excluding certain adjustments. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.\" \n\n** Capital Allocation **\n\nThe Company repurchased 0.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $15.0 million in the second quarter.

AND SUBSIDIARIES** **RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS TO GAAP RESULTS** **(Unaudited)**\n\nTo supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted Net Income, Operating Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level Margin and Franchise-Level Margin. Management believes that these measurements, when viewed with the company's results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations in the tables below, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period changes, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the company's core business without regard to potential distortions. \n\n**_Operating Earnings Per Share_ **\n\nOperating Earnings Per Share represents diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis excluding acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives, net COLI gains, pension and post-retirement benefit costs, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, excess tax (benefits) shortfall from share-based compensation arrangements, and the tax-related impacts of the above adjustments. \n\nOperating Earnings Per Share should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management believes Operating Earnings Per Share provides investors with a meaningful supplement of the company’s operating performance and period-over-period changes without regard to potential distortions. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income. Also below is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Operating Earnings Per Share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted earnings per share: \n\n**12 Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**April 14, 2024** |  **April 16, 2023**  \nNet income, as reported  |  $  |  24,980  |  $  |  26,507   \nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives (1)  |  4,268  |  1,259   \nNet COLI gains (2)  |  (1,232  |  )  |  (844  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (3)  |  1,579  |  1,607   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants (4)  |  1,065  |  (704  |  )   \nExcess tax (benefits) shortfall from share-based compensation arrangements  |  (38  |  )  |  —   \nTax impact of adjustments (5)  |  (1,700  |  )  |  2,940   \nNon-GAAP Adjusted Net Income  |  $  |  28,922  |  $  |  30,765   \nWeighted-average shares outstanding - diluted  |  19,785  |  20,864   \nDiluted earnings per share – GAAP  |  $  |  1.26  |  $  |  1.27   \nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives (1)  |  0.22  |  0.06   \nNet COLI gains (2)  |  (0.06  |  )  |  (0.04  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (3)  |  0.08  |  0.08   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  0.05  |  (0.03  |  )   \nExcess tax (benefits) shortfall from share-based compensation arrangements  |  0.00  |  —   \nTax impact of adjustments (4)  |  (0.09  |  )  |  0.13   \nOperating Earnings Per Share – non-GAAP (5)  |  $  |  1.46  |  $  |  1.47   \n____________________   \n---  \n(1)  |  Acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives reflect charges that are not part of our ongoing operations, including consulting fees for discrete project-based strategic initiatives that are not expected to recur in the foreseeable future.   \n(2)  |  Net COLI gains reflect market-based adjustments on the company-owned life insurance policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies.   \n(3)  |  Pension and post-retirement benefit costs relating to our two legacy defined benefit pension plans, as well as our two legacy post-retirement plans.   \n(4)  |  Tax impacts for the quarter calculated based on the non-GAAP Operating EPS tax rate of 27.1% in the current quarter and 26.7% in the prior year quarter.   \n(5)  |  Operating Earnings Per Share may not add due to rounding.   \n  \n**_Adjusted EBITDA_ **\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net earnings on a GAAP basis excluding income taxes, interest expense, net, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, other operating expenses (income), net, depreciation and amortization, amortization of cloud computing costs, amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net, amortization of franchise tenant improvement allowances and other, net COLI gains, and pension and post-retirement benefit costs. \n\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company's ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net earnings (in thousands): \n\n**12 Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**April 14, 2024** |  **April 16, 2023**  \nNet earnings - GAAP  |  $  |  24,980  |  $  |  26,507   \nIncome taxes  |  9,028  |  14,168   \nInterest expense, net  |  18,603  |  19,357   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  1,065  |  (704  |  )   \nOther operating expenses (income), net (1)  |  5,267  |  2,980   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  13,906  |  14,598   \nAmortization of cloud-computing costs (2)  |  1,274  |  1,094   \nAmortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net  |  107  |  826   \nAmortization of franchise tenant improvement allowances and other  |  1,127  |  1,022   \nNet COLI gains (3)  |  (1,232  |  )  |  (844  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (4)  |  1,579  |  1,607   \nAdjusted EBITDA – non-GAAP  |  $  |  75,704  |  $  |  80,611   \n(1)  |  Other operating expense (income), net includes: acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives; costs of closed restaurants; operating restaurant impairment charges; accelerated depreciation and gains/losses on disposition of property and equipment, net.   \n---|---  \n(2)  |  Amortization of cloud computing costs includes the amounts for the non-cash amortization of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud-based software arrangements that are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.   \n(3)  |  Net COLI gains reflect market-based adjustments on the company-owned life insurance policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies.   \n(4)  |  Pension and post-retirement benefit costs relating to our two legacy defined benefit pension plans, as well as the two legacy post-retirement plans.   \n  \n**_Restaurant-Level Margin_ **\n\nRestaurant-Level Margin is defined as company restaurant sales less restaurant operating costs (food and packaging, labor, and occupancy costs) and is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant-Level Margin excludes revenues and expenses of our franchise operations and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Certain other costs, such as depreciation and amortization, other operating expenses (income), net, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, and other costs that are considered normal operating costs are excluded as they are considered corporate-level shared service costs. As such, Restaurant-Level Margin is not indicative of the overall results of the company and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Restaurant-Level Margin should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. The company is presenting Restaurant-Level Margin because it believes that it provides a meaningful supplement to net earnings of the company's core business operating results, as well as a comparison to those of other similar companies. Management utilizes Restaurant-Level Margin as a key performance indicator to evaluate the profitability of company-operated restaurants. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of non-GAAP Restaurant-Level Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, earnings from operations (in thousands): \n\n**12 weeks ended April 14, 2024**  \n---  \n**Jack in the Box** |  **Del Taco** |  **Other (1)** |  **Total**  \nEarnings from operations - GAAP  |  $  |  84,980  |  $  |  9,039  |  $  |  (39,829  |  )  |  $  |  54,190   \nFranchise rental revenues  |  (79,618  |  )  |  (6,208  |  )  |  —  |  (85,826  |  )   \nFranchise royalties and other  |  (47,537  |  )  |  (7,547  |  )  |  —  |  (55,084  |  )   \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services  |  (50,179  |  )  |  (7,160  |  )  |  —  |  (57,339  |  )   \nFranchise occupancy expenses  |  50,849  |  6,242  |  —  |  57,091   \nFranchise support and other costs  |  2,757  |  1,103  |  —  |  3,860   \nFranchise advertising and other services expenses  |  52,003  |  7,520  |  —  |  59,523   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  9,752  |  7,112  |  20,656  |  37,520   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  —  |  —  |  13,906  |  13,906   \nPre-opening costs  |  322  |  280  |  —  |  602   \nOther operating expenses (income), net  |  —  |  —  |  5,267  |  5,267   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  —  |  1,065  |  —  |  1,065   \nRestaurant-Level Margin - Non-GAAP  |  $  |  23,329  |  $  |  11,446  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  34,775   \nCompany restaurant sales  |  $  |  98,927  |  $  |  68,171  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  167,098   \nRestaurant-Level Margin % - Non-GAAP  |  23.6  |  %  |  16.8  |  %  |  N/A  |  20.8  |  %   \n**12 weeks ended April 16, 2023**  \n---  \n**Jack in the Box** |  **Del Taco** |  **Other (1)** |  **Total**  \nEarnings from operations - GAAP  |  $  |  86,231  |  $  |  12,286  |  $  |  (36,878  |  )  |  $  |  61,639   \nFranchise rental revenues  |  (80,910  |  )  |  (2,610  |  )  |  —  |  (83,520  |  )   \nFranchise royalties and other  |  (48,071  |  )  |  (5,911  |  )  |  —  |  (53,982  |  )   \nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services  |  (50,361  |  )  |  (5,277  |  )  |  —  |  (55,638  |  )   \nFranchise occupancy expenses  |  50,007  |  2,642  |  —  |  52,649   \nFranchise support and other costs  |  2,735  |  525  |  —  |  3,260   \nFranchise advertising and other services expenses  |  52,660  |  5,483  |  —  |  58,143   \nSelling, general and administrative expenses  |  8,959  |  11,146  |  19,300  |  39,405   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  —  |  —  |  14,598  |  14,598   \nPre-opening costs  |  102  |  52  |  —  |  154   \nOther operating expenses (income), net  |  —  |  —  |  2,980  |  2,980   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  (904  |  )  |  200  |  —  |  (704  |  )   \nRestaurant-Level Margin - Non-GAAP  |  $  |  20,448  |  $  |  18,536  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  38,984   \nCompany restaurant sales  |  $  |  95,489  |  $  |  107,115  |  $  |  —  |  $  |  202,604   \nRestaurant-Level Margin % - Non-GAAP  |  21.4  |  %  |  17.3  |  %  |  N/A  |  19.2  |  %   \n  \n(1) The \"Other\" category includes shared services costs and other unallocated costs \n\n**_Franchise-Level Margin_ **\n\nFranchise-Level Margin is defined as franchise revenues less franchise operating costs (occupancy expenses, advertising contributions, and franchise support and other costs) and is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nNature of operations — Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, develops, operates, and franchises quick-service\nrestaurants under the Jack in the Box® and Del Taco® restaurant brands.\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company acquired Del Taco Restaurants, Inc. (“Del Taco”) for cash according to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of\nMerger, dated as of December 5, 2021.\nAs of April 14, 2024, there were 144 company-operated and 2,051 franchise-operated Jack in the Box restaurants and 166 company-operated and 429\nfranchise-operated Del Taco restaurants.\nReferences to the Company throughout these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements are made using the first person notations of “we,” “us” and\n“our.”\nBasis of presentation — The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThese financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”). The accounting policies used in preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are the same as those described in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nIn our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial condition and results of operations for these interim periods have been\nincluded. Operating results for one interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for any other interim period or for the full year.\nFiscal year — The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal year\nending the Tuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s fiscal\n2024 results include two fewer days. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 include 52 weeks. Our first quarter includes 16 weeks and all other quarters include 12 weeks.\nAll comparisons between 2024 and 2023 refer to the 12 weeks (“quarter”) and 28 weeks (“year-to-date”) ended April 14, 2024 and April 16, 2023, respectively,\nunless otherwise indicated.\nUse of estimates — In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make certain\nassumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. In making these\nassumptions and estimates, management may from time to time seek advice and consider information provided by actuaries and other experts in a particular\narea. Actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates.\nAdvertising costs — The Company administers marketing funds at each of its restaurant brands that include contractual contributions. In 2024 and 2023,\nmarketing fund contributions from Jack in the Box franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 5.0% of sales, and marketing fund\ncontributions from Del Taco franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 4.0% of sales. Year-to-date incremental contributions made by\nthe Company for both brands were $0.2 million in 2024, and less than $0.1 million in 2023, respectively.\nTotal contributions made by the Company are included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of earnings and for the quarter and year-to-date totaled $7.8 million and $18.2 million, respectively, in 2024, and $9.2 million and $21.3 million,\nrespectively in 2023.\nAllowance for credit losses — The Company closely monitors the financial condition of our franchisees and estimates the allowance for credit losses based on\nthe lifetime expected loss on receivables. These estimates are based on historical collection experience with our franchisees as well as other factors, including\ncurrent market conditions and events. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments compared to predefined aging criteria and known facts\nregarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\n7\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nApril 14, April 16,\n2024 2023\nBalance as of beginning of period $ (4,146) $ (5,975)\n(Provision) reversal for expected credit losses (233) 1,911\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance 6 —\nBalance as of end of period $ (4,373) $ (4,064)\nBusiness combinations — The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired, including the\namount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill and trademarks — Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, if any. We generally record\ngoodwill in connection with the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees or the acquisition of another business. Likewise, upon the sale of restaurants to\nfranchisees, goodwill is decremented. The amount of goodwill written-off is determined as the fair value of the business disposed of as a percentage of the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit prior to the disposal. If the business disposed of was never fully integrated into the reporting unit after its acquisition, and thus the\nbenefits of the acquired goodwill were never realized, the current carrying amount of the acquired goodwill is written off.\nGoodwill is not amortized and has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The Company’s two restaurant brands, Jack in the Box\nand Del Taco, are both operating segments and reporting units. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting\nunits exceed their carrying values.\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. The\nCompany performs this testing during the third quarter of each year.\nOur impairment analyses first includes a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Significant factors considered in this assessment include, but are not limited to, macro-economic\nconditions, market and industry conditions, cost considerations, the competitive environment, share price fluctuations, overall financial performance, and\nresults of past impairment tests. If the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we perform a\nquantitative impairment test.\nRecent accounting pronouncements — In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosure,” which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements. The ASU primarily requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment\nexpenses and information used to assess segment performance and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement\nin our disclosures, and does not expect it to have a significant impact.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disaggregated\ninformation about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard\nretrospectively. The Company does not expect this pronouncement to have a significant impact.\n2. REVENUE\nNature of products and services — The Company derives revenue from retail sales at Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated restaurants and rental\nrevenue, royalties, advertising, and franchise and other fees from franchise-operated restaurants.\nOur franchise arrangements generally provide for an initial franchise fee per restaurant for a 20-year term, and generally require that franchisees pay royalty\nand marketing fees based upon a percentage of gross sales. The agreements also require franchisees to pay technology fees for both brands, as well as sourcing\nfees for Jack in the Box franchise agreements.\n8\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

The payment represented the difference between the royalty rates based on projected future sales for\nthe remaining term of the existing agreements. The payment was non-refundable and not subject to any adjustments based on actual future sales. The Company\ndetermined the transaction represented the termination of the existing agreement rather than the transfer of an agreement between franchisees. As such, the $7.3 million\nwas recognized in franchise royalty revenue during the first quarter of 2023.\nContract liabilities — Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue resulting from initial franchise and development fees received from franchisees for new\nrestaurant openings or new franchise terms, which are recognized over the franchise term.

LEASES\nNature of leases — The Company owns restaurant sites and also leases restaurant sites from third parties. Some of these owned or leased sites are leased\nand/or subleased to franchisees. Initial terms of our real estate leases are generally 20 years, exclusive of options to renew, which are generally exercisable at\nour sole discretion for 1 to 20 years. In some instances, our leases have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined revenues. Many of\nour restaurants also have rent escalation clauses and require the payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Variable lease costs include\ncontingent rent, cost-of-living index adjustments, and payments for additional rent such as real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, which\nare excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.\nAs lessor, our leases and subleases primarily consist of restaurants that have been leased to franchisees in connection with refranchising transactions. Revenues\nfrom leasing arrangements with our franchisees are presented in “Franchise rental revenues” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\nearnings, and the related expenses are presented in “Franchise occupancy expenses.”\nThe following table presents rental income for the periods presented (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nOperating lease income - franchise $ 59,445 $ 55,713 $ 137,694 $ 129,233\nVariable lease income - franchise 26,123 27,744 60,721 62,979\nAmortization of sublease assets and liabilities, net 258 63 607 138\nFranchise rental revenues $ 85,826 $ 83,520 $ 199,022 $ 192,350\nOperating lease income - closed restaurants and other (1) $ 1,859 $ 1,785 $ 4,171 $ 4,025\n____________________________\n(1) Includes closed restaurant properties included in “Other operating expenses (income), net” in our condensed consolidated statements of earnings.\n12\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

The fair value of this obligation is based on the\nclosing market prices of the participants’ elected investments. The obligation is included in “Accrued liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” on our condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company did not have any transfers in or out of Level 1, 2 or 3 for its financial liabilities.\nThe following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value of our Class A-2 Notes as of April 14, 2024 and October 1, 2023 (in thousands):\nApril 14, October 1,\n2024 2023\nCarrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value\nSeries 2019 Class A-2 Notes $ 703,250 $ 663,206 $ 706,875 $ 640,046\nSeries 2022 Class A-2 Notes $ 1,056,000 $ 942,322 $ 1,067,000 $ 903,056\nThe fair value of the Class A-2 Notes was estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices in markets that are not considered active markets.\nNon-financial assets and liabilities — The Company’s non-financial instruments, which primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-\nuse assets, goodwill and intangible assets, are reported at carrying value and are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. However, on an\nannual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable, non-financial instruments are assessed\nfor impairment. If applicable, the carrying values are written down to fair value.\nIn connection with our impairment reviews performed during 2024, the Company impaired certain Del Taco assets.

In 2023, gains on\ndisposition of property and equipment primarily related to the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the properties from us prior\nto the sale.\n9. SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company’s principal business consists of developing, operating and franchising our Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurant brands, each of which is\nconsidered a reportable operating segment. In 2024, our chief operating decision maker revised the method by which they determine performance and strategy\nfor our segments. This change was made to reflect a shared-services model whereby each brand’s results of operations are assessed separately and do not\ninclude costs related to certain corporate functions which support both brands. This segment reporting structure reflects the Company’s current management\nstructure, internal reporting method and financial information used in deciding how to allocate Company resources. Based upon certain quantitative thresholds,\neach operating segment is considered a reportable segment. This change to our segment reporting did not change our reporting units for goodwill.\nThe Company measures and evaluates our segments based on segment revenues and segment profit. The reportable segments do not include an allocation of\nthe costs related to shared service functions, such as accounting/finance, human resources, audit services, legal, tax and treasury; nor do they include certain\nunallocated costs such share-based compensation. These costs are reflected in the caption “Shared services and unallocated costs.”\nOur measure of segment profit excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) gains, net of\nchanges in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies, acquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives, losses (gains) on\nthe sale of company-operated restaurants, gains on acquisition of restaurants, and amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net.\n14\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

INCOME TAXES\nThe income tax provisions reflect an effective tax rate of 26.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to 34.8% in the second quarter of the prior\nyear, as well as 26.7% for the year-to-date period in 2024, compared with 29.6% in the same period in 2023. The major component of the year-over-year\ndecrease in tax rates was a decrease in the impact of estimated disposals of non-deductible goodwill attributable to refranchising transactions.\n11. RETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined benefit pension plans — The Company sponsors two defined benefit pension plans, a frozen “Qualified Plan” covering substantially all full-time\nemployees hired prior to January 1, 2011, and an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) which provides certain employees additional\npension benefits and was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2007. Benefits under both plans are based on the employee’s years of service and\ncompensation over defined periods of employment.\nPost-retirement healthcare plans — The Company also sponsors two healthcare plans, closed to new participants, that provide post-retirement medical\nbenefits to certain employees who have met minimum age and service requirements. The plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually,\nand they contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n15\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

As of the date of our last actuarial funding\nvaluation, there was no minimum contribution funding requirement for the Qualified Plan. Details regarding 2024 contributions are as follows (in thousands):\nPost-Retirement\nSERP Healthcare Plans\nNet year-to-date contributions $ 2,620 $ 668\nRemaining estimated net contributions during fiscal 2024 $ 2,518 $ 437\nThe Company continues to evaluate contributions to our Qualified Plan based on changes in pension assets as a result of asset performance in the current\nmarket and the economic environment. The Company does not anticipate making any contributions to our Qualified Plan in fiscal 2024.\n12. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK\nRepurchases of common stock — The Company repurchased 0.5 million shares of its common stock in the year-to-date period ended April 14, 2024 for an\naggregate cost of $40.3 million, including applicable excise tax. As of April 14, 2024, there was $210.0 million remaining under share repurchase programs\nauthorized by the Board of Directors which do not expire.\nDividends — Through April 14, 2024, the Board of Directors declared two cash dividends of $0.44 per common share totaling $17.3 million. Future dividends\nare subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n16\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n13.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal matters — The Company assesses contingencies, including litigation contingencies, to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for\npotential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of April 14, 2024, the Company had accruals of $15.9 million for all of its legal matters in\naggregate, presented within “Accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing contingencies is\nhighly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate\ndue to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance coverage related to the\nclaim or claims in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the\nmatter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not\nmeaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals\nand related disclosures. The ultimate amount of loss may differ from these estimates. Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the\nCompany’s maximum possible loss exposure and the ultimate amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates in the near term.\nGessele v. Jack in the Box Inc. — In August 2010, five former Jack in the Box employees instituted litigation in federal court in Oregon alleging claims under\nthe federal Fair Labor Standards Act and Oregon wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs alleged that Jack in the Box failed to pay non-exempt employees for\ncertain meal breaks and improperly made payroll deductions for shoe purchases and for workers’ compensation expenses, and later added additional claims\nrelating to timing of final pay and related wage and hour claims involving employees of a franchisee. In 2016, the court dismissed the federal claims and those\nrelating to franchise employees. In June 2017, the court granted class certification with respect to state law claims of improper deductions and late payment of\nfinal wages. The parties participated in a voluntary mediation on March 16, 2020, but the matter did not settle. On October 24, 2022, a jury awarded plaintiffs\napproximately $6.4 million in damages and penalties. The Company continues to dispute liability and the damage award and both parties have filed appeals of\nthe verdict. As of April 14, 2024, the Company has accrued the verdict amount above, as well as estimated pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and fee\naward, for an additional $9.0 million. These amounts are included within “Accrued liabilities” on our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company will\ncontinue to accrue for post-judgment interest until the matter is resolved.\nTorrez — In March 2014, a former Del Taco employee filed a purported Private Attorneys General Act claim and class action alleging various causes of action\nunder California’s labor, wage, and hour laws. The plaintiff generally alleges Del Taco did not appropriately provide meal and rest breaks and failed to pay\nwages and reimburse business expenses to its California non-exempt employees. On November 12, 2021, the court granted, in part, the plaintiff's motion for\nclass certification. The parties participated in voluntary mediation on May 24, 2022 and June 3, 2022. On June 4, 2022, we entered into a Settlement\nMemorandum of Understanding which obligated the Company to pay a gross settlement amount of $50.0 million, for which in exchange we will be released\nfrom all claims by the parties. On August 8, 2023, the court issued its final approval of the settlement and on August 9, 2023 final judgement was entered. The\nCompany made its first payment of half of the settlement amount on August 28, 2023. Payment of the second half was made on November 27, 2023. As of\nApril 14, 2024, the Company does not have any further amounts accrued on our condensed consolidated balance sheet for this matter.\n17\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nJ&D Restaurant Group — On April 17, 2019, the trustee for a bankrupt former franchisee filed a complaint generally alleging the Company wrongfully\nterminated the franchise agreements and unreasonably denied two perspective purchasers the former franchisee presented. The parties participated in a\nmediation in April 2021, and again in December 2022, but the matter did not settle. The trial commenced on January 9, 2023 and on February 8, 2023, the jury\nreturned a verdict finding the Company had not breached any contracts in terminating the franchise agreements or denying the proposed buyers. However,\nwhile the jury also found the Company had not violated the California Unfair Practices Act, it found for the plaintiff on the claim for breach of implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and awarded $8.0 million in damages. On May 9, 2023, the court granted the Company’s post-trial motion, overturning\nthe jury verdict and ordering the plaintiff take nothing on its claims. As a result, the Company reversed the prior $8.0 million accrual, and as of April 14, 2024,\nthe Company has no amounts accrued for this case on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Plaintiff has appealed the trial court’s post-trial rulings.\nOther legal matters — In addition to the matters described above, we are subject to normal and routine litigation brought by former or current employees,\ncustomers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders, or others. We intend to defend ourselves in any such matters. Some of these matters may be covered,\nat least in part, by insurance or other third-party indemnity obligation. We record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be\nprobable.\nLease guarantees — We remain contingently liable for certain leases relating to our former Qdoba business which we sold in fiscal 2018. Under the Qdoba\nPurchase Agreement, the buyer has indemnified the Company of all claims related to these guarantees. As of April 14, 2024, the maximum potential liability of\nfuture undiscounted payments under these leases is approximately $21.0 million. The lease terms extend for a maximum of approximately 14 more years and\nwe would remain a guarantor of the leases in the event the leases are extended for any established renewal periods. In the event of default, we believe the\nexposure is limited due to contractual protections and recourse available in the lease agreements, as well as the Qdoba Purchase Agreement, including a\nrequirement of the landlord to mitigate damages by re-letting the properties in default, and indemnity from the Buyer. The Company has not recorded a liability\nfor these guarantees as we believe the likelihood of making any future payments is remote.\n15.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal year ending the\nTuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s fiscal 2024 results\ninclude two fewer days. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 include 52 weeks. Our first quarter includes 16 weeks and all other quarters include 12 weeks. All\ncomparisons between 2024 and 2023 refer to the 12 weeks (“quarter”) and 28 weeks (“year-to-date”) ended April 14, 2024 and April 16, 2023, respectively,\nunless otherwise indicated.\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during 2024 and 2023, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes included in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nOur MD&A consists of the following sections:\n• Overview — a general description of our business.\n• Results of operations — an analysis of our condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the periods presented in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n• Liquidity and capital resources — an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, share repurchase activity, dividends, and known\ntrends that may impact liquidity.\n• Discussion of critical accounting estimates — a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n• New accounting pronouncements — a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation and the impact on our consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations, if any.\n• Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements — a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from any forward-looking statements made by management.\nWe have included in our MD&A certain performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance and which we believe will be useful\nin analyzing and understanding our results of operations. These metrics include:\n• Changes in sales at restaurants open more than one year (“same-store sales”), systemwide sales, franchised restaurant sales, and average unit volumes\n(“AUVs”). Same-store sales, restaurant sales, and AUVs are presented for franchised restaurants and on a system-wide basis, which includes company\nand franchise restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at franchise restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales\nas revenues; however, our royalty revenues, marketing fees and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. We\nbelieve franchise and system same-store sales, franchised and system restaurant sales, and AUV information are useful to investors as they have a\ndirect effect on the Company’s profitability.\nSame-store sales, systemwide sales, franchised restaurant sales, and AUVs are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be\nconsidered in isolation, or as an alternative to earnings from operations, or other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nFounded in 1951, Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”) operates and franchises Jack in the Box® and Del Taco® quick-service restaurants. As of April 14,\n2024, we operated and franchised 2,195 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western and southern United States, including two in Guam,\nand 595 Del Taco quick-service restaurants across 16 states.\nWe derive revenue from retail sales at company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties (based upon a percent of sales), franchise fees and\ncontributions for advertising and other services from franchisees.\n20\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables summarize changes in same-store sales for Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated, franchised, and system restaurants:\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCompany (0.6 %) 10.8 % 0.9 % 11.8 %\nFranchise (2.6 %) 9.4 % (0.8 %) 8.2 %\nSystem (2.5 %) 9.5 % (0.7 %) 8.6 %\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, July 10,\nDel Taco: 2024 2023 2024 2022 (1)\nCompany (1.8 %) 3.5 % 0.2 % 3.3 %\nFranchise (1.1 %) 2.8 % 0.8 % 2.8 %\nSystem (1.4 %) 3.2 % 0.7 % 3.0 %\nThe following tables summarize year-to-date changes in the number and mix of company and franchise restaurants for our two brands:\n2024 2023\nJack in the Box: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 142 2,044 2,186 146 2,035 2,181\nNew 2 8 10 — 8 8\nRefranchised — — — (5) 5 —\nClosed — (1) (1) (1) (1) (2)\nEnd of period 144 2,051 2,195 140 2,047 2,187\n% of system 7 % 93 % 100 % 6 % 94 % 100 %\n2024 2023\nDel Taco: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 171 421 592 290 301 591\nNew — 6 6 — 5 5\nAcquired from franchisees 9 (9) — — — —\nRefranchised (13) 13 — (16) 16 —\nClosed (1) (2) (3) (1) — (1)\nEnd of period 166 429 595 273 322 595\n% of system 28 % 72 % 100 % 46 % 54 % 100 %\n21\nThe following tables summarize restaurant sales for company-operated, franchised, and systemwide sales for our two brands (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 98,927 $ 95,489 $ 230,984 $ 221,631\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 911,265 931,257 2,138,015 2,140,239\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 1,010,192 $ 1,026,746 $ 2,368,999 $ 2,361,870\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\nDel Taco: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 68,171 $ 107,115 $ 160,154 $ 251,164\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 154,854 118,896 353,330 264,994\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 223,025 $ 226,011 $ 513,484 $ 516,158\n____________________________\n(1) Franchised restaurant sales represent sales at franchised restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. System sales include company and franchised restaurant sales.\nWe do not record franchised sales as revenues; however, our royalty revenues, marketing fees and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of\nfranchised sales. We believe franchised and system restaurant sales information is useful to investors as they have a direct effect on the Company's profitability.\nJack in the Box Brand\nCompany Restaurant Operations\nThe following table presents company restaurant sales and costs as a percentage of the related sales (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, 2024 April 16, 2023 April 14, 2024 April 16, 2023\nCompany restaurant sales $ 98,927 $ 95,489 $ 230,984 $ 221,631\nCompany restaurant costs:\nFood and packaging $ 28,486 28.8 % $ 29,841 31.3 % $ 67,747 29.3 % $ 71,167 32.1 %\nPayroll and employee benefits $ 30,294 30.6 % $ 29,200 30.6 % $ 70,983 30.7 % $ 68,638 31.0 %\nOccupancy and other $ 16,818 17.0 % $ 15,999 16.8 % $ 38,477 16.7 % $ 36,376 16.4 %\nCompany restaurant sales increased $3.4 million, or 3.6% in the quarter and $9.4 million, million or 4.2% year-to-date compared to the prior year. The\nfollowing table presents the approximate impact of changes in AUVs and the number of restaurants on company restaurant sales for each respective period (in\nmillions):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nAUV (decrease) increase $ (0.6) $ 3.2\nChange in the average number of restaurants 4.0 6.2\nTotal change in company restaurant sales $ 3.4 $ 9.4\nSame-store sales at company-operated restaurants decreased 0.6% in the quarter and increased 0.9% year-to-date compared to a year ago. The following\ntable summarizes the change versus a year ago:\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAverage check (1) 3.1 % 7.6 % 3.5 % 7.6 %\nTransactions (3.7 %) 3.2 % (2.6 %) 4.2 %\nChange in same-store sales (0.6 %) 10.8 % 0.9 % 11.8 %\n22\n____________________________\n(1) Includes price increases of approximately 7.4% in the quarter and 7.3% year-to-date.\nFood and packaging costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales decreased 2.5% in the quarter and 2.8% year-to-date compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to commodity deflation and menu price increases, partially offset by unfavorable menu item mix.\nCommodity deflation was 0.5% in the quarter and 1.9% year-to-date. The greatest impacts were seen in poultry and beef in the quarter, and produce, beef\nand oil on a year-to-date basis.\nPayroll and employee benefit costs as a percentage of company restaurant sales was flat in the quarter and decreased 0.3% year-to-date compared to the\nprior year. During the quarter, increases in wage inflation and group insurance were offset by decreases in incentive compensation. The decrease on a year-to-\ndate basis is primarily due to sales leverage and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by wage inflation and higher group insurance costs. Labor\ninflation was approximately 4.6% in the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date for the current year.\nOccupancy and other costs, as a percentage of company restaurant sales, increased 0.2% in the quarter and 0.3% year-to-date compared to the prior year.\nThese increases were primarily due to higher other operating costs including security, credit card fees, rent and delivery fees, partially offset by sales leverage\nyear-to-date and lower maintenance and repair costs in both the quarter and year-to-date.\nJack in the Box Franchise Operations\nThe following table presents franchise revenues and costs in each period and other information we believe is useful in analyzing the change in franchise\noperating results (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nFranchise rental revenues $ 79,618 $ 80,910 $ 185,196 $ 187,006\nRoyalties 45,414 46,401 106,737 113,970\nFranchise fees and other 2,123 1,670 4,143 3,467\nFranchise royalties and other 47,537 48,071 110,880 117,437\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services 50,179 50,361 117,541 115,674\nTotal franchise revenues $ 177,334 $ 179,342 $ 413,617 $ 420,117\nFranchise occupancy expenses $ 50,849 $ 50,007 $ 116,037 $ 114,562\nFranchise support and other costs 2,757 2,735 6,505 4,151\nFranchise advertising and other services expenses 52,003 52,660 121,896 120,618\nTotal franchise costs $ 105,609 $ 105,402 $ 244,438 $ 239,331\nFranchise costs as a percentage of total franchise revenues 59.6% 58.8% 59.1% 57.0%\nAverage number of franchise restaurants 2,037 2,037 2,037 2,035\n% increase —% 0.1%\nFranchised restaurant sales $ 911,265 $ 931,257 $ 2,138,015 $ 2,140,239\nFranchised restaurant AUVs $ 447 $ 457 $ 1,050 $ 1,052\nRoyalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales (1) 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% 5.3%\n____________________________\n(1) Excluding the impact of the $7.3 million termination fee in the first quarter of 2023 royalties as a percentage of total franchised restaurant sales would be 5.0%.\nFranchise rental revenues decreased $1.3 million, or 1.6% in the quarter and $1.8 million, or 1.0% year-to-date, compared to the prior year primarily due to\nlower percentage rent of $2.5 million in the quarter and $3.5 million year-to-date, respectively, driven by lower franchise restaurant sales. These decreases were\npartially offset by increases in minimum rent of $0.9 million and $1.9 million, in the respective periods.\n23\nFranchise royalties and other decreased $0.5 million, or 1.1% in the quarter and $6.6 million, or 5.6% year-to-date. In the quarter, the decrease was\nprimarily due to lower royalty income of $1.0 million, partially offset by an increase in franchise termination fees. The year-to-date decrease was primarily due\nto a $7.3 million termination fee paid in the prior year by a franchise operator to sell his restaurants to a new franchisee, partially offset by an increase in\nfranchise early termination fees in the current year. Refer also to Note 2, Revenue, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation.\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services revenues decreased $0.2 million, or 0.4% in the quarter and increased $1.9 million, or 1.6% year-\nto-date, as compared to the prior year. The decrease in the quarter is primarily due to lower marketing contribution of $1.1 million, driven by lower franchise\nrestaurant sales, partially offset by an increase in digital and and technology fees of $0.8 million. On a year-to-date basis, the increase is primarily due to the\nincrease in digital and technology fees of $1.8 million.\nFranchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased $0.8 million, or 1.7% in the quarter and $1.5 million, or 1.3% year-to-date compared to the prior\nyear primarily due to an increase in operating lease costs in the current year.\nFranchise support and other costs was flat in the quarter and increased $2.4 million, or 56.7% year-to-date compared to the prior year. Year-to-date, the\nincrease is primarily due to the rollover of a bad debt reversal in the prior year.\nFranchise advertising and other service expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 1.2% in the quarter and increased $1.3 million, or 1.1% year-to-date compared\nto the prior year. In the quarter, the decrease is primarily driven by lower franchise sales, partially offset by higher costs for digital processing fees. Year-to-\ndate, the increase is primarily driven by higher franchise IT revenue costs as well as higher costs for digital processing fees, partially offset by lower sales\ndriving lower marketing expenses.\nDel Taco Brand\nCompany Restaurant Operations\nThe following table presents company restaurant sales and costs as a percentage of the related sales (dollars in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, 2024 April 16, 2023 April 14, 2024 April 16, 2023\nCompany restaurant sales $ 68,171 $ 107,115 $ 160,154 $ 251,164\nCompany restaurant costs:\nFood and packaging $ 17,428 25.6 % $ 29,468 27.5 % $ 42,300 26.4 % $ 70,076 27.9 %\nPayroll and employee benefits $ 23,760 34.9 % $ 35,835 33.5 % $ 56,126 35.0 % $ 85,038 33.9 %\nOccupancy and other $ 15,537 22.8 % $ 23,276 21.7 % $ 35,931 22.4 % $ 54,269 21.6 %\nCompany restaurant sales decreased $38.9 million or 36.4% in the quarter and $91.0 million or 36.2% year-to-date compared to the prior year. These\ndecreases were primarily due to the refranchising of 108 company-operated restaurants and the closing of 8 company-operated restaurants since the second\nquarter of 2023. The following table presents the approximate impact of changes in AUVs and the number of restaurants on company restaurant sales for each\nrespective period on company restaurant sales (in millions):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nAUV (decrease) increase $ (1.2) $ 0.4\nChange in the average number of restaurants (37.7) (91.4)\nTotal change in company restaurant sales $ (38.9) $ (91.0)\n24\nSame-store sales at company-operated restaurants decreased 1.8% in the quarter and increased 0.2% year-to-date compared to a year ago.

The\nincrease is primarily due to higher rental income resulting from new subleases related to the 108 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023.\nFranchise royalties and other increased $1.6 million, or 27.7%, in the quarter and $4.6 million, or 35.6% year-to-date, compared to the prior year primarily\ndue to higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 108 restaurants refranchised and the 15 franchise-operated restaurants opened since the second\nquarter of 2023.\nFranchise contributions for advertising and other services revenues increased $1.9 million, or 35.7%, in the quarter and $5.1 million, or 43.6% year-to-\ndate, compared to the prior year primarily due to higher marketing contributions related to higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 108 restaurants\nrefranchised and the 15 franchise-operated restaurants opened since the second quarter of 2023.\nFranchise occupancy expenses, primarily rent, increased $3.6 million, or 136.3%, in the quarter and $8.4 million, or 157.6% year-to-date, compared to the\nprior year primarily due to higher rent related to franchise subleases for the 108 restaurants refranchised since the second quarter of 2023.\nFranchise support and other costs increased $0.6 million, or 110.1%, in the quarter and $1.6 million, or 158.3% year-to-date, compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to higher franchise development support costs.\nFranchise advertising and other service expenses increased $2.0 million, or 37.2%, in the quarter and $5.8 million, or 47.7% year-to-date, compared to the\nprior year primarily due to higher franchise restaurant sales resulting from the 108 restaurants refranchised and the 15 franchise-operated restaurants opened\nsince the second quarter of 2023.\nCompany-Wide Results\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization for the quarter ended April 14, 2024 decreased $0.7 million in the quarter and $1.6 million year-to-date compared to the\nprior year period. The decreases in depreciation are primarily due to the refranchising of Del Taco restaurants since the prior year, as well as certain Jack in the\nBox franchise assets becoming fully depreciated. These decreases were partially offset by increases for new technology assets and new company restaurant\nopenings.\nSelling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses\nThe following table presents the amounts for SG&A expenses in each period (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAdvertising $ 7,778 $ 9,159 $ 18,171 $ 21,312\nIncentive compensation 1,856 6,004 6,482 11,149\nShare-based compensation 3,841 2,399 8,662 5,932\nCash surrender value of COLI policies, net (1,232) (844) (6,066) (6,568)\nLitigation matters 472 (1,141) 718 4,929\nOther 24,805 23,828 55,918 52,793\n$ 37,520 $ 39,405 $ 83,885 $ 89,547\nAdvertising costs represent company contributions to our marketing funds and are generally determined as a percentage of company-operated restaurant\nsales. Advertising costs decreased $1.4 million in the quarter and $3.1 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease\nin company-operated restaurant sales in the current year which was driven by refranchising.\nIncentive compensation decreased by $4.1 million in the quarter and $4.7 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year primarily due to\nlower achievement levels compared to the prior year for the Company’s annual incentive plan.\nShare-based compensation increased by $1.4 million in the quarter and $2.7 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year primarily due to\nhigher achievement relating to performance-based equity awards.\nThe cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation\nsupported by these policies, are subject to market fluctuations. The changes in market values had a slightly favorable impact of $0.4 million in the quarter, but\nan unfavorable impact of $0.5 million on a year-to-date basis, compared to the prior year.\n26\nLitigation matters increased $1.6 million in the quarter and decreased $4.2 million on a year-to-date basis as compared to the prior year primarily due to\nthe timing of litigation developments in each period, respectively. Refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the condensed consolidated financial\nstatements for additional information related to the legal matters.\nOther Operating Expenses (Income), Net\nOther operating expenses (income), net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives $ 4,268 $ 1,259 $ 9,889 $ 2,896\nCosts of closed restaurants and other 773 560 1,632 2,745\nAccelerated depreciation 88 185 125 453\nGains on acquisition of restaurants — — (2,357) —\nLosses (gains) on disposition of property and equipment, net 138 976 1,148 (8,615)\n$ 5,267 $ 2,980 $ 10,437 $ (2,521)\nOther operating expenses (income), net increased $2.3 million in the quarter and $13.0 million on a year-to-date basis, as compared to the prior year. For\nthe quarter the increase was primarily due to $2.0 million of consulting fees for strategic initiatives in the current year. For the year-to-date period, the increase\nwas due to $9.5 million of gains recognized in the prior year from a sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the properties\nfrom us prior to the sale as well as an increase of $7.0 million of consulting fees for strategic initiatives in the current year, partially offset by $2.4 million\npurchase gains related to the acquisition of 9 Del Taco restaurants, as well as a $1.1 million decrease in costs of closed restaurants in the in the current year.\nGains and Losses on the Sale of Company-Operated Restaurants\nFor the fiscal 2024 year-to-date period, the Company sold 13 Del Taco company-operated restaurants to franchisees, for which the Company recognized a\nnet loss on the sale of company-operated restaurants of $1.3 million.\nFor the fiscal 2023 year-to-date period, the Company sold five Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants and 16 Del Taco company-operated\nrestaurants to franchisees, for which the Company recognized a net gain on the sale of company-operated restaurants of $4.5 million.\nRefer to Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings and Assets Held for Sale, of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding these transactions.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nQuarter Year-to-date\nApril 14, April 16, April 14, April 16,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nInterest expense $ 18,997 $ 19,724 $ 44,360 $ 46,261\nInterest income (394) (367) (1,271) (756)\nInterest expense, net $ 18,603 $ 19,357 $ 43,089 $ 45,505\nInterest expense, net, decreased $0.8 million in the quarter and $2.4 million year-to-date primarily due to lower average borrowings as well as lower\naverage interest rates resulting in a decrease of $0.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, in interest expense compared to the prior year. Additionally, there\nwas an increase in interest income of $0.5 million year-to-date due to higher investment balances compared to fiscal year 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe income tax provisions reflect an effective tax rate of 26.5% in the second quarter of 2024, as compared to 34.8% in the second quarter of the prior\nyear, as well as 26.7% for the year-to-date period in 2024, as compared to 29.6% in the same period in 2023. The major component of the year-over-year\ndecrease in tax rates was a decrease in the impact of estimated disposals of non-deductible goodwill attributable to refranchising transactions.\n27\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit\nfacilities. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service\nrequirements, franchise tenant improvement allowance and incentive distributions, dividend payments, and obligations related to our benefit plans. We\ngenerally use available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common\nstock.\nAs of April 14, 2024, the Company had $49.0 million of cash and restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheet and available borrowings of $175.5\nmillion under our $150.0 million Variable Funding Notes and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company continually assesses the optimal sources\nand uses of cash for our business. We review our balance sheet for any undervalued assets and pursue opportunities for capital sources, including the sale of our\nowned Jack in the Box properties and refranchising, primarily for Del Taco in the near term.\nBased upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing\nfacility and revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve\nmonths and the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nApril 14, April 16,\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (6,021) $ 94,108\nInvesting activities (55,854) 9,730\nFinancing activities (75,055) (117,042)\nNet cash flows $ (136,930) $ (13,204)\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flows decreased $100.1 million compared with a year ago. This is primarily due to an unfavorable change in\nworking capital of $95.5 million, as well as lower net income, when adjusted for non-cash items, of $4.6 million. The change in working capital is primarily a\nresult of the decrease of $60.8 million of income tax liabilities (of which $50.3 million was a payment deferred from 2023 in connection with the Southern\nCalifornia winter storm disaster area declaration), a decrease in accrued legal for the final payment of the Torrez litigation of $25.5 million, and a decrease in\nthe advertising accruals of $11.3 million due to timing.\nInvesting Activities. Cash flows from investing activities decreased by $65.6 million compared with a year ago primarily due to higher purchases of\nproperty and equipment of $23.9 million in the current year, lower proceeds from the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees of $21.9\nmillion in the current year, and lower proceeds from the sale of company-operated restaurants of $16.4 million.\n28\nCapital Expenditures — The composition of capital expenditures in each period follows (in thousands):\nYear-to-date\nApril 14, April 16,\n2024 2023\nRestaurants:\nRemodel / refresh programs $ 6,278 $ 4,863\nRestaurant facility expenditures 21,545 15,058\nPurchases of assets intended for sale 11,985 5,801\nPurchase of land 2,144 —\nRestaurant information technology 12,491 8,607\n54,443 34,329\nCorporate Services:\nInformation technology 6,566 2,625\nCorporate facilities 62 242\n6,628 2,867\nTotal capital expenditures $ 61,071 $ 37,196\nThe increase in restaurant facility expenditures includes amounts spent on capital maintenance and other operational initiatives. The increase for the\npurchases of assets intended for sale and/or sale and leaseback includes amounts spent on exercising our right of first refusal to purchase land and building\nwhich we intend to sell and leaseback. The increase for corporate information technology includes spending in connection with our new enterprise resource\nplanning system and digital workflow platform.\nSale of Company-Operated Restaurants — The following table details proceeds received in connection with our refranchising activities in each period\n(dollars in thousands).\nYear-to-date\nApril 14, April 16,\n2024 2023\nNumber of Jack in the Box restaurants sold to franchisees — 5\nNumber of Del Taco restaurants sold to franchisees 13 16\nTotal proceeds $ 1,989 $ 18,417\nFor further information, see Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings and Assets Held for Sale, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFinancing Activities. Cash flows from financing activities decreased by $42.0 million compared with a year ago. The change is primarily due to the $50.0\nmillion repayment in the prior year on the Variable Funding Notes, partially offset by the $7.4 million increase in stock repurchases in the current year versus\nthe prior year.\nRepurchases of common stock — The Company repurchased 0.5 million shares of its common stock in fiscal 2024 for an aggregate cost of $40.3 million.\nAs of April 14, 2024, there was $210.0 million remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors which do not expire.\nDividends — Up through April 14, 2024, the Board of Directors declared two cash dividends of $0.44 per common share totaling $17.3 million.\nOn May 10, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share, to be paid on June 25, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the\nclose of business on June 6, 2024.\nSecuritized Refinancing Transaction — On February 11, 2022, the Company completed the sale of $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 3.445% Fixed Rate\nSenior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) and $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 4.136% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II\n(the “Class A-2-II Notes” and, together with the Class A-2-I Notes, the “2022 Notes”). Interest payments on the 2022 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis.\nThe anticipated repayment dates of the 2022 Class A-2-I Notes and the Class A-2-II Notes will be February 2027 and February 2032, respectively, unless\nearlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the indenture that governs the 2022 Notes. The anticipated repayment dates of the existing 2019-1 Class A-2-II\nNotes and the Class A-2-III Notes are August 2026 and August 2029, respectively.\n29\nThe Company also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes (the “Variable Funding Notes”),\nwhich permits borrowings up to a maximum of $150.0 million, subject to certain borrowing conditions, a portion of which may be used to issue letters of\ncredit. As of April 14, 2024, we did not have any outstanding borrowings and had available borrowing capacity of $100.5 million under our Variable Funding\nNotes, net of letters of credits issued of $49.5 million.\nThe 2022 Notes were issued in a privately placed securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s revenue-generating assets,\nconsisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are\nheld by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as Guarantors of\nthe Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Notes. The\n2022 Notes are subject to the same covenants and restrictions as the Series 2019-1 Notes.\nThe quarterly principal payment on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding\nthe leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. Subsequent to closing the issuance of the 2022 Notes, the Company has\nhad a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on its 2022 Notes and Series\n2019-1 Notes beginning in the second quarter of 2022.\nRestricted cash — In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, certain cash accounts have been established with the Indenture trustee for the benefit of\nthe note holders and are restricted in their use. As of April 14, 2024, the Company had restricted cash of $28.8 million, which primarily represented cash\ncollections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of interest and commitment fees required for the Class A-1 and A-2 Notes.\nCovenants and restrictions — The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the\nMaster Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and\nmandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under\ncertain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways\ndefective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid\namortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of gross sales for\nspecified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay\nor refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events\nrelating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain\ntime frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.\nAs of April 14, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenant requirements and were not subject to any rapid amortization events.\nRevolving credit facility — In connection with the Del Taco acquisition, Del Taco’s existing debt related to a Syndicated Credit Facility dated August 5,\n2015, was repaid and extinguished on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Del Taco entered into a new syndicated credit facility with an aggregate principal\namount of up to $75.0 million, which was extended and now matures on February 28, 2025. The revolving credit facility, as amended, includes a limit of\n$20.0 million for letters of credit, all of which were cancelled as of October 1, 2023. As of April 14, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and available\nborrowing capacity of $75.0 million under the facility.\nDISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are most important for the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results,\nand that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in\nmaterially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to the critical\naccounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.\n30\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Reports First Quarter 2024 Earnings\n\nFebruary 21, 2024\n\n**Jack in the Box same-store sales of +0.8%; Del Taco same-store sales of +2.2%**\n\n**Jack in the Box systemwide sales growth of +1.8%; Del Taco systemwide sales growth of +0.1%**\n\n**Diluted EPS of $1.93; Operating EPS of $1.95**\n\n**Jack in the Box restaurant level margin of 23.1%, up 3.3% from prior year**\n\n**Jack in the Box signed development agreements with new franchisees to expand in Florida and enter Michigan**\n\n**New Smashed Jack burger sold out in less than 3 weeks during Q1 soft launch**\n\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  **Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ: JACK)** announced financial results for the Jack in the Box and Del Taco brands in the first quarter, ended January 21, 2024. \n\n“The first quarter included notable progress on our long-term strategy and objectives we laid out at our recent Investor Day,” said Darin Harris, Jack in the Box Chief Executive Officer. “We were also pleased with the sales rebound for Del Taco, the outperformance of Jack in the Box restaurant level margin, and the completion of development agreements with new franchisees to open new markets. These results are a reflection of our compelling brands, as well as our initiatives to maximize four-wall economics and franchise profitability, which will continue to fuel our growth plan.” \n\n** Jack in the Box Performance **\n\nSame-store sales increased 0.8% in the first quarter, comprised of franchise same-store sales growth of 0.7% and company-owned same-store sales growth of 2.0%. Both franchise and company-owned restaurants experienced growth in average check, declines in transactions, and notable negative weather impact toward the end of the quarter. Systemwide sales for the first quarter increased 1.8%. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $30.4 million, or 23.1%, up from $25.0 million, or 19.8%, a year ago driven primarily by commodity deflation and sales leverage. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $97.5 million, or 41.2%, a decrease from $106.8 million, or 44.4%, a year ago. The decrease was mainly driven by the lap of a prior year Hawaii transaction royalty buyout which had a $7.3 million, or 1.7%, positive impact on franchise level margin in the first quarter of 2023. \n\nJack in the Box grew net restaurant count by six in the first quarter, with seven restaurant openings and one restaurant closure. As of the first quarter, and since the launch of the development program in mid-2021, the company currently has 91 signed agreements for a total of 399 restaurants. Under these agreements, 41 restaurants have opened, leaving 358 remaining for future development. \n\n**Jack in the Box Same-Store Sales:** |  **16 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**January 21, 2024** |  **January 22, 2023**  \nCompany  |  2.0  |  %  |  12.6  |  %   \nFranchise  |  0.7  |  %  |  7.4  |  %   \nSystem  |  0.8  |  %  |  7.8  |  %   \n  \n**Jack in the Box Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nRestaurant count at beginning of Q1  |  142  |  2,044  |  2,186  |  146  |  2,035  |  2,181   \nNew  |  2  |  5  |  7  |  —  |  6  |  6   \nRefranchised  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (5  |  )  |  5  |  0   \nClosed  |  —  |  (1  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  (1  |  )   \nRestaurant count at end of Q1  |  144  |  2,048  |  2,192  |  140  |  2,046  |  2,186   \nQ1 Net Restaurant Increase/(Decrease)  |  2  |  4  |  6   \nYTD Net Restaurant % Increase/(Decrease) [Q1'24 vs. Q4'23]  |  1.4  |  %  |  0.2  |  %  |  0.3  |  %   \n  \n** Del Taco Performance **\n\nSame-store sales increased 2.2% in the first quarter, comprised of franchise same-store sales growth of 2.4% and company-operated same-store sales growth of 1.8%. Sales performance included increases in average check via menu pricing, partially offset by changes in menu mix and transaction declines. Systemwide sales for the fiscal first quarter increased 0.1%, which was negatively impacted by a calendar shift due to aligning Del Taco's reporting calendar to Jack in the Box, as well as a temporary 12-week closure of a restaurant undergoing a fresh flex rebuild during the first quarter. \n\nRestaurant-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $14.4 million, or 15.6%, down from $23.2 million, or 16.1%, a year ago. The dollar decrease was primarily a function of refranchising over 100 restaurants during the prior fiscal year. The margin decrease was due mainly to wage and utility inflation as well as a change in the mix of restaurants, partially offset by commodity deflation. \n\nFranchise-Level Margin(1), a non-GAAP measure, was $8.0 million, or 29.3%, up from $6.4 million, or 39.6%, a year ago. The decrease in margin percentage was driven by higher franchise costs and the impact of a higher franchise mix with pass-through rent and advertising, partially offset by growth in franchise same-store sales. \n\nDel Taco had no change in total restaurant count in the first quarter, with three restaurant openings and three restaurant closings. Restaurant count at the end of the first quarter also reflects the Company's acquisition of 9 franchise restaurants primarily in the Detroit market, which the company will now own and operate with the purpose of improving performance and refranchising thereafter. \n\n**Del Taco Same-Store Sales:** |  **16 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n**January 21, 2024** |  **January 22, 2023**  \nCompany  |  1.8  |  %  |  3.1  |  %   \nFranchise  |  2.4  |  %  |  2.8  |  %   \nSystem  |  2.2  |  %  |  3.0  |  %   \n  \n**Del Taco Restaurant Counts:**\n\n**2024** |  **2023**  \n---|---  \n**Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total** |  **Company** |  **Franchise** |  **Total**  \nRestaurant count at beginning of Q1  |  171  |  421  |  592  |  290  |  301  |  591   \nNew  |  —  |  3  |  3  |  —  |  2  |  2   \nAcquired from franchisees  |  9  |  (9  |  )  |  0  |  —  |  —  |  —   \nRefranchised  |  —  |  —  |  —  |  (16  |  )  |  16  |  0   \nClosed  |  (1  |  )  |  (2  |  )  |  (3  |  )  |  (1  |  )  |  —  |  (1  |  )   \nRestaurant count at end of Q1  |  179  |  413  |  592  |  273  |  319  |  592   \nQ1 Net Restaurant Increase/(Decrease)  |  8  |  (8  |  )  |  0   \nYTD Net Restaurant % Increase/(Decrease) [Q1'24 vs. Q4'23]  |  4.7  |  %  |  (1.9  |  )%  |  —  |  %   \n  \n** Company-Wide Performance **\n\nFirst quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.93. Operating Earnings Per Share(2), a non-GAAP measure, was $1.95 in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $2.01 in the prior year quarter. \n\nTotal revenues decreased 7.5% to $487.5 million, compared to $527.1 million in the prior year quarter. The lower reported revenue is primarily the result of the Del Taco refranchising efforts. Net earnings decreased to $38.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, compared with $53.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(3), a non-GAAP measure, was $101.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $108.6 million for the prior year quarter. \n\nCompany-wide SG&A expense for the first quarter was $46.4 million, a decrease of $3.8 million compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to a prior year legal accrual along with lower advertising costs from the Del Taco refranchising. These decreases were partially offset by higher stock compensation as well as changes in the net cash surrender value of company owned life insurance (\"COLI\") policies. When excluding net COLI gains, our G&A was 2.5% of systemwide sales. \n\nThe income tax provisions reflect a year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.9% in 2024, as compared to 26.7% in fiscal year 2023. The Non-GAAP Operating EPS tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 27.2%. \n\n(1) Restaurant-Level Margin and Franchise-Level Margin are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to earnings from operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the attachment to this release. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.” (2) Operating Earnings Per Share represents the diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis, excluding certain adjustments. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.” Operating earnings per share may not add due to rounding. (3) Adjusted EBITDA represents net earnings on a GAAP basis excluding certain adjustments. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results.” \n\n** Capital Allocation **\n\nThe Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of $25.2 million in the first quarter. As of the end of the first quarter, there was $225.0 million remaining under the Board-authorized stock buyback program. \n\nOn February 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share, to be paid on March 27, 2024, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2024. Future dividends will be subject to approval by the Board of Directors. \n\n** Guidance & Outlook Updates **\n\nAll guidance and outlook provided on November 21, 2023, for the fiscal year ending September 29, 2024, remain the same as previously disclosed. \n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call for analysts and investors on Wednesday, February 21, 2024, beginning at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET).

AND SUBSIDIARIES** **RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS TO GAAP RESULTS** **(Unaudited)**\n\nTo supplement the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses the following non-GAAP measures: Adjusted Net Income, Operating Earnings Per Share, Adjusted EBITDA, Restaurant-Level Margin and Franchise-Level Margin. Management believes that these measurements, when viewed with the company's results of operations in accordance with GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations in the tables below, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period changes, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of the company's core business without regard to potential distortions. \n\n**_Operating Earnings Per Share_ **\n\nOperating Earnings Per Share represents diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis excluding acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives, net COLI gains, pension and post-retirement benefit costs, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, losses (gains) on the sale of real estate to franchisees, gains on acquisition of restaurants and the tax-related impacts of the above adjustments. \n\nOperating Earnings Per Share should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under U.S. GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. Management believes Operating Earnings Per Share provides investors with a meaningful supplement of the company’s operating performance and period-over-period changes without regard to potential distortions. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of net income.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting the company's ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. \n\nBelow is a reconciliation of non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net earnings (in thousands): \n\n**16 Weeks Ended**  \n---  \n**January 21, 2024** |  **January 22, 2023**  \nNet earnings - GAAP  |  $  |  38,683  |  $  |  53,254   \nIncome taxes  |  14,205  |  19,385   \nInterest expense, net  |  24,486  |  26,148   \nLosses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants  |  254  |  (3,825  |  )   \nOther operating expenses (income), net (1)  |  5,170  |  (5,501  |  )   \nDepreciation and amortization  |  18,473  |  19,402   \nAmortization of cloud-computing costs (2)  |  1,606  |  1,562   \nAmortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net  |  124  |  533   \nAmortization of franchise tenant improvement allowances and other  |  1,511  |  1,216   \nNet COLI gains (3)  |  $  |  (4,834  |  )  |  (5,724  |  )   \nPension and post-retirement benefit costs (4)  |  $  |  2,106  |  2,144   \nAdjusted EBITDA – non-GAAP  |  $  |  101,784  |  $  |  108,594   \n____________________________   \n---  \n(1)  |  Other operating expense (income), net includes: acquisition, integration and strategic initiatives; costs of closed restaurants; operating restaurant impairment charges; accelerated depreciation and gains/losses on disposition of property and equipment, net.   \n(2)  |  Amortization of cloud computing costs includes the amounts for the non-cash amortization of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud-based software arrangements that are included within selling, general and administrative expenses.   \n(3)  |  Net COLI gains reflect market-based adjustments on the company-owned life insurance policies, net of changes in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies.   \n(4)  |  Pension and post-retirement benefit costs relating to our two legacy defined benefit pension plans, as well as the two legacy post-retirement plans.   \n  \n**_Restaurant-Level Margin_ **\n\nRestaurant-Level Margin is defined as company restaurant sales less restaurant operating costs (food and packaging, labor, and occupancy costs) and is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. Restaurant-Level Margin excludes revenues and expenses of our franchise operations and certain costs, such as selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, other operating expenses (income), net, losses (gains) on the sale of company-operated restaurants, and other costs that are considered normal operating costs. As such, Restaurant-Level Margin is not indicative of the overall results of the company and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Restaurant-Level Margin should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Franchise-Level Margin excludes revenue and expenses of our company-operated restaurants and certain costs, such as selling, general, and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, other operating expenses (income), net, and other costs that are considered normal operating costs. As such, Franchise-Level Margin is not indicative of the overall results of the company and does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders because of the exclusion of corporate-level expenses. Franchise-Level Margin should be considered as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, analysis of results as reported under GAAP or other similarly titled measures of other companies. The company is presenting Franchise-Level Margin because it believes that it provides a meaningful supplement to net earnings of the company's core business operating results, as well as a comparison to those of other similar companies.

Del Taco is a nationwide operator and franchisor of restaurants featuring fresh and fast Mexican and American inspired\ncuisines.\nAs of January 21, 2024, there were 144 company-operated and 2,048 franchise-operated Jack in the Box restaurants and 179 company-operated and 413\nfranchise-operated Del Taco restaurants.\nReferences to the Company throughout these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements are made using the first person notations of “we,” “us” and\n“our.”\nBasis of presentation — The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted\naccounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nThese financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in the Company’s Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (“2023 Form 10-K”). The accounting policies used in preparing these condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements are the same as those described in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nIn our opinion, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial condition and results of operations for these interim periods have been\nincluded. Operating results for one interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for any other interim period or for the full year.\nFiscal year — The Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal year\nending the Tuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s fiscal\n2024 results include two fewer days. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 include 52 weeks. Our first quarter includes 16 weeks and all other quarters include 12 weeks.\nAll comparisons between 2024 and 2023 refer to the 16 weeks (“quarter”) and 16 weeks (year-to-date”) ended January 21, 2024 and January 22, 2023,\nrespectively, unless otherwise indicated.\nUse of estimates — In preparing the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make certain\nassumptions and estimates that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. In making these\nassumptions and estimates, management may from time to time seek advice and consider information provided by actuaries and other experts in a particular\narea. Actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates.\nAdvertising costs — The Company administers marketing funds at each of its restaurant brands that include contractual contributions. In 2024 and 2023,\nmarketing fund contributions from Jack in the Box franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 5.0% of sales, and marketing fund\ncontributions from Del Taco franchise and company-operated restaurants were approximately 4.0% of sales. Year-to-date incremental contributions made by\nthe Company for both brands were $0.2 million and less than $0.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTotal contributions made by the Company are included in “Selling, general, and administrative expenses” in the accompanying condensed consolidated\nstatements of earnings and for the quarter totaled $10.4 million and $12.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAllowance for credit losses — The Company closely monitors the financial condition of our franchisees and estimates the allowance for credit losses based on\nthe lifetime expected loss on receivables. These estimates are based on historical collection experience with our franchisees as well as other factors, including\ncurrent market conditions and events. Credit quality is monitored through the timing of payments compared to predefined aging criteria and known facts\nregarding the financial condition of the franchisee or customer. Account balances are charged off against the allowance after recovery efforts have ceased.\n7\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nBalance as of beginning of period $ (4,146) $ (5,975)\n(Provision) reversal for expected credit losses (21) 1,445\nBalance as of end of period $ (4,167) $ (4,530)\nBusiness combinations — The Company accounts for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired, including the\namount assigned to identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill and trademarks — Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, if any. We generally record\ngoodwill in connection with the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees or the acquisition of another business. Likewise, upon the sale of restaurants to\nfranchisees, goodwill is decremented. The amount of goodwill written-off is determined as the fair value of the business disposed of as a percentage of the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit prior to the disposal. If the business disposed of was never fully integrated into the reporting unit after its acquisition, and thus the\nbenefits of the acquired goodwill were never realized, the current carrying amount of the acquired goodwill is written off.\nGoodwill is not amortized and has been assigned to reporting units for purposes of impairment testing. The Company’s two restaurant brands, Jack in the Box\nand Del Taco, are both operating segments and reporting units. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by determining whether the fair value of our reporting\nunits exceed their carrying values.\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant. The\nCompany performs this testing during the third quarter of each year.\nOur impairment analyses first includes a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Significant factors considered in this assessment include, but are not limited to, macro-economic\nconditions, market and industry conditions, cost considerations, the competitive environment, share price fluctuations, overall financial performance, and\nresults of past impairment tests. If the qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value, we perform a\nquantitative impairment test.\nRecent accounting pronouncements — The Company reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not\napplicable or not expected to have a significant impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\n2. REVENUE\nNature of products and services — The Company derives revenue from retail sales at Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated restaurants and rental\nrevenue, royalties, advertising, and franchise and other fees from franchise-operated restaurants.\nOur franchise arrangements generally provide for an initial franchise fee per restaurant for a 20-year term, and generally require that franchisees pay royalty\nand marketing fees based upon a percentage of gross sales. The agreements also require franchisees to pay technology fees, as well as sourcing fees for Jack in\nthe Box franchise agreements.\nDisaggregation of revenue — The following table disaggregates revenue by segment and primary source for the quarter ended January 21, 2024 (in\nthousands):\nJack in the Box Del Taco Total\nCompany restaurant sales $ 132,057 $ 91,983 $ 224,040\nFranchise rental revenues 105,578 7,618 113,196\nFranchise royalties 61,323 9,454 70,777\nMarketing fees 61,220 7,731 68,951\nTechnology and sourcing fees 6,142 1,839 7,981\nFranchise fees and other services 2,020 533 2,553\nTotal revenue $ 368,340 $ 119,158 $ 487,498\n8\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by segment and primary source for the quarter ended January 22, 2023 (in thousands):\nJack in the Box Del Taco Total\nCompany restaurant sales $ 126,142 $ 144,049 $ 270,191\nFranchise rental revenues 106,096 2,734 108,830\nFranchise royalties 67,569 6,934 74,503\nMarketing fees 60,344 5,654 65,998\nTechnology and sourcing fees 4,969 718 5,687\nFranchise fees and other services 1,797 90 1,887\nTotal revenue $ 366,917 $ 160,179 $ 527,096\nIn October 2022, a Jack in the Box franchise operator paid the Company $7.3 million in order to sell his restaurants to a new franchisee at the current standard\nroyalty rate, which is lower than the royalty rate in the existing franchise agreements. The payment represented the difference between the existing royalty rate\nand the new royalty rate based on projected future sales for the remaining term of the existing agreements. The payment was non-refundable and not subject to\nany adjustments based on actual future sales. The Company determined the transaction represented the termination of the existing agreement rather than the\ntransfer of an agreement between franchisees. As such, the $7.3 million was recognized in franchise royalty revenue during the first quarter of 2023.\nContract liabilities — Contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue resulting from initial franchise and development fees received from franchisees for new\nrestaurant openings or new franchise terms, which are recognized over the franchise term. The Company classifies these contract liabilities as “Accrued\nliabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities” in our condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nA summary of significant changes in contract liabilities is presented below (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nDeferred franchise and development fees at beginning of period $ 50,474 $ 46,449\nRevenue recognized (1,988) (1,639)\nAdditions 1,597 2,240\nDeferred franchise and development fees at end of period $ 50,083 $ 47,050\nAs of January 21, 2024, approximately $8.0 million of development fees related to unopened restaurants are included in deferred revenue. Timing of revenue\nrecognition for development fees related to unopened restaurants is dependent upon the timing of restaurant openings and are recognized over the franchise\nterm at the date of opening.\nThe following table reflects the estimated franchise fees to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of January 21,\n2024 (in thousands):\nRemainder of 2024 $ 3,626\n2025 5,052\n2026 4,721\n2027 4,377\n2028 3,748\nThereafter 20,570\n$ 42,094\nThe Company has applied the optional exemption, as provided for under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which allows us to not\ndisclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the transaction price is a sales-based royalty.\n9\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

These amounts relate to i) company-owned restaurants to be refranchised, ii) operating\nrestaurant properties which we intend to sell to franchisees and/or sell and leaseback with a third party, and iii) closed restaurant properties which we are\nmarketing for sale.\n4. FRANCHISE ACQUISITIONS\nFranchise acquisitions — During the first quarter of 2024, the Company acquired 9 Del Taco franchise restaurants for $86 thousand as part of two separate\ntransactions, and recognized related gains of $2.4 million.

LEASES\nNature of leases — The Company owns restaurant sites and also leases restaurant sites from third parties. Some of these owned or leased sites are leased\nand/or subleased to franchisees. Initial terms of our real estate leases are generally 20 years, exclusive of options to renew, which are generally exercisable at\nour sole discretion for 1 to 20 years. In some instances, our leases have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined revenues. Many of\nour restaurants also have rent escalation clauses and require the payment of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Variable lease costs include\ncontingent rent, cost-of-living index adjustments, and payments for additional rent such as real estate taxes, insurance, and common area maintenance, which\nare excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.\nAs lessor, our leases and subleases primarily consist of restaurants that have been leased to franchisees in connection with refranchising transactions. Revenues\nfrom leasing arrangements with our franchisees are presented in “Franchise rental revenues” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of\nearnings, and the related expenses are presented in “Franchise occupancy expenses.”\n11\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

However, on an\nannual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable, non-financial instruments are assessed\nfor impairment. If applicable, the carrying values are written down to fair value.\nIn connection with our impairment reviews performed during 2024, the Company impaired certain Del Taco assets held for sale.

In 2023, gains on\ndisposition of property and equipment primarily related to the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the properties from us prior\nto the sale.\n9. SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company’s principal business consists of developing, operating and franchising our Jack in the Box and Del Taco restaurant brands, each of which is\nconsidered a reportable operating segment. In 2024, our chief operating decision maker revised the method by which they determine performance and strategy\nfor our segments. This change was made to reflect a shared-services model whereby each brand’s results of operations are assessed separately and do not\ninclude costs related to certain corporate functions which support both brands. This segment reporting structure reflects the Company’s current management\nstructure, internal reporting method and financial information used in deciding how to allocate Company resources. Based upon certain quantitative thresholds,\neach operating segment is considered a reportable segment. This change to our segment reporting did not change our reporting units for goodwill.\nThe Company measures and evaluates our segments based on segment revenues and segment profit. The reportable segments do not include an allocation of\nthe costs related to shared service functions, such as accounting/finance, human resources, audit services, legal, tax and treasury; nor do they include certain\nunallocated costs such share-based compensation. These costs are reflected in the caption “Shared services and unallocated costs.”\nOur measure of segment profit excludes depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, company-owned life insurance (“COLI”) gains, net of\nchanges in our non-qualified deferred compensation obligation supported by these policies, acquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives, losses (gains) on\nthe sale of company-operated restaurants, gains on acquisition of restaurants, and amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and subleases, net.\n13\nJACK IN THE BOX INC.

INCOME TAXES\nThe income tax provisions reflect a year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.9% in 2024, as compared to 26.7% in fiscal year 2023. The major component of the\nyear-over-year increase in tax rates was an increase in the impact of non-deductible officers’ compensation.\n11. RETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined benefit pension plans — The Company sponsors two defined benefit pension plans, a frozen “Qualified Plan” covering substantially all full-time\nemployees hired prior to January 1, 2011, and an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) which provides certain employees additional\npension benefits and was closed to new participants effective January 1, 2007. Benefits under both plans are based on the employee’s years of service and\ncompensation over defined periods of employment.\nPost-retirement healthcare plans — The Company also sponsors two healthcare plans, closed to new participants, that provide post-retirement medical\nbenefits to certain employees who have met minimum age and service requirements. The plans are contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted annually,\nand they contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.\n14\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit) — The components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) in each period were as follows (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nDefined benefit pension plans:\nInterest cost $ 5,839 $ 5,913\nExpected return on plan assets (4,609) (4,648)\nActuarial losses (1) 933 944\nAmortization of unrecognized prior service costs (1) 5 6\nNet periodic benefit cost $ 2,168 $ 2,215\nPost-retirement healthcare plans:\nInterest cost $ 219 $ 215\nActuarial gains (1) (281) (286)\nNet periodic benefit credit $ (62) $ (71)\n____________________________\n(1) Amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into net earnings as a component of “Other pension and post-retirement expenses, net.”\nFuture cash flows — The Company’s policy is to fund our plans at or above the minimum required by law. As of the date of our last actuarial funding\nvaluation, there was no minimum contribution funding requirement for the Qualified Plan. Details regarding 2024 contributions are as follows (in thousands):\nPost-Retirement\nSERP Healthcare Plans\nNet year-to-date contributions $ 1,310 $ 388\nRemaining estimated net contributions during fiscal 2024 $ 3,828 $ 717\nThe Company continues to evaluate contributions to our Qualified Plan based on changes in pension assets as a result of asset performance in the current\nmarket and the economic environment. The Company does not anticipate making any contributions to our Qualified Plan in fiscal 2024.\n12. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK\nRepurchases of common stock — The Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of its common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for an aggregate cost of\n$25.2 million, including applicable excise tax. As of January 21, 2024, there was $225.0 million remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by the\nBoard of Directors which do not expire.\nDividends — During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per common share totaling $8.7 million. Future\ndividends are subject to approval by our Board of Directors.\n15\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n13. WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING\nThe following table reconciles basic weighted-average shares outstanding to diluted weighted-average shares outstanding (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nWeighted-average shares outstanding – basic 19,893 20,921\nEffect of potentially dilutive securities:\nNonvested stock awards and units 145 79\nPerformance share awards 13 —\nWeighted-average shares outstanding – diluted 20,051 21,000\nExcluded from diluted weighted-average shares outstanding:\nAntidilutive 24 23\nPerformance conditions not satisfied at the end of the period 136 112\n14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal matters — The Company assesses contingencies, including litigation contingencies, to determine the degree of probability and range of possible loss for\npotential accrual in our financial statements. An estimated loss contingency is accrued in the financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 21, 2024, the Company had accruals of $15.4 million for all of its legal matters\nin aggregate, presented within “Accrued liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, assessing contingencies is\nhighly subjective and requires judgments about future events. When evaluating litigation contingencies, we may be unable to provide a meaningful estimate\ndue to a number of factors, including the procedural status of the matter in question, the availability of appellate remedies, insurance coverage related to the\nclaim or claims in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the\nmatter. In addition, damage amounts claimed in litigation against us may be unsupported, exaggerated, or unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not\nmeaningful indicators of our potential liability or financial exposure. The Company regularly reviews contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals\nand related disclosures. The ultimate amount of loss may differ from these estimates. Any estimate is not an indication of expected loss, if any, or of the\nCompany’s maximum possible loss exposure and the ultimate amount of loss may differ materially from these estimates in the near term.\nGessele v. Jack in the Box Inc. — In August 2010, five former Jack in the Box employees instituted litigation in federal court in Oregon alleging claims under\nthe federal Fair Labor Standards Act and Oregon wage and hour laws. The plaintiffs alleged that Jack in the Box failed to pay non-exempt employees for\ncertain meal breaks and improperly made payroll deductions for shoe purchases and for workers’ compensation expenses, and later added additional claims\nrelating to timing of final pay and related wage and hour claims involving employees of a franchisee. In 2016, the court dismissed the federal claims and those\nrelating to franchise employees. In June 2017, the court granted class certification with respect to state law claims of improper deductions and late payment of\nfinal wages. The parties participated in a voluntary mediation on March 16, 2020, but the matter did not settle. On October 24, 2022, a jury awarded plaintiffs\napproximately $6.4 million in damages and penalties. The Company continues to dispute liability and the damage award and will defend against both through\npost-trial motions and all other available appellate remedies. As of January 21, 2024, the Company has accrued the verdict amount above, as well as estimated\npre-judgment and post-judgment interest and an estimated fee award, for an additional $8.6 million. These amounts are included within “Accrued liabilities” on\nour condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company will continue to accrue for post-judgment interest until the matter is resolved.\nTorrez — In March 2014, a former Del Taco employee filed a purported Private Attorneys General Act claim and class action alleging various causes of action\nunder California’s labor, wage, and hour laws. The plaintiff generally alleges Del Taco did not appropriately provide meal and rest breaks and failed to pay\nwages and reimburse business expenses to its California non-exempt employees. On November 12, 2021, the court granted, in part, the plaintiff's motion for\nclass certification. The parties participated in voluntary mediation on May 24, 2022 and June 3, 2022. On June 4, 2022, we entered into a Settlement\nMemorandum of Understanding which obligated the Company to pay a gross settlement amount of $50.0 million, for which in exchange we will be released\nfrom all claims by the parties. On August 8, 2023, the court issued its final approval of the settlement and on August 9, 2023 final judgement was entered. The\nCompany made its first payment of half of the settlement amount on August 28, 2023. Payment of the second half was made on November 27, 2023. As of\nJanuary 21, 2024, the Company does not have any further amounts accrued on our condensed consolidated balance sheet for this matter.\n16\nJACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\nJ&D Restaurant Group — On April 17, 2019, the trustee for a bankrupt former franchisee filed a complaint generally alleging the Company wrongfully\nterminated the franchise agreements and unreasonably denied two perspective purchasers the former franchisee presented. The parties participated in a\nmediation in April 2021, and again in December 2022, but the matter did not settle. Trial commenced on January 9, 2023. On February 8, 2023, the jury\nreturned a verdict finding the Company had not breached any contracts in terminating the franchise agreements or denying the proposed buyers. However,\nwhile the jury also found the Company had not violated the California Unfair Practices Act, it found for the plaintiff on the claim for breach of implied\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing, and awarded $8.0 million in damages. On May 9, 2023, the court granted the Company’s post-trial motion, overturning\nthe jury verdict and ordering the plaintiff take nothing on its claims. As a result, the Company reversed the prior $8.0 million accrual, and as of January 21,\n2024, the Company has no amounts accrued for this case on its condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Plaintiff has appealed the trial court’s post-trial\nrulings.\nOther legal matters — In addition to the matters described above, we are subject to normal and routine litigation brought by former or current employees,\ncustomers, franchisees, vendors, landlords, shareholders, or others. We intend to defend ourselves in any such matters. Some of these matters may be covered,\nat least in part, by insurance or other third-party indemnity obligation. We record receivables from third party insurers when recovery has been determined to be\nprobable.\nLease guarantees — We remain contingently liable for certain leases relating to our former Qdoba business which we sold in fiscal 2018. Under the Qdoba\nPurchase Agreement, the buyer has indemnified the Company of all claims related to these guarantees. As of January 21, 2024, the maximum potential liability\nof future undiscounted payments under these leases is approximately $21.8 million. The lease terms extend for a maximum of approximately 14 more years and\nwe would remain a guarantor of the leases in the event the leases are extended for any established renewal periods. In the event of default, we believe the\nexposure is limited due to contractual protections and recourse available in the lease agreements, as well as the Qdoba Purchase Agreement, including a\nrequirement of the landlord to mitigate damages by re-letting the properties in default, and indemnity from the Buyer. The Company has not recorded a liability\nfor these guarantees as we believe the likelihood of making any future payments is remote.\n15.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe Company’s fiscal year is 52 or 53 weeks ending the Sunday closest to September 30. In fiscal 2023, Del Taco operated on a fiscal year ending the\nTuesday closest to September 30. Beginning fiscal 2024, Del Taco’s fiscal year shifted to align with Jack in the Box. As a result, Del Taco’s fiscal 2024 results\ninclude two fewer days. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 include 52 weeks. Our first quarter includes 16 weeks and all other quarters include 12 weeks. All\ncomparisons between 2024 and 2023 refer to the 16 weeks (“quarter”) and 16 weeks (“year-to-date”) ended January 21, 2024 and January 22, 2023,\nrespectively, unless otherwise indicated.\nFor an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during 2024 and 2023, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related\nnotes included in this Quarterly Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nOur MD&A consists of the following sections:\n• Overview — a general description of our business.\n• Results of operations — an analysis of our condensed consolidated statements of earnings for the periods presented in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n• Liquidity and capital resources — an analysis of our cash flows, including capital expenditures, share repurchase activity, dividends, and known\ntrends that may impact liquidity.\n• Discussion of critical accounting estimates — a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n• New accounting pronouncements — a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, dates of implementation and the impact on our consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations, if any.\n• Cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements — a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to\ndiffer materially from any forward-looking statements made by management.\nWe have included in our MD&A certain performance metrics that management uses to assess company performance and which we believe will be useful\nin analyzing and understanding our results of operations. These metrics include:\n• Changes in sales at restaurants open more than one year (“same-store sales”), systemwide sales, franchised restaurant sales, and average unit volumes\n(“AUVs”). Same-store sales, restaurant sales, and AUVs are presented for franchised restaurants and on a system-wide basis, which includes company\nand franchise restaurants. Franchise sales represent sales at franchise restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees. We do not record franchise sales\nas revenues; however, our royalty revenues, marketing fees and percentage rent revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise sales. We\nbelieve franchise and system same-store sales, franchised and system restaurant sales, and AUV information are useful to investors as they have a\ndirect effect on the Company’s profitability.\nSame-store sales, systemwide sales, franchised restaurant sales, and AUVs are not measurements determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be\nconsidered in isolation, or as an alternative to earnings from operations, or other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nOVERVIEW\nOur Business\nFounded in 1951, Jack in the Box Inc. (the “Company”) operates and franchises Jack in the Box® and Del Taco® quick-service restaurants. As of\nJanuary 21, 2024, we operated and franchised 2,192 Jack in the Box quick-service restaurants, primarily in the western and southern United States, including\ntwo in Guam, and 592 Del Taco quick-service restaurants across 16 states.\nWe derive revenue from retail sales at company-operated restaurants and rental revenue, royalties (based upon a percent of sales), franchise fees and\ncontributions for advertising and other services from franchisees.\n19\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following tables summarize changes in same-store sales for Jack in the Box and Del Taco company-operated, franchised, and system restaurants:\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023\nCompany 2.0 % 12.6 %\nFranchise 0.7 % 7.4 %\nSystem 0.8 % 7.8 %\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\nDel Taco: 2024 2023\nCompany 1.8 % 3.1 %\nFranchise 2.4 % 2.8 %\nSystem 2.2 % 3.0 %\nThe following tables summarize year-to-date changes in the number and mix of company and franchise restaurants for our two brands:\n2024 2023\nJack in the Box: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 142 2,044 2,186 146 2,035 2,181\nNew 2 5 7 — 6 6\nRefranchised — — — (5) 5 —\nClosed — (1) (1) (1) — (1)\nEnd of period 144 2,048 2,192 140 2,046 2,186\n% of system 7 % 93 % 100 % 6 % 94 % 100 %\n2024 2023\nDel Taco: Company Franchise Total Company Franchise Total\nBeginning of year 171 421 592 290 301 591\nNew — 3 3 — 2 2\nAcquired from franchisees 9 (9) — — — —\nRefranchised — — — (16) 16 —\nClosed (1) (2) (3) (1) — (1)\nEnd of period 179 413 592 273 319 592\n% of system 30 % 70 % 100 % 46 % 54 % 100 %\n20\nThe following tables summarize restaurant sales for company-operated, franchised, and systemwide sales for our two brands (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\nJack in the Box: 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 132,057 $ 126,142\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 1,226,750 1,208,983\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 1,358,807 $ 1,335,125\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\nDel Taco: 2024 2023\nCompany-operated restaurant sales $ 91,983 $ 144,049\nFranchised restaurant sales (1) 198,476 146,098\nSystemwide sales (1) $ 290,459 $ 290,147\n____________________________\n(1) Franchised restaurant sales represent sales at franchised restaurants and are revenues of our franchisees.

Refer to Note 14,\nCommitments and Contingencies, in the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the legal matters.\nOther Operating Expenses (Income), Net\nOther operating expenses (income), net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nAcquisition, integration, and strategic initiatives $ 5,621 $ 1,651\nCosts of closed restaurants and other 858 2,589\nAccelerated depreciation 37 268\nGains on acquisition of restaurants (2,357) —\nLosses (gains) on disposition of property and equipment, net 1,011 (10,009)\n$ 5,170 $ (5,501)\nOther operating expenses (income), net increased $10.7 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the $9.5 million of gains recognized in the\nprior year from the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees who were leasing the properties from us prior to the sale, partially offset by $3.7\nmillion of additional consulting fees for strategic initiatives in the current year, as well as the $2.4 million purchase gains related to the acquisition of 9 Del Taco\nrestaurants in the current year.\nGains and Losses on the Sale of Company-Operated Restaurants\nFor the quarter-to-date period 2024, the net loss on the sale of company-operated restaurants of $0.3 million relates to a $2.2 million impairment of assets\nheld for sale related to a Del Taco refranchising transaction that is expected to close in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by additional proceeds\nreceived in connection with the extension of franchise agreements from the sale of restaurants in prior years.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, the Company sold five Jack in the Box company-operated restaurants and 16 Del Taco company-operated restaurants to\nfranchisees, for which the Company recognized a net gain on the sale of company-operated restaurants of $3.8 million.\nRefer to Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings and Assets Held for Sale, of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding these transactions.\n25\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net is comprised of the following (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nInterest expense $ 25,363 $ 26,537\nInterest income (877) (389)\nInterest expense, net $ 24,486 $ 26,148\nInterest expense, net, decreased $1.7 million primarily due to lower average borrowings resulting in a decrease of $1.2 million in interest expense\ncompared to the prior year. Additionally, there was an increase in interest income of $0.5 million in the current year due to higher investment balances\ncompared to fiscal year 2023.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe income tax provisions reflect a year-to-date effective tax rate of 26.9% in 2024, as compared to 26.7% in fiscal year 2023. The major component of\nthe year-over-year increase in tax rates was an increase in the impact of non-deductible officers’ compensation.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our credit\nfacilities. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service\nrequirements, franchise tenant improvement allowance and incentive distributions, dividend payments, and obligations related to our benefit plans. We\ngenerally use available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, pay dividends and repurchase shares of our common\nstock.\nAs of January 21, 2024, the Company had $82.5 million of cash and restricted cash on its consolidated balance sheet and available borrowings of $175.5\nmillion under our $150.0 million Variable Funding Notes and our $75.0 million revolving credit facility. The Company continually assesses the optimal sources\nand uses of cash for our business. We review our balance sheet for any undervalued assets and pursue opportunities for capital sources, including the sale of our\nowned Jack in the Box properties and refranchising, primarily for Del Taco in the near term.\nBased upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing\nfacility and revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve\nmonths and the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nThe table below summarizes our cash flows from continuing operations (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nTotal cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ (22,675) $ 62,472\nInvesting activities (36,574) 15,684\nFinancing activities (44,124) (32,578)\nNet cash flows $ (103,373) $ 45,578\nOperating Activities. Operating cash flows decreased $85.1 million compared with a year ago. This is primarily due to an unfavorable change in working\ncapital of $79.5 million, as well as lower net income, when adjusted for non-cash items, of $5.7 million. The change in working capital is primarily a result of\nthe payment of $50.3 million of fiscal 2023 income tax payments deferred in connection with the Southern California winter storm disaster area declaration,\nthe final payment of the Torrez litigation of $25.5 million, and an increase bonus payments of $15.3 million. These decreases in cash were partially offset by an\nincrease in the advertising accruals of $17.5 million.\n26\nInvesting Activities. Cash flows from investing activities decreased by $52.3 million compared with a year ago due to higher purchases of property and\nequipment of $14.8 million, lower proceeds in the current year from the sale of Jack in the Box restaurant properties to franchisees of $21.6 million, and lower\nproceeds from the sale of company-operated restaurants of $15.9 million.\nCapital Expenditures — The composition of capital expenditures in each period follows (in thousands):\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nRestaurants:\nRemodel / refresh programs $ 3,240 $ 3,473\nRestaurant facility expenditures 12,269 9,046\nPurchases of assets intended for sale 11,910 3,497\nPurchase of land 2,144 —\nRestaurant information technology 5,212 5,906\n34,775 21,922\nCorporate Services:\nInformation technology 3,991 1,877\nCorporate facilities 63 229\n4,054 2,106\nTotal capital expenditures $ 38,829 $ 24,028\nThe increase in restaurant facility expenditures includes amounts spent on capital maintenance and other operational initiatives. The increase for the\npurchases of assets intended for sale and/or sale and leaseback includes amounts spent on exercising our right of first refusal to purchase land and building\nwhich we intend to sell and leaseback. The increase for corporate information technology includes spending in connection with our new enterprise resource\nplanning system and digital workflow platform.\nSale of Company-Operated Restaurants — The following table details proceeds received in connection with our refranchising activities in each period\n(dollars in thousands).\nSixteen Weeks Ended\nJanuary 21, January 22,\n2024 2023\nNumber of Jack in the Box restaurants sold to franchisees — 5\nNumber of Del Taco restaurants sold to franchisees — 16\nTotal proceeds $ 1,739 $ 17,609\nFor further information, see Note 3, Summary of Refranchisings and Assets Held for Sale, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nFinancing Activities. Cash flows from financing activities decreased by $11.5 million compared with a year ago. The change is primarily due to a $10.0\nmillion increase in stock repurchases in the current year versus the prior year.\nRepurchases of common stock — The Company repurchased 0.3 million shares of its common stock in fiscal 2024 for an aggregate cost of $25.2 million.\nAs of January 21, 2024, there was $225.0 million remaining under share repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors which do not expire.\nDividends — Up through January 21, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per common share totaling $8.7 million.\nOn February 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.44 per share, to be paid on March 27, 2024, to shareholders of record as of\nthe close of business on March 15, 2024.\n27\nSecuritized Refinancing Transaction — On February 11, 2022, the Company completed the sale of $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 3.445% Fixed Rate\nSenior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) and $550.0 million of its Series 2022-1 4.136% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II\n(the “Class A-2-II Notes” and, together with the Class A-2-I Notes, the “2022 Notes”). Interest payments on the 2022 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis.\nThe anticipated repayment dates of the 2022 Class A-2-I Notes and the Class A-2-II Notes will be February 2027 and February 2032, respectively, unless\nearlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the indenture that governs the 2022 Notes. The anticipated repayment dates of the existing 2019-1 Class A-2-II\nNotes and the Class A-2-III Notes are August 2026 and August 2029, respectively.\nThe Company also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes (the “Variable Funding Notes”),\nwhich permits borrowings up to a maximum of $150.0 million, subject to certain borrowing conditions, a portion of which may be used to issue letters of\ncredit. As of January 21, 2024, we did not have any outstanding borrowings and had available borrowing capacity of $100.5 million under our Variable\nFunding Notes, net of letters of credits issued of $49.5 million.\nThe 2022 Notes were issued in a privately placed securitization transaction pursuant to which certain of the Company’s revenue-generating assets,\nconsisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are\nheld by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as Guarantors of\nthe Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets, excluding certain real estate assets and subject to certain limitations, to secure the Notes. The\n2022 Notes are subject to the same covenants and restrictions as the Series 2019-1 Notes.\nThe quarterly principal payment on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to\nearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as defined in the Indenture), is less than or equal to 5.0x. Exceeding\nthe leverage ratio of 5.0x does not violate any covenant related to the Class A-2 Notes. Subsequent to closing the issuance of the 2022 Notes, the Company has\nhad a leverage ratio of greater than 5.0x and, accordingly, the Company resumed making the scheduled amortization payments on its 2022 Notes and Series\n2019-1 Notes beginning in the second quarter of 2022.\nRestricted cash — In accordance with the terms of the Indenture, certain cash accounts have been established with the Indenture trustee for the benefit of\nthe note holders and are restricted in their use. As of January 21, 2024, the Company had restricted cash of $28.6 million, which primarily represented cash\ncollections and cash reserves held by the trustee to be used for payments of interest and commitment fees required for the Class A-1 and A-2 Notes.\nCovenants and restrictions — The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the\nMaster Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and\nmandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under\ncertain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways\ndefective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid\namortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of gross sales for\nspecified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay\nor refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events\nrelating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain\ntime frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.\nAs of January 21, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenant requirements and were not subject to any rapid amortization events.\nRevolving credit facility — In connection with the Del Taco acquisition, Del Taco’s existing debt related to a Syndicated Credit Facility dated August 5,\n2015, was repaid and extinguished on the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Del Taco entered into a new syndicated credit facility with an aggregate principal\namount of up to $75.0 million, which matures on March 1, 2024. The revolving credit facility, as amended, includes a limit of $20.0 million for letters of credit,\nall of which were cancelled as of October 1, 2023. As of January 21, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings and available borrowing capacity of\n$75.0 million under the facility.\n28\nDISCUSSION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nCritical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are most important for the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results,\nand that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in\nmaterially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions. There have been no material changes to the critical\naccounting policies and estimates previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
