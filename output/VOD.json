Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and Xiaomi continued their innovative streak with the successful test in Germany and Spain of a new 5G technology capable of download speeds close to 1.8 gigabits-per-second (Gbps) using a new smartphone.\n\nSpecifically, they tested enhanced technology which improves the way data and video is transmitted from the radio network over 5G to a customer’s mobile device. Called 1024 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), it is a step up from today’s system (256 QAM) since it packs together more data into each transmission, leading to faster download speeds. \n\nThis increase in speed and data throughout will ultimately lead to greater network capacity, freeing up additional bandwidth at mobile sites to improve the overall experience for customers.\n\n#### 1.8 Gbps Peak Speed \n\nUsing Xiaomi’s smartphone, the Xiaomi 14 Ultra, equipped with its latest Snapdragon® X75 5G Modem-RF System, Vodafone engineers recorded excellent results. In Germany, the team measured a throughput improvement on the commercial network of around 20% over a distance of up to 600 meters, and at its 5G test centre in Ciudad Real, Spain, they achieved peak 5G download speed of nearly 1.8 Gbps. Theoretically, 1.8 Gbps could provide a capacity gain of up to 25% in ideal conditions. \n\nThe technology, which Vodafone expects to become more widely available during 2025, is suited to supporting multiple customers close to a mobile site in busy areas such as a shopping centre or high street.\n\n#### Wave of Innovation\n\nAlberto Ripepi, Chief Network Officer of Vodafone, said: “Vodafone is at the forefront of the next wave of innovation in 5G. Our customers will benefit from a head start when the next generation smartphones become more widely available, and we can offer our technical expertise to partners and other providers through our new commercial model.”\n\nDino Flore, Vice President, Technology of Qualcomm Europe, Inc. added: “The successful trials conducted in Germany and Spain with Vodafone and Xiaomi are proof that we are continuing to push the boundaries of what is possible with 5G technology.”\n\nGuoquan Zhang, General Manager of Xiaomi Software Department, said: “We are honored to have collaborated with Vodafone and Qualcomm on this achievement. It demonstrates how Xiaomi is actively driving and showing innovation in the 5G space.”\n\nThis latest technological breakthrough follows news earlier this year that the same three companies achieved upload speeds of up to 273 megabits-per-second (Mbps) using another innovative technology. This is more than double the average uplink speed of today’s smartphones and home broadband services. \n\n#### Efficiency Gains \n\nIndustry body 3GPP has defined the 1024 QAM technology, helping operators make further efficiency gains using existing spectrum whilst providing greater speeds for customers even among bandwidth-hungry digital services. \n\nFor the test, Vodafone engineers used 1024 QAM with a Time Division Duplexing (TDD) spectrum band – a way to send and receive data within pre-determined time slots on the same frequency (3.5 GHz in this instance). 3.5 GHz spectrum can benefit from 1024 GAM because it has been widely assigned for 5G and associated mobile broadband applications. Vodafone will continue to test drive 1024 QAM-compatible networking equipment and devices ahead of their commercial deployment later. \n\n_Snapdragon and Qualcomm branded products are products of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.Qualcomm and Snapdragon are trademarks or registered trademarks of Qualcomm Incorporated._\n\n  * 5G\n\n  * Connectivity\n\n  * Consumers\n\n  * Europe\n\n  * Future of Connectivity\n\n  * Infrastructure\n\n  * Innovation\n\n  * Networks\n\n  * Partnerships\n\n  * Technology\n\n\n\n\n## More stories\n\nLoading...\n\nYour Cookies \n\nWe use cookies, including from our partners, to enhance and personalise your experience.

email\n\n\n\n2 minute read\n\nVodafone today announced that SuperTOBi, its new customer-focussed Generative AI (GenAI) driven virtual assistant, is being rolled out across Europe.\n\nSuperTOBi, powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI, can understand and respond faster to complex customer enquiries better than traditional chatbots. It has been introduced in Italy and Portugal and will start serving customers in Germany and Turkey from this month. Other markets will follow later this year.\n\nThe online chat service is the next generation of Vodafone’s existing chatbot called TOBi, which is already supporting customers in 13 countries across Europe and Africa and understands 11 different languages. SuperTOBi is a key initiative in Vodafone’s wide-reaching transformation of the customer experience, all of which is underpinned by a reallocated investment of €140 million this financial year.\n\nSuperTOBi can interpret entire sentences and phrases, overcoming the limitations of existing chatbot technologies which typically can answer only simple questions based on a few key words. It also engages in more natural conversation with customers for a more personalised experience, rather than one- or two-word answers, and it will automatically transfer a question it can’t answer to a person that can.\n\nCustomers of Vodafone Portugal are already benefitting from SuperTOBi when booking appointments. As a result, the first-time resolution rate has increased from 15% to 60% and Vodafone’s online net promoter scores (where respondents are asked to rate their experience) improved by 14 points to 64 points – anything above 50 points is considered a strong result. Other customer journeys such as billing are also being added.\n\nSuperTOBi is complemented by an enhanced bot assistant used by Vodafone’s own customer care employees, called SuperAgent, as well as an improved search facility on Vodafone’s customer-facing websites called SuperSearch.\n\nBased on Microsoft Azure OpenAI’s Agent Copilot solution, SuperAgent helps human agents to quickly search and locate answers to complex queries or multiple questions. In Ireland, SuperAgent is assisting agents by sending a summary of its online customer conversation to the agent, so customers don’t need to repeat themselves. It also only uses information from Vodafone’s companywide and private knowledge database, ensuring that the information is more reliable than public sources.\n\n  * AI\n\n  * Consumers\n\n  * Europe\n\n  * Innovation\n\n  * Mobile\n\n\n\n\n## More stories\n\nLoading...\n\nYour Cookies \n\nWe use cookies, including from our partners, to enhance and personalise your experience.

businesses think they do – by an average margin of 11 percentage points – creating the “Trust Gap”\n  * Businesses that deploy AI for the benefit of their customers could almost halve that trust gap\n  * Businesses underestimate the importance of shared values, humanity and consistency when thinking about how to win customer trust\n  * Latest global Fit for The Future report by Vodafone Business and the London School of Economics shows how the right technology and approach can bridge the trust gap between businesses and their customers, to make them _Fit for the Future_\n\n\n\nBusinesses that use AI and Generative AI to deliver faster response times could see a 16% jump in customer trust scores if the technology is deployed with a human touch – meaning for the benefit of customers, and in a way that addresses any ethical, privacy or data security concerns – according to [new global research by Vodafone Business](https://www.vodafone.com/business/the-trust-gap), giving them a competitive advantage.\n\nA study delivered in partnership with the London School of Economics, which surveyed more than 2,300 businesses and over 5,000 customers across 10 markets, identified a divide between how much businesses think they are trusted by customers compared with what their customers actually feel. That “Trust Gap” is on average 11 percentage points, and has a real impact on business performance, representing missed opportunities, disappointed customers and lost revenue.\n\nAmanda Jobbins, Chief Marketing Officer, Vodafone Business said: “Trust makes a material difference to a business’s performance. The trust associated with new technologies like AI, and how they’re used by businesses, is at an inflection point. The difference between eroding trust or winning it comes down to how businesses deploy these technologies.”\n\nThe research found thatbusinesses underestimate the importance of shared values, humanity and consistency when thinking about how to win customer trust. Taking a “human-first” approach to applying new technologies can boost trust scores by up to 16%.\n\nThe report also found that 59% of customers think that AI-savvy businesses are more likely to make accurate predictions and 53% say they would have confidence in AI technologies completing day-to-day tasks more effectively. \n\nMatthew Syed, Journalist and Author, said: “Building trust takes time and effort, but it also helps if you care. Businesses can benefit in both huge and more subtle ways by building trust into everything they do, not least deploying new technologies. Trust isn't just about delivering a good and reliable product or service, but going the extra mile to ensure that customers feel connected to employees, brand and business.”\n\n#### How does the trust gap differ per industry or sector?\n\nThis divide also varies greatly when looking across industries. Typically-B2B businesses like construction and professional services foster a more trustworthy relationship because they have clear contract terms that promise results, which helps explain why their trust gap is so much narrower than other sectors. \n\n#### How do ‘Fit for the Future’ businesses measure up?\n\nVodafone tracks a cohort of businesses described as “Fit for the Future.” These firms are almost three times more likely to align with customers on the importance of shared values, humanity and consistency. On top of being more aligned with these customer priorities, “Fit for the Future” organisations are already using technology to improve response times, manage data safely and deliver information to customers in a faster, more reliable way. Previous reports have shown that Fit for the Future Businesses are more commercially successful and have higher ESG scores. \n\nLearn more: <https://www.vodafone.com/business/the-trust-gap>\n\n#### Notes to editors\n\n**Methodology**\n\nQuantitative research was conducted by B2B International in collaboration with the London School of Economics, commissioned by Vodafone Business. The study surveyed 2359 businesses and 5289 individual customers across 10 markets and 11 key sectors of the economy.\n\nTo create Trust Scores for businesses and industries, the study asked research participants to give organisations a rating on a 1 – 5 scale, according to how much they agreed or disagreed with four statements within each of the three pillars within a definition of Trust. Businesses were asked to give themselves a score on these measures, according to how they thought customers would rank them.\n\nPlease visit the methodology section of the report for more information. \n\n#### About Fit for the Future\n\nIn 2020, Vodafone Business set out to discover which businesses are prepared for the future, what they’re doing differently to other businesses, how they approach different challenges and how they fared during the pandemic. We conducted qualitative and quantitative research across 10 markets globally in 2019 and 2020. We found there were six characteristics that correlated most clearly with businesses – we called these businesses ‘Fit for the Future’ (FFTF).\n\nFFTF businesses are more confident in their ability to use technology, quicker to respond to upcoming trends and faster to market than their competitors, and this includes monitoring their carbon footprint. We continue to track FFTF businesses in our studies to see how they fare to potential issues or scenarios compared to those who may not be as prepared. \n\nIn the 2021 report, we partnered with the London School of Economics to understand whether being Fit for the Future affected company performance. The report revealed a close correlation between being Fit for the Future and commercial performance. Even after controlling for factors such as company size, location and sector, financial performance relative to competitors is greater when firms score higher in terms of their Fit for Future score. Similarly, being Fit for the Future is associated with higher ESG scores.\n\n#### About Vodafone \n\nVodafone is a leading European and African telecoms company. We provide mobile and fixed services to over 330 million customers in 15 countries (excludes Italy which is held as a discontinued operation under Vodafone Group), partner with mobile networks in 45 more and have one of the world’s largest IoT platforms.
