Exscientia ADSs (Nasdaq: EXAI) ceased trading and will be delisted from Nasdaq.\n\n“I believe the combination of the incredible teams and platforms at Exscientia and Recursion position us as the leader of the AI-enabled drug discovery and development space,” said Chris Gibson, Ph.D., Co-Founder and CEO of Recursion. “With more than 10 clinical and preclinical programs in the internal pipeline, more than 10 partnered programs and over $450M in upfront and realized milestone payments received from partners to date out of more than $20B possible, we are advancing a flywheel of discovery and creating value in our pipeline through technology.”\n\n“The combination of our platforms and people make us the company to beat,” said David Hallett, Ph.D., former CSO and Interim CEO of Exscientia and newly appointed Chief Scientific Officer at Recursion. “With our combined strength of real-world proprietary data and the models we’ve created – hypothesizing, testing and learning in a continuous loop – we're redefining the space by shrinking timelines and costs, identifying and optimizing lead candidates faster than traditional methods.”\n\n**The Company is pleased to share updates on the combined entity’s pipeline, partnerships, and platform below:**\n\n**Pipeline**\n\nThe combined pipeline represents more than 10 clinical and preclinical programs. In addition there are approximately 10 advanced discovery programs in the current pipeline.\n\nUpdated guidance is bulleted below as well as a snapshot of our pipeline:\n\n  * REC-617 (CDK7 inhibitor; Advanced Solid Tumors): Initial Phase 1 monotherapy safety and PK/PD data expected at the [AACR Special Conference ](https://www.aacr.org/meeting/aacr-special-conference-in-cancer-research-optimizing-therapeutic-efficacy-and-tolerability-through-cancer-chemistry/program/)on December 9th 2024, and a webinar to follow on December 10th 2024.\n  * REV102 (ENPP1 inhibitor; Hypophosphatasia): Development candidate nomination expected in Q4 2024\n  * REC-4881 (MEK1/2 inhibitor, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis): Phase 1b/2 safety and early efficacy data expected in H1 2025\n  * REC-2282 (pan-HDAC inhibitor; Neurofibromatosis Type 2): PFS6 futility analysis expected by H1 2025\n  * REC-3565 (MALT1 inhibitor, B-Cell Malignancies): Phase 1 first patient dosed (FPD) expected in Q1 2025\n  * REC-4539 (LSD1 inhibitor, Small-Cell Lung Cancer): Phase 1 first patient dosed (FPD) expected in H1 2025\n  * REC-994 (Superoxide scavenger, Cerebral Cavernous Malformation): Further data to be shared at an upcoming medical conference / publication / webinar in H1 2025; regulatory update expected by H2 2025\n  * REC-394 (C. difficile Toxin B selective inhibitor, C. difficile): Phase 2 update expected in Q1 2026\n  * REC-1245 (RBM39 degrader; Solid Tumors and Lymphoma): Phase 1 dose-escalation data update expected in H1 2026 \n  * REC-4209 (undisclosed target; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis): IND-enabling studies are ongoing\n  * REC-4881 in APC/AXIN1 indications have been deprioritized as part of a disciplined strategic prioritization of the portfolio.

Both lead compounds have met the product profile requirements, set by both Exscientia and Sanofi, to enable a transition to the lead optimisation phase within the collaboration. Both programmes have also shown a high level of differentiation in early profiling and have the potential to produce best-in-class assets. \n\n“We are excited to announce the advancement of these programmes. This is testament to our consistent ability to design compounds that solve complex problems,” said David Hallett, Ph.D., interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Scientific Officer of Exscientia. “We look forward to continuing to work with Sanofi to advance these programmes towards development, and ultimately working together to bring potential new treatment options to patients with significant unmet need.” \n\nExscientia will receive $15 million, in aggregate, for achieving these milestones. The payment is expected to be received by Exscientia in the fourth quarter of 2024 and reflected as cash inflows from collaborations and recognised as revenue over the duration of the collaboration. For these two programmes, Exscientia is also eligible to receive additional pre-commercial milestone payments of over $300 million and commercial milestones of over $300 million as well as tiered royalties on product sales ranging from high-single-digits to mid-teens, subject upon the achievement of certain specified research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones. \n\n**About Exscientia** Exscientia is a technology-driven drug design and development company, committed to creating more effective medicines for patients, faster. Exscientia combines precision design with integrated experimentation, aiming to invent and develop the best possible drugs in the most efficient manner. Operating at the interfaces of human ingenuity, artificial intelligence (AI), automation and physical engineering, we pioneered the use of AI in drug discovery as the first company to progress AI-designed small molecules into a clinical setting. We have developed an internal pipeline focused on oncology, while our partnered pipeline extends to many other therapeutic areas. By leading this new approach to drug creation, we believe we can change the underlying economics of drug discovery and rapidly advance the best scientific ideas into medicines for patients. \n\nFor more information visit us on [www.exscientia.com](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.exscientia.com&esheet=54136471&newsitemid=20241016255653&lan=en-US&anchor=www.exscientia.com&index=1&md5=5e42578daeaceec5de1de1dcc0471ca7) or follow us on LinkedIn [@ex-scientia](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fcompany%2Fex-scientia&esheet=54136471&newsitemid=20241016255653&lan=en-US&anchor=%40ex-scientia&index=2&md5=af4baae03f9565f50ea5b72602073a8e) and X [@exscientiaAI](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FexscientiaAI&esheet=54136471&newsitemid=20241016255653&lan=en-US&anchor=%40exscientiaAI&index=3&md5=33b2b6d381c06ae850ae8ab381471b3a). \n\n**Forward-looking Statements** This press release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
