The Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CETX” and will begin trading on a post-split basis when the market opens on November 26, 2024. The new CUSIP number for the Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split will be 15130G881.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement for continued listing on Nasdaq.\n\nAt the Effective Time of the Reverse Stock Split, every 35 shares of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Stock will be combined into one share of Common Stock issued and outstanding, with no change to the par value of $0.001 per share. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split and instead each holder of Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will receive one whole share of Common Stock in lieu of such fractional share.\n\nThe principal effect of the Reverse Split will be that (i) the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding will be reduced to one-thirty-fifth that amount, and (ii) all outstanding options and warrants (other than the Adjustable Warrants) entitling the holders thereof to purchase shares of common stock will enable such holders to purchase, upon exercise of their options or warrants, one-twentieth of the number of shares of common stock which such holders would have been able to purchase upon exercise of their options or warrants, immediately preceding the Reverse Split at an exercise price equal to 35 times the exercise price specified before the Reverse Split, resulting in essentially the same aggregate price being required to be paid therefor upon exercise thereof immediately preceding the Reverse Split. Other awards under our 2020 Equity Compensation Plan would be subject to proportionate adjustments.\n\nClearTrust, LLC is acting as transfer and exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders with shares held in certificated form will receive from ClearTrust, LLC instructions regarding the exchange of their certificates. Stockholders that hold shares in book-entry form or hold their shares in brokerage accounts are not required to take any action and will see the impact of the Reverse Stock Split reflected in their accounts, subject to brokers’ particular processes. Beneficial holders of Common Stock are encouraged to contact their bank, broker, custodian or other nominee with questions regarding procedures for processing the Reverse Stock Split.\n\n**About Cemtrex**\n\nCemtrex Inc.

Once installed, remote positioning allows installers—and even end users—to set the perfect field-of-view from anywhere within seconds. Additionally, its unique modular design combined with its interchangeable mix-and-match components, supports endless customer applications without the need for additional training or tools.\n  * **AI Processing Capabilities:** With industry-leading AI processing capabilities, NEXT brings powerful intelligence right to the camera, enabling security professionals to quickly identify incidents and suspects. NEXT’s advanced color forensics can pinpoint specific clothing and vehicle colors, while smart object classification instantly distinguishes between people, vehicles, and animals. Real-time analytics take it further, detecting potential threats like loitering and intrusions before they escalate.\n  * **Advanced Onboard Technologies & Integrations:** Packed with several intelligent features, NEXT’s compact design includes high-powered microphones with a 50-foot range and 360° commercial-grade speakers for real-time audio warnings and communications. Additionally, the dome contains programmable signal lightbars to communicate situational awareness status to indicate threats, warnings or other operational conditions.\n  * **Modular Sensor System:** A single hub can manage up to four sensors, optimizing installation and reducing the need for multiple network drops or power sources, making it highly efficient. Whether now or down the road save time and hassle by leveraging the unique design of NEXT to future proof your organization.\n\n\n\n“Saving up to 45 minutes of setup time per camera gives our partners a powerful advantage, especially when you need to install hundreds of cameras on a job site,” said Haim Shain, Sr. Vice President of Product Management. “Furthermore, because of the easy setup, built-in intelligence, and remote positioning, they won’t have to return to the site just to adjust the field-of-view, re-tune the camera, clean the lens, etc., which means integrators can spend less time servicing old business and focus more on winning new customers. This efficiency cuts their project costs tremendously, which can help them be more competitive in their bids, ultimately delivering more to their bottom lines.”\n\nSaagar Govil, CEO of Vicon Industries, added, “NEXT embodies our vision of security technology as more than passive recording—it’s an active tool that delivers intelligence. Most security cameras today are outdated, built on disjointed technologies that have been stacked on top of each other for over 50 years. With NEXT, we started from scratch, seeking to redefine what a camera can be. NEXT possesses features that truly address modern organizations’ unique security needs and integration challenges that come with them.”\n\n“That’s why we built NEXT from the ground up with the latest AI technology—30x more powerful than our award-winning Roughneck AI cameras,” Shain added. “Customers who invest in the NEXT solution today will benefit from frequent and regular future enhancements, many of which are already on deck. For example, additional advanced on-board technologies, such AI noise cancellation and the seamless integration with IoT devices, will be available via a simple firmware update in the very near future. Additionally, the modular design of NEXT lends itself to an expanding ecosystem of sensors to further support the growing needs of today’s businesses.”\n\nNEXT integrates seamlessly into Vicon’s existing ecosystem, enhancing intelligent forensic searches within both Valerus, Vicon’s on-premises Video Management System, and Anavio, its cloud-based platform. With Anavio, NEXT also supports face-based People Search, enabling users to track suspicious individuals throughout their facilities with precision and ease. Vicon is currently certifying NEXT with the industry's other top video management systems, allowing customers to leverage the camera’s innovative features without having to rip and replace their existing systems and infrastructure.\n\n\"NEXT represents a strategic shift for Vicon. By integrating with other major video management systems, we’re expanding beyond our own ecosystem to deliver broader value in the security market. Many enterprises are not in the position to switch video management systems, but they can still take advantage of NEXT’s benefits with its seamless integration into their existing platform. The process is already underway, and we expect final certification with the top five video management systems prior to shipping,\" Govil concluded.\n\nThe company is taking orders now, and the NEXT solution will start shipping in Q1 2025.\n\n**Where to See NEXT** In conjunction with the announcement Vicon is kicking off a webinar series to showcase NEXT with an exclusive webinar scheduled for November 14 for existing Vicon customers. The company will be exhibiting at upcoming tradeshows, starting with ISC East at the Jacob Javitz Center in New York City (November 19-21).

Significant demand for AIS products and services drove a 49% increase in revenue to $8.5 million, offset by decreases in Vicon revenue due to the delay of multiple projects and a weaker industrywide demand for security solutions.\n\n“Operating loss for the third quarter was $3.2 million, compared to operating income of $0.1 million a year ago, mainly due to decreased gross profit in our Security segment and increased G&A expenses. The operating loss for the nine-month period was $5.0 million compared to $1.5 million a year ago, despite the higher sales. However, these results include approximately $2 million in one-time expenses related to the May 2024 equity financing, employee related one-time charges and legal expenses. Our goal of achieving a full year operating profit remains and we are working hard to drive revenue and maintain tight cost controls.\n\n“In our Security segment, despite project delays, the team at Vicon continues to push the deployment of new technologies and products with investments into sales and marketing resources that we believe will drive sales over the next several quarters. We also were able to reduce our inventory by over $1 million this fiscal year as we strive to make our operations more efficient. We expect with the launch of the innovative new cloud security platform Anavio, along with new technologies and continued improvements to our core software platform Valerus, there is significant further opportunity to grow revenue and gross margin over the next several quarters.\n\n“Our Industrial services segment delivered another strong quarter on orders from leading companies, building a pipeline of growth that we believe will produce a record year of revenue. We continue to believe with additional orders ahead, AIS has the potential to reach more than 30% annual revenue growth in FY’24, with further room for growth in FY 25.\n\n“During the quarter we took the opportunity to improve our balance sheet with a $10 million upsized underwritten public offering, of which a portion of the proceeds were used to pay off some of our indebtedness. Looking ahead, we are now well positioned for additional growth and to reach our goal to achieve positive operating income in the future. The strengthened balance sheet also provides the ability to explore acquisition opportunities that can enhance our market reach and service capabilities, as we continue to seek long-term value for our shareholders,” concluded Govil.\n\n**Third Quarter FY 2024 Financial Results**\n\nRevenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 was $14.7 million and $14.7 million, respectively. The Security segment revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2024, decreased by 31% to $6.2 million. The Security segment decrease was due to the delay of multiple projects for the Security segment’s products and services and overall worsening economic conditions in the industry. The Industrial Services segment revenues for the third quarter increased by 49% to $8.5 million, mainly due to increased demand for the segment’s services as well as additional business from the Heisey acquisition completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\n\nGross Profit for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was $5.9 million, or 40% of revenues, as compared to gross profit of $6.5 million, or 44% of revenues, for the three months ended June 30, 2023.\n\nTotal operating expenses for three months ended June 30, 2024, were $9.1 million, compared to $6.4 million in the prior year’s quarter.\n\nOperating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.2 million as compared to an operating income of $0.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. The operating loss was primarily due to a decrease in gross profit in the Security segment and overall increased general and administration expenses.\n\nNet loss for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 was $9.1 million, as compared to a net loss of $1.2 million in the prior year’s quarter.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $7.6 million at June 30, 2024, as compared to $6.3 million at September 30, 2023.\n\nInventories decreased to $7.5 million at June 30, 2024, from $8.7 million at September 30, 2023.\n\n**Third Quarter FY 2024 Results Conference Call**\n\nCemtrex Chief Executive Officer Saagar Govil and Chief Financial Officer Paul Wyckoff will host the conference call, followed by a question-and-answer period.\n\nTo access the call, please use the following information:\n\nDate: | Wednesday, August 14, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime: | 5:00 p.m. Eastern time, 2:00 p.m. Pacific time  \nToll-free dial-in number: | 1-800-717-1738  \nInternational dial-in number: | 1-646-307-1865  \nConference ID: | 1123331  \n  \nPlease call the conference telephone number 5-10 minutes prior to the start time.
