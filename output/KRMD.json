We see strength in our recurring chronic subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIg) patient base, and we continue to further drive collaborations in our novel therapies business as more drugs move to subcutaneous administration. We are excited by the progress we continue to make in executing against our long-term strategies and growth objectives which has enabled us to raise guidance for our 2024 revenue, gross margin, and year-end cash-balance.” \n\n**2024 Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n**Three Months Ended September 30,** |  **Change from Prior Year** |  **% of Net Revenues**  \n---|---|---  \n**2024** |  **2023** |  **$** |  **%** |  **2024** |  **2023**  \n**Net Revenues**  \nDomestic Core  |  $  |  6,447,469  |  $  |  5,773,863  |  $  |  673,606  |  11.7%  |  78.8%  |  82.4%   \nInternational Core  |  1,121,196  |  1,066,567  |  54,629  |  5.1%  |  13.7%  |  15.2%   \nTotal Core  |  7,568,665  |  6,840,430  |  728,235  |  10.6%  |  92.5%  |  97.7%   \nNovel Therapies  |  611,312  |  162,768  |  448,544  |  275.6%  |  7.5%  |  2.3%   \n**Total** |  $  |  8,179,977  |  $  |  7,003,198  |  $  |  1,176,778  |  16.8%  |  100%  |  100%   \n  \nTotal net revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $8.2 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 16.8% over the prior year period. Domestic core revenues were $6.4 million, an increase of 11.7% over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable and pump volumes driven by new patients starts and market share gains. International core revenues were $1.1 million, an increase of 5.1% over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable volumes driven largely by increased Ig supply, increased penetration within certain approved indications, and geographic expansion. Partially offsetting the growth were lower orders from a distribution partner that expedited $0.3 million orders in the second quarter of 2024 related to the BSI regulatory review which has since been successfully appealed. Novel Therapies revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.6 million, an increase of 275.6% over the prior year period, primarily driven by clinical trial orders and progress on NRE milestones completed for multiple collaboration agreements. \n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.2 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 19%, over the prior year period. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 63.4%, an increase of 140 basis points, compared to 62.0% in the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a favorable sales mix of clinical trial orders, improved NRE mix of more profitable services, and increased average selling prices when compared to the prior year period. \n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.9 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 12.3%, over the prior year period primarily driven by compensation related to new hires, bonus accruals, and severance for the elimination of the CTO role. \n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.6 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, for the prior year period, primarily driven by an increase in operating expenses of $0.8 million, and a prior year tax benefit of $0.2 million offset by an increase in gross profit of $0.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.4) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($0.9) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, for the for the prior year period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS is provided at the end of this press release. \n\nCash and cash equivalents were $8.8 million as of September 30, 2024, reflecting cash usage of $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\n  * Raising full year 2024 net revenue guidance to $32.75 - $33.25, representing growth of 15% - 17%; increased from previously issued guidance of $32.0 - $32.5 million, or 12% - 14% \n\n\n  * Raising full year 2024 gross margin guidance to 62% - 63%; increased from previously issued guidance of 61% - 62% \n\n\n  * Raising guidance of 2024 year-end cash balance to greater than $8.8 million increased from previously issued guidance of greater than $8.0 million year-end cash balance \n\n\n  * Reiterating cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2024 and cash flow positive for full year 2025 \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\nThe Company will host a live conference call and webcast to discuss these results and provide a corporate update on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM ET. \n\nTo participate in the call, please dial (877) 407-0784 (domestic) or (201) 689-8560 (international).

These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. Reconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP measures are included at the end of this press release. \n\n**About KORU Medical Systems**\n\nKORU Medical develops, manufactures, and commercializes innovative and patient-centric large volume subcutaneous infusion solutions that improve quality of life for patients around the world.

These non-GAAP measures are not\nbased on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of\nfinancial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on KORU Medical's\nreported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures are\nmeant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP measures are included at the end of\nthis presentation.\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*\n*Non-cash items\n15"

Domestic core revenues were $6.4 million, an increase of 11.7% over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable and pump volumes driven by new patients starts and market share gains. International core revenues were $1.1 million, an increase of 5.1% over the prior year period, primarily due to higher consumable volumes driven largely by increased Ig supply, increased penetration within certain approved indications, and geographic expansion. Partially offsetting the growth were lower orders from a distribution partner that expedited $0.3 million orders in the second quarter of 2024 related to the BSI regulatory review which has since been successfully appealed. Novel Therapies revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.6 million, an increase of 275.6% over the prior year period, primarily driven by clinical trial orders and progress on NRE milestones completed for multiple collaboration agreements. \n\nGross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.2 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 19%, over the prior year period. Gross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was 63.4%, an increase of 140 basis points, compared to 62.0% in the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by a favorable sales mix of clinical trial orders, improved NRE mix of more profitable services, and increased average selling prices when compared to the prior year period. \n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $6.9 million, an increase of $0.8 million, or 12.3%, over the prior year period primarily driven by compensation related to new hires, bonus accruals, and severance for the elimination of the CTO role. \n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.6 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.4 million, or ($0.03) per diluted share, for the prior year period, primarily driven by an increase in operating expenses of $0.8 million, and a prior year tax benefit of $0.2 million offset by an increase in gross profit of $0.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was ($0.4) million, or ($0.01) per diluted share, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($0.9) million, or ($0.02) per diluted share, for the for the prior year period. A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS is provided at the end of this press release. \n\nCash and cash equivalents were $8.8 million as of September 30, 2024, reflecting cash usage of $1.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**2024 Guidance**\n\n  * Raising full year 2024 net revenue guidance to $32.75 - $33.25, representing growth of 15% - 17%; increased from previously issued guidance of $32.0 - $32.5 million, or 12% - 14% \n\n\n  * Raising full year 2024 gross margin guidance to 62% - 63%; increased from previously issued guidance of 61% - 62% \n\n\n  * Raising guidance of 2024 year-end cash balance to greater than $8.8 million increased from previously issued guidance of greater than $8.0 million year-end cash balance \n\n\n  * Reiterating cash flow breakeven in the fourth quarter of 2024 and cash flow positive for full year 2025 \n\n\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details**\n\nThe Company will host a live conference call and webcast to discuss these results and provide a corporate update on Wednesday, November 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM ET. \n\nTo participate in the call, please dial (877) 407-0784 (domestic) or (201) 689-8560 (international).

These non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on KORU Medical’s reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company’s financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, GAAP financial results. Reconciliations of the Company’s non-GAAP measures are included at the end of this press release. \n\n**About KORU Medical Systems**\n\nKORU Medical develops, manufactures, and commercializes innovative and patient-centric large volume subcutaneous infusion solutions that improve quality of life for patients around the world.

We have excluded the effect of recording a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the third quarter ended 2024 in the amount of $0.3 million. It was determined that no valuation allowance was necessary in the third quarter ended 2023. \n\n_Reorganization Charges._ We have excluded the effect of reorganization charges in calculating our non-GAAP measures. In 2024 we incurred severance expenses related to the reorganization of the leadership team, which we would not have otherwise incurred in periods presented as part of continuing operations. \n\n_Stock-based Compensation Expense_. We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense in calculating our non-GAAP measures. We record non-cash compensation expenses related to grants of equity-based awards for executives, employees, consultants, and directors. Depending upon the size, timing and the terms of the grants, the non-cash compensation expense may vary significantly but is expected to recur in future periods. \n\nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241113344251/en/>\n\n**Investor Contact:** Louisa Smith investor@korumedical.com\n\nSource: KORU Medical Systems, Inc.\n\nReleased November 13, 2024\n\n  * [Email Alerts](/investors/news-events/email-alerts)\n  * [Tear Sheet](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_93ffccf90d639efa46baa3a41c619a49/korumedical/files/Tear+Sheet.pdf \"Tear Sheet\")\n  * [Contacts](/investors/company-information/contacts)\n  * [RSS News Feed](https://www.korumedical.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/rss)\n\n\n"
