The most comprehensive of the\nCompany’s online platforms is The Value Line Research Center, which allows subscribers to access most of the Company’s research and publications at a packaged\nprice via the Internet.\nInvestment analysis software (The Value Line Investment Analyzer and The Value Line ETFs Service) includes data sorting and filtering tools. In addition, for\ninstitutional and professional subscribers, VLP offers current and historical financial databases (DataFile, Estimates & Projections, and Mutual Funds) via the Internet.\nThe print and digital services include, but are not limited to the following:\nThe Value Line Investment Survey\nThe Value Line Investment Survey is an investment periodical research service providing both timely articles on economic, financial and investment matters and\nanalysis and ranks for equity securities. Two of the evaluations for covered equity securities are \"Timeliness™\" and \"Safety™”. “Timeliness” Ranks relate to the\nprobable relative price performance of one stock over the next six to twelve months, as compared to the rest of the stock coverage universe. Ranks are updated each\nweek and range from Rank 1 for the expected best performing stocks to Rank 5 for the expected poorest performers. \"Safety\" Ranks are a measure of risk and are based\non the issuer's relative Financial Strength and its stock's Price Stability. \"Safety\" ranges from Rank 1 for the least risky stocks to Rank 5 for the riskiest. VLP employs\nanalysts and statisticians who prepare articles of interest for each periodical and who evaluate stock performance and provide future earnings estimates and quarterly\nwritten evaluations with more frequent updates when relevant. The Value Line Investment Survey is comprised of three parts: The \"Summary & Index\" provides\nupdated Timeliness and Safety Ranks, selected financial data, and \"screens\" of key financial measures; the \"Ratings & Reports\" section contains the updated reports\non stocks each week; and the “Selection & Opinion” section provides economic commentary and data, articles, and model portfolios managed by analysts covering a\nrange of investment approaches.\nThe Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap\nThe Value Line Investment Survey - Small and Mid-Cap is an investment research tool introduced in 1995 that provides short descriptions of and extensive\ndata for small and medium-capitalization stocks, many listed on The NASDAQ Exchange, beyond the equity securities of generally larger-capitalization companies\ncovered in The Value Line Investment Survey. Like The Value Line Investment Survey, the Small and Mid-Cap has its own \"Summary & Index\" providing updated\nperformance ranks and other data, as well as \"screens\" of key financial measures and two model portfolios. The print portion of the service is issued monthly. The 400\nstocks of the Small & Mid-Cap universe selected for inclusion in the print component of the service are those of most importance to subscribers and are mailed to\nsubscribers in updated monthly groups. Each stock is covered 4 times per year – once per quarterly cycle. The Digital component of the service remains unchanged --\nupdated weekly with the complete stock coverage universe available for review. The Performance Rank is designed to predict relative price performance over the next six\nto twelve months.\nThe Value Line Fund Advisor Plus\nThe Value Line Mutual Fund Ranking System was introduced in 1993. It is the system utilized in the Fund Advisor Plus, featuring load, no-load, and low-load\nopen-end mutual funds.

A full statistical review, including latest performance, ranks, and sector weightings, is updated each month on approximately 800 leading\nload, no-load and low-load funds. Included with this product is online access to Value Line’s database of approximately 20,000 mutual funds, including screening tools\nand full-page printable reports on each fund.

The main feature of the M&A Service\nconsists of a detailed, multipage highlight on a stock that Value Line thinks is a good acquisition candidate. New recommendations are then added to the M&A Model\nPortfolio.\nThe Value Line Climate Change Investing Service\nThis monthly service was introduced in April 2021.

The business of EAM is managed by five individual trustees and a\nDelaware resident trustee (collectively, the “Trustees”) and by its officers subject to the direction of the Trustees.\nCollectively, the holders of the voting profits interests in EAM are entitled to receive 50% of the residual profits of the business, subject to temporary\nadjustments in certain circumstances. Value Line holds a non-voting profits interest representing 50% of residual profits, subject to temporary adjustments in certain\ncircumstances, and has no power to vote for the election, removal or replacement of the trustees of EAM. Value Line also has a non-voting revenues interest in EAM\npursuant to which it is entitled to receive a portion of the non-distribution revenues of the business ranging from 41% at non-distribution fee revenue levels of $9 million\nor less to 55% at such revenue levels of $35 million or more. In the event the business is sold or liquidated, the first $56.1 million of net proceeds plus any additional\ncapital contributions (Value Line or any holder of a voting profits interest, at its discretion, may make future contributions to its capital account in EAM), which\ncontributions would increase its capital account but not its percentage interest in operating profits, will be distributed in accordance with capital accounts; 20% of the\nnext $56.1 million will be distributed to the holders of the voting profits interests and 80% to the holder of the non-voting profits interests (currently, Value Line); and the\nexcess will be distributed 45% to the holders of the voting profits interests and 55% to the holder of the non-voting profits interest (Value Line). EAM has elected to be\ntaxed as a pass-through entity similar to a partnership.\nAlso, pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, Value Line (1) granted each Fund use of the name “Value Line” so long as EAM remains the Fund’s adviser\nand on the condition that the Fund does not alter its investment objectives or fundamental policies from those in effect on the date of the investment advisory\nagreement with EAM, provided also that the Funds do not use leverage for investment purposes or engage in short selling or other complex or unusual investment\nstrategies that create a risk profile similar to that of so-called hedge funds, (2) agreed to provide EAM its proprietary Ranking System information without charge or\nexpense on as favorable basis as to Value Line’s best institutional customers and (3) agreed to capitalize the business with $7 million of cash and cash equivalents at\ninception.\nEAM is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and has no fixed term. However, in the event that control of the Company’s majority shareholder changes, or in\nthe event that the majority shareholder no longer beneficially owns 5% or more of the voting securities of the Company, then the Company has the right, but not the\nobligation, to buy the voting profits interests in EAM at a fair market value to be determined by an independent valuation firm in accordance with the terms of the EAM\nDeclaration of Trust.\n11\nValue Line also has certain consent rights with respect to extraordinary events involving EAM, such as a proposed sale of all or a significant part of EAM,\nmaterial acquisitions, entering into businesses other than asset management and fund distribution, paying compensation in excess of the mandated limit of 22.5%-30%\nof non-distribution fee revenues (depending on the level of such revenues), declaring voluntary bankruptcy, making material changes in tax or accounting policies or\nmaking substantial borrowings, and entering into related party transactions. These rights were established to protect Value Line’s non-voting revenues and non-voting\nprofits interests in EAM.\nEAM acts as the Adviser to the Value Line Funds. EULAV Securities acts as the Distributor for the Value Line Funds. State Street Bank, an unaffiliated entity, is\nthe custodian of the assets of the Value Line Funds and provides them with fund accounting and administrative services. Shareholder services for the Value Line Funds\nare provided by SS&C.\nThe Company maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by EAM and will continue to receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting\nrevenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below. Total assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2024, were $4.17\nbillion, which is $1.08 billion, or 35.0%, above total assets of $3.09 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2023.\nTotal net assets of the Value Line Funds at April 30, 2024, were:\n($ in thousands)\nValue Line Asset Allocation Fund $ 909,517\nValue Line Capital Appreciation Fund 427,755\nValue Line Mid Cap Focused Fund 1,462,284\nValue Line Small Cap Opportunities Fund 587,214\nValue Line Select Growth Fund 417,967\nValue Line Larger Companies Focused Fund 332,473\nValue Line Core Bond Fund 35,837\nTotal EAM managed net assets $ 4,173,047\nInvestment management fees and distribution service fees (“12b-1 fees”) vary among the Value Line Funds and may be subject to certain limitations. Certain\ninvestment strategies among the equity funds include, but are not limited to, reliance on the Value Line Timeliness ™ Ranking System (the “Ranking System”) and/or the\nValue Line Performance Ranking System in selecting securities for purchase or sale. Each Ranking System seeks to compare the estimated probable market performance\nof each stock during the next six to twelve months to that of all stocks under review in each system and ranks stocks on a scale of 1 (highest) to 5 (lowest). All the\nstocks followed by the Ranking System are listed on U.S. stock exchanges or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter markets. Prospectuses and annual reports for each of\nthe Value Line open end mutual funds are available on the Funds’ website www.vlfunds.com. Each mutual fund may use \"Value Line\" in its name only to the extent\npermitted by the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust.\n12\nD.

Principal Business Segments\nThe information with respect to revenues from external customers and profit and loss of the Company's identifiable principal business segments is incorporated\nherein by reference to Note 18 of the Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nI. Competition\nThe investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very\ncompetitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater\nfinancial resources than the Company and EAM. The Internet continues to increase the amount of competition in the form of free and paid online investment research.\nWith regard to the investment management business conducted by EAM, the prevalence of broker supermarkets or platforms permitting easy transfer of assets among\nmutual funds, mutual fund families, and other investment vehicles tends to increase the speed with which shareholders can leave or enter the Value Line Funds based,\namong other things, on short-term fluctuations in performance.\n13\nJ.

RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks referred to elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks, among others, sometimes may have affected, and in the future could affect,\nthe Company’s businesses, financial condition or results of operations and/or the investment management business conducted by EAM and consequently, the amount\nof revenue we receive from EAM. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not discussed or not presently known to us or that we\ncurrently deem insignificant, may also impact our businesses.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are dependent on the efforts of its executives and professional staff.\nThe Company’s future success relies upon its ability to retain and recruit qualified professionals and executives. The Company’s executive officers do not have\nemployment agreements with the Company and the Company does not maintain “key man” insurance policies on any of its executive officers. The loss of the services of\nkey personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nA decrease in the revenue generated by EAM’s investment management business could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and financial condition.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its cash flow from its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM. A decrease in the revenue\ngenerated by EAM’s investment management business, whether resulting from performance, competitive, regulatory or other reasons, would reduce the amount of cash\nflow received by the Company from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and financial condition.\nEAM’s assets under management, which impact EAM’s revenue, and consequently the amount of the cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, are subject\nto fluctuations based on market conditions and individual fund performance.\nFinancial market declines and/or adverse changes in interest rates would generally negatively impact the level of EAM’s assets under management and\nconsequently its revenue and net income. Major sources of investment management revenue for EAM (i.e., investment management and service and distribution fees)\nare calculated as percentages of assets under management. A decline in securities prices or in the sale of investment products or an increase in fund redemptions would\nreduce fee income. A prolonged recession or other economic or political events could also adversely impact EAM’s revenue if it led to decreased demand for products, a\nhigher redemption rate, or a decline in securities prices. Good performance of managed assets relative to both competing products and benchmark indices generally\nassists in both retention and growth of assets, and may result in additional revenues. Conversely, poor performance of managed assets relative to competing products\nor benchmark indices tends to result in decreased sales and increased redemptions with corresponding decreases in revenues to EAM. Poor performance could\ntherefore reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives from EAM, which reduction could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition.\nEAM derives nearly all of its investment management fees from the Value Line Funds.\nEAM is dependent upon management contracts and service and distribution contracts with the Value Line Funds under which these fees are paid. As required\nby the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), the Trustees/Directors of the Funds, all of whom are independent of the Company and EAM (except for the\nCEO of EAM), have the right to terminate such contracts. If any of these contracts are terminated, not renewed, or amended to reduce fees, EAM’s financial results, and\nconsequently, the amount of cash flow received by the Company from EAM, and the Company’s financial condition, may be adversely affected.\nA decrease in the revenue generated by a significant customer could adversely affect the Company’s cash flow and financial condition.\nThe Company derives a significant portion of its cash flow and publishing revenues from a single significant customer.\n15\nIf the Company does not maintain its subscriber base, its operating results could suffer.\nA substantial portion of the Company’s revenue is generated from print and digital subscriptions, which are paid in advance by subscribers. Unearned\nrevenues are accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company within current and long-term liabilities. The backlog of orders is primarily generated\nthrough renewals and new subscription marketing efforts as the Company deems appropriate. Future results will depend on the renewal of existing subscribers and\nobtaining new subscriptions for the investment periodicals and related publications. The availability of competitive information on the Internet at low or no cost has had\nand may continue to have a negative impact on the demand for our products.\nThe Company believes that the negative trend in retail print subscription revenue experienced in recent years is likely to continue.\nDuring recent years, the Company has experienced a negative trend in retail print subscription revenue. While circulation of some print publications has\nincreased, others have experienced a decline in circulation or in average yearly price realized. It is expected that print revenues will continue to decline long-term, while\nthe Company emphasizes digital offerings. The Company has established the goal of maintaining competitive digital products and marketing them through traditional\nand digital channels to retail and institutional customers. However, the Company is not able to predict whether revenues from digital retail publications will grow more\nthan print revenues decline.\nLoss of copyright clients or decline in their customers, or assets managed by third party sponsors could reduce the Company’s revenues.\nCopyright agreements are based on market interest in the respective proprietary information. The Company believes this part of the business is dependent\nupon the desire of third parties to use the Value Line trademarks and proprietary research for their products, competition and on fluctuations in segments of the equity\nmarkets. If the fees from proprietary information decline, the Company’s operating results could suffer.\nFailure to protect its intellectual property rights and proprietary information could harm the Company’s ability to compete effectively and could negatively affect\noperating results.\nThe Company’s trademarks are important assets to the Company. Although its trademarks are registered in the United States and in certain foreign countries,\nthe Company may not always be successful in asserting global trademark protection. In the event that other parties infringe on its intellectual property rights and it is\nnot successful in defending its intellectual property rights, the result may be a dilution in the value of the Company’s brands in the marketplace. If the value of the\nCompany’s brands becomes diluted, such developments could adversely affect the value that its customers associate with its brands, and thereby negatively impact its\nsales. Any infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of Company resources to protect these rights through litigation or\notherwise. In addition, third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able successfully to resolve such claims. The Company\nis utilizing all of its trademarks and properly maintaining registrations for them.\nThe Company and EAM face significant competition in their respective businesses.\nBoth the investment information and publishing business conducted by the Company and the investment management business conducted by EAM are very\ncompetitive. There are many competing firms and a wide variety of product offerings. Some of the firms in these industries are substantially larger and have greater\nfinancial resources than the Company and EAM. With regard to the investment information and publishing business, barriers to entry have been reduced by the minimal\ncost structure of the Internet and other technologies. With regard to the investment management business, the absence of significant barriers to entry by new\ninvestment management firms in the mutual fund industry increases competitive pressure. Competition in the investment management business is based on various\nfactors, including business reputation, investment performance, quality of service, marketing, distribution services offered, the range of products offered and fees\ncharged. Access to mutual fund distribution channels has also become increasingly competitive.\n16\nGovernment regulations, any changes to government regulations, and regulatory proceedings and litigation may adversely impact the business.\nChanges in legal, regulatory, accounting, tax and compliance requirements could have an effect on EAM’s operations and results, including but not limited to\nincreased expenses and restraints on marketing certain funds and other investment products. EAM is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of\n1940 (the “Advisers Act”). The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary, record keeping, operational and\ndisclosure obligations. ES is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,\nalso known as “FINRA”. Each Value Line Fund is a registered investment company under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act requires numerous compliance measures, which\nmust be observed, and involves regulation by the SEC. Each fund and its shareholders may face adverse tax consequences if the Value Line Funds are unable to\nmaintain qualification as registered investment companies under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Those laws and regulations generally grant broad\nadministrative powers to regulatory agencies and bodies such as the SEC and FINRA. If these agencies and bodies believe that EAM, ES or the Value Line Funds have\nfailed to comply with their laws and regulations, these agencies and bodies have the power to impose sanctions. EAM, ES and the Value Line Funds, like other\ncompanies, can also face lawsuits by private parties. Regulatory proceedings and lawsuits are subject to uncertainties, and the outcomes are difficult to predict.\nChanges in laws, regulations or governmental policies, and the costs associated with compliance, could adversely affect the business and operations of the EAM, ES\nand the Value Line Funds. An adverse resolution of any regulatory proceeding or lawsuit against the EAM or ES could result in substantial costs or reputational harm to\nthem or to the Value Line Funds and have an adverse effect on their respective business and operations. An adverse effect on the business and operations of EAM, ES\nand/or the Value Line Funds could reduce the amount of cash flow that the Company receives in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in\nEAM and, consequently, could adversely affect the Company’s cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks could adversely affect the Company and EAM.\nA terrorist attack, including biological or chemical weapons attacks, and the response to such terrorist attacks, could have a significant impact on the New York\nCity area, the local economy, the United States economy, the global economy, and U.S. and/or global financial markets, and could also have a material adverse effect on\nthe Company’s business and on the investment management business conducted by EAM.\nFuture pandemic outbreaks could disrupt the Company’s operations.\nA substantial recurrence of infections of the COVID-19 virus or its variants could disrupt Company printing and distribution operations, or supplies of materials\nand services needed for the print publishing business. While the Company believes that its office, editorial, and administrative operations, and those of its suppliers of\ndata and other services, are adequately backed-up for fully remote operations if needed, likewise a future pandemic outbreak could interfere with the continuity of\nprinting and distribution operations, as well as endangering personnel of the Company and its supply chain partners.\nOur controlling stockholder exercises voting control over the Company and has the ability to elect or remove from office all of our directors.\nAs of April 30, 2024, AB&Co., Inc. beneficially owned 91.63% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s voting stock. AB&Co. is therefore able to exercise\nvoting control with respect to all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election or removal from office of all of our directors.\nWe are not subject to most of the listing standards that normally apply to companies whose shares are quoted on NASDAQ.\nOur shares of common stock are quoted on the NASDAQ Capital Market (“NASDAQ”). Under the NASDAQ listing standards, we are deemed to be a\n“controlled company” by virtue of the fact that AB&Co. has voting power with respect to more than 50% of our outstanding shares of voting stock. A controlled\ncompany is not required to have a majority of its board of directors comprised of independent directors. Director nominees are not required to be selected or\nrecommended for the board’s selection by a majority of independent directors or a nomination committee comprised solely of independent directors, nor do the\nNASDAQ listing standards require a controlled company to certify the adoption of a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the\nnominations process. A controlled company is also exempt from NASDAQ’s requirements regarding the determination of officer compensation by a majority of the\nindependent directors or a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. Although we currently comply with certain of the NASDAQ listing\nstandards that do not apply to controlled companies, our compliance is voluntary, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards\nin the future.\n17\nWe are subject to cyber risks and may incur costs in connection with our efforts to enhance and ensure security from cyber attacks.\nSubstantial aspects of our business depend on the secure operation of our computer systems and e-commerce websites. Security breaches could expose us to\na risk of loss or misuse of sensitive information, including our own proprietary information and that of our customers and employees. While we devote substantial\nresources to maintaining adequate levels of cyber security, our resources and technical sophistication may not be adequate to prevent all of the rapidly evolving types\nof cyber attacks. Anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur increasing costs for technology, personnel, insurance and services to enhance security or to\nrespond to occurrences. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any possible future breaches of our\nsystems.\nChanges to existing accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may affect how we conduct our business and affect our reported results of\noperations.\nNew accounting pronouncements or tax rules and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practice have occurred and may occur in\nthe future. A change in accounting pronouncements or interpretations or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even\naffect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. Changes to existing rules and pronouncements, future changes, if any, or the questioning\nof current practices or interpretations may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business.\nItem 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone.\nItem 2. PROPERTIES.\nThe Company leases 24,726 square feet of office space at 551 Fifth Avenue in New York, NY. In addition to the New York office space, the Company leased a\nwarehouse facility with 24,110 square feet in New Jersey until April 30, 2024. Value Line Distribution Center, Inc. (“VLDC”) distributed Value Line’s print publications\nprior to April 30, 2024. Operations were outsourced to a third party in the United States prior to April 30, 2024.\nOn November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement\nbetween Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square\nfeet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on\nNovember 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for\neach subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-\nthrough of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the\namount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on September 30, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the\nCompany’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the\nPremises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first six\nmonths of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied\nagainst the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.\nBase rent under the Lease was $237,218 per annum. The Company has outsourced to a U.S. facility the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse,\nsubsequent to the expiration of the lease on April 30, 2024.\n18\nItem 3.

The MD&A should be read in conjunction with Item 1, “Business”, and Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of Form 10-K, and in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in Item 8 of this report.\nThe MD&A includes the following subsections:\n● Executive Summary of the Business\n● Results of Operations\n● Liquidity and Capital Resources\n● Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n● Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nExecutive Summary of the Business\nThe Company's core business is producing investment periodicals and their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line\ntrademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary information, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed\ninvestment products and for other purposes. Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line®, the Value Line logo®, The Value Line Investment\nSurvey®, Smart Research, Smarter Investing™ and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research®. The name \"Value Line\" as used to describe the Company, its\nproducts, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust (“EAM”) was established to provide the investment\nmanagement services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line®\nMutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues\nand non-voting profits interests.\nThe Company’s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals.\nIndividuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal\nlibraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company’s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and\nhistorical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.\nPayments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as\nunearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription.\nAccordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned\nrevenue within current and long-term liabilities.\nThe Company allocates resources and assesses financial performance on a consolidated basis. It does so because significant costs are shared in common by\nall products, and as a result, it does not have discrete financial information available for separate business components to assess performance and make resource\nallocation decisions for more than one segment. Therefore, the investment periodicals and related publications (such as digital equivalents), along with supplying the\nembedded Proprietary information and intellectual property rights, are treated as one segment, Publishing.\n21\nAsset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses\nPursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has\nno voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business.\nThe business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20% of the voting interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees.\nThe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution\nrevenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited\ncircumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders received the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s profits payable each\nfiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.\nBusiness Environment\nThe U.S. economy has shown some signs of slowing, as the Federal Reserve likely nears the end of its most restrictive monetary policy course in four decades.\nThe nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by an estimated 1.3% (annualized) in the first quarter. This marked a notable slowdown from the respective\nadvances of 4.9% and 3.4% recorded during the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2023. Gains in consumer spending, residential and nonresidential investment, and\ngovernment spending were partly offset by a decrease in private inventory investment and an increase in imports.\nAs of mid-2024, the Federal Reserve was not yet ready to reverse monetary policy course. In June, it kept the federal funds rate at a “sufficiently restrictive”\n5.25% to 5.50% for the seventh-consecutive Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. At that time, the central bank’s projection for interest-rate cuts in 2024\nwas lowered from three to one. In addition, four Federal Reserve voting members predicted no interest-rate cuts this year, citing the need to see more progress on the\ninflation front.\nMeantime, the case for a “soft” economic landing remained in play, as the second half of calendar 2024 commenced. True, there were pockets of weakness in\nthe economy, including contracting activity in the manufacturing sector and the slowing pace of both residential and nonresidential construction. However, the\nconsumer is still spending, though not at the rate seen coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, buoyed by a still-resilient labor market. Through the first five months of\nthis year, the nation added an estimated 1.2 million jobs, and the unemployment rate was at 4.0%, a level suggestive of full employment. This, combined with an easing in\nthe pace of consumer and producer (wholesale) price growth in May, suggests that the Fed is making progress on its dual mandate to promote stable pricing and\nmaximum employment.\nIn conclusion, the Federal Reserve’s restrictive monetary policy course has made a notable dent in inflation, which peaked in June of 2022, without disrupting\nthe labor market. While some more work needs to be done to bring the pace of price growth closer to the Fed’s target rate of 2%, we think a cut to the benchmark short-\nterm interest rate is quite plausible if inflation continues on its overall downward trajectory during the second half of 2024. In all, the current business environment has\nheld up well, with profit growth expectations for S&P 500 companies in the second half of the year being ratcheted up. For 2024, Wall Street is now predicting low\ndouble-digit corporate earnings growth, a level that may be needed justify the S&P 500’s elevated price-to-earnings multiple.\n22\nResults of Operations for Fiscal Years 2024, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table illustrates the Company’s key components of revenues and expenses.\nFiscal Years Ended April 30, Change\n($ in thousands, except earnings per share) 2024 2023 2022 '24 vs. '23 '23 vs. '22\nIncome from operations $ 9,141 $ 11,470 $ 10,800 -20.3% 6.2%\nGain on forgiveness of SBA loan - - 2,331 n/a n/a\nNon-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests from EAM\nTrust 13,282 11,131 18,041 19.3% -38.3%\nIncome from operations plus non-voting revenues and non-voting\nprofits interests from EAM Trust and gain on SBA loan forgiveness 22,423 22,601 31,172 -0.8% -27.5%\nOperating expenses 28,346 28,225 29,725 0.4% -5.0%\nInvestment gains 2,764 1,174 (534) 135.4% n/a\nIncome before income taxes $ 25,187 $ 23,775 $ 30,638 5.9% -22.4%\nNet income $ 19,016 $ 18,069 $ 23,822 5.2% -24.1%\nEarnings per share $ 2.02 $ 1.91 $ 2.50 5.8% -23.6%\nDuring the three months ended April 30, 2024, the Company’s net income of $4,784,000, or $0.51 per share, was 18.6% above net income of $4,033,000, or $0.43\nper share, for the three months ended April 30, 2023.

As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, particularly\nin volatile markets, total product line circulation at April 30, 2024, was 3.2% below total product line circulation at April 30, 2023. However, Institutional Sales department\ntotal sales orders reached a record level last fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and this higher profit margin distribution to financial advisors and professional investors\nsignificantly offsets the long-term trend of declining individual investor circulation.\nCirculation also reflected management’s decision to reduce marketing efforts temporarily while the challenging stock market environment persisted.

During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, print publication revenues of\n$9,286,000, decreased 6.8%, below print publication revenues of $9,963,000 during April of 2023 because we deferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among\nprospective individual customers in a challenging market environment.

The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to April 30, 2023, is\nprimarily a result of an increase in the state and local tax rate from 3.25% to 3.72%.The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023\nas compared to April 30, 2022, is primarily a result of the non-taxable revenue derived from forgiveness of the PPP loan by the SBA (see note 19) in fiscal 2022 partially\noffset by an increase in the state and local income taxes from 3.12% to 3.25% as a result of changes in state and local income tax allocation factors. The Company's\nannualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the\nratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each\nlocality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $48,770,000 as of April 30, 2024 and $42,788,000 as of April 30, 2023.\nThese amounts include short-term unearned revenue of $15,764,000 and $16,771,000 reflected in total current liabilities at April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively.\nCash and short-term securities were $68,345,000 and $62,064,000 as of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively.\n32\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents include $4,136,000 and $7,240,000 at April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively, invested primarily in commercial\nbanks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities.\nCash from operating activities\nThe Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $17,932,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, compared to cash inflows from\noperations of $18,178,000 and $24,646,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in cash flows from fiscal 2023 to fiscal\n2024 was a result of decreased interest income, the timing of receipts from accounts receivable and slowdown in the decline of unearned revenue. The decrease in cash\nflows from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to lower pre-tax income and a decrease in cash receipts from EAM and the timing of receipts from copyright\nprograms.\nCash from investing activities\nThe Company’s cash outflows from investing activities of $10,048,000 during the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, compared to cash outflows from\ninvesting activities of $26,116,000 and cash outflows of $3,389,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022, respectively. Cash outflows for the\ntwelve months ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, were primarily due to the Company’s decision to invest in additional fixed income securities, primarily United\nStates government obligations, in fiscal 2024 and 2023.\nCash from financing activities\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, the Company’s cash outflows from financing activities were $11,084,000 and compared to cash outflows from\nfinancing activities of $14,175,000 and $10,889,000 for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash outflows for financing activities included\n$523,000, $4,704,000 and $2,484,000 for the repurchase of 12,057 shares, 75,303 shares and 53,327 shares of the Company’s common stock under the July 2021, March\n2022, May 2022 & October 2022 board approved common stock repurchase programs, during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During fiscal 2020, the\nCompany applied for and received an SBA loan under the Paycheck Protection Program in the amount of $2,331,000. The obligation to repay the SBA loan under the\nPaycheck Protection Program was forgiven during fiscal 2022. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.28 per share during fiscal 2024 aggregated $10,561,000.\nQuarterly regular dividend payments of $0.25 per share during fiscal 2023 aggregated $9,471,000.

The Company\nexpects financing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future.\nManagement believes that the Company’s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the proceeds from the SBA loan and the\nfuture cash flows from operations and from the Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and\nforecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond next year. Management does not anticipate making any additional borrowings during the next twelve\nmonths. As of April 30, 2024, retained earnings and liquid assets were $104,249,000 and $68,345,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, retained earnings and liquid\nassets were $95,979,000 and $62,064,000, respectively.\nSeasonality\nOur publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally\nseasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals.\n33\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” as\npart of its initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The standard eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation,\nthe methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies\nand simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes including interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax laws. The Company adopted this\nguidance effective May 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which\nrequires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied\non a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We\nare evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for\nadditional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax\nrate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects,\ntax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature\nand jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual\njurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States\n(U.S. “GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the\nCompany evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes\nthe following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements:\n● Valuation of EAM\nInvestment in EAM Trust\nThe Company accounts for its investment in EAM using the equity method of accounting. The value of its investment in EAM is the fair value of the\ncontributed capital at inception, plus the Company’s share of non-voting revenues and non-voting profits from EAM, less distributions received from EAM. The\nCompany evaluates its investment in EAM on a regular basis for other-than-temporary impairment, which requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment.\nShould the fair value of the investment fall below its carrying value, the Company will determine whether the investment is other-than-temporarily impaired,\nwhich includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery. If the investment is considered to be other-than-temporarily\nimpaired, the Company will write down the investment to its fair value. Since the inception of EAM, the Company has not recognized any other-than-temporary\nimpairment in the investment.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are a party to lease contracts which will result in cash payments to lessors in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next four fiscal years (in thousands): $1,429 in 2025; $1,461 in 2026; $1,493 in 2027 and $882 in 2028\ntotaling $5,265.\n34\nItem 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nThe Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company’s market risks\nare primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company’s investment\nactivities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that\nlosses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company’s management invests primarily in short-term obligations\nmaturing within one year.\nThe fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing\ninterest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be\naffected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions.\nFixed income securities consist of certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state and local governments within the United States. As of April 30,\n2024 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $47,931,000 and $47,611,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2023 the\naggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $39,455,000 and $39,928,000, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It\nis assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest\nrates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments\ndue to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.\nFixed Income Securities Estimated Fair Value after\nHypothetical Change in Interest Rates\n(in thousands)\n(bp = basis points)\n1 year 1 year 1 year 1 year\nFair 50 bp 50 bp 100 bp 100 bp\nValue increase decrease increase decrease\nAs of April 30, 2024\nInvestments in securities with fixed maturities $ 47,611 $ 46,554 $ 46,935 $ 46,363 $ 47,126\nAs of April 30, 2023\nInvestments in securities with fixed maturities $ 39,928 $ 39,202 $ 39,512 $ 39,048 $ 39,667\nManagement regularly monitors the maturity structure of the Company’s investments in debt securities in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated\nwith changes in interest rates.\n35\nEquity Price Risk\nThe carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to\nfluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the\nmarket price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and\ngeneral market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.\nThe Company’s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for\ndividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes and ETFs that hold preferred shares primarily of financial institutions. In order to\nmaintain liquidity in these securities, the Company’s policy has been to invest in and hold in its portfolio, no more than 5% of the approximate average daily trading\nvolume in any one issue.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF\n(SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY) and other\nExchange Traded Funds was a combined total $11,663,000 and $10,169,000, respectively, and the fair value was $16,344,000 and $14,546,000, respectively.\nHypothetical\nEstimated Fair Percentage\nEquity Securities Value after Increase\nHypothetical Hypothetical (Decrease) in\n($ in thousands) Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Shareholders’ Equity\nAs of April 30, 2024 Equity Securities and ETFs $ 16,344 30% increase $ 21,247 4.27%\nheld for dividend yield\n30% decrease $ 11,441 -4.27%\nHypothetical\nEstimated Fair Percentage\nEquity Securities Value after Increase\nHypothetical Hypothetical (Decrease) in\n($ in thousands) Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Shareholders’ Equity\nAs of April 30, 2023 Equity Securities and ETFs $ 14,546 30% increase $ 18,910 4.12%\nheld for dividend yield\n30% decrease $ 10,182 -4.12%\n36\nItem 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nItem 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\nThe Company's Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's \"disclosure controls and\nprocedures\" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of April 30, 2024, as required by paragraph (b) of\nExchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer are engaged in a comprehensive effort to review, evaluate\nand improve the Company's controls; however, management does not expect that the Company's disclosure controls or its internal controls over financial reporting can\nprevent all possible errors and fraud.\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports\nfiled with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is\naccumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer, as appropriate, to allow timely\ndecisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and, the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer have\nconcluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nThis Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Under applicable SEC rules, no such attestation report by the Company's registered public accounting firm is required.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nIn the course of the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President & Treasurer considered certain internal\ncontrol areas in which the Company has made and is continuing to make changes to improve and enhance controls. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive\nOfficer and Vice President & Treasurer of the Company concluded that there were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in\nconnection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.\n(b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)\nunder the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal\nfinancial officers, and effected by the board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n38\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\npolicies and procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Vice President & Treasurer, acting as Principal\nFinancial Officer, the Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of April 30, 2024. In making this assessment, management\nused the criteria described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that the Company did maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 30,\n2024.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal control systems over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially\naffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. The Company administrative and finance personnel have been\noperating on a near-fully remote basis during the entirety of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 as a result of pandemic restrictions and precautions. The internal control\nsystems have remained intact.\nItem 9B. OTHER INFORMATION.\nNone.\n39\nPart III\nItem 10.

Fiore\nAlfred Fiore\nDirector\n/s/ Mary Bernstein\nMary Bernstein\nDirector\nDated: July 26, 2024\n47\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and\nBoard of Directors of Value Line, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Value Line, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related\nconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April\n30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nfinancial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended\nApril 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements\nbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to\nbe independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to\nperform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial\nreporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no\nsuch opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n48\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required\nto be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to the accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved\nour especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entity\nAs described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the equity method of accounting to report its investment in its unconsolidated entity.\nAs of April 30, 2024, the carrying value of the investment was $60,134,000. On an annual basis, management performs an impairment assessment to ensure that the\ncarrying value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity is properly reflected.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to such assessment is a critical audit matter are that there were significant\njudgements made by management in estimating the fair value of the investment and the fact that management utilized a specialist to assist in its determination of fair\nvalue. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity, and audit effort in evaluating management’s estimation of the fair value of the investment in its\nunconsolidated entity, including management’s assessment of the unconsolidated entity’s financial condition and results of operations.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements. These procedures included, among others, reviewing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity,\nevaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the model, and evaluating the significant assumptions\nused by management.\n/s/ Horowitz & Ullmann, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.\nNew York, NY\nJuly 25, 2024\n49\nPart II\nItem 8.\nValue Line, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share amounts)\nApril 30, April 30,\n2024 2023\nAssets\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents (including short term investments of $4,136 and $7,240, respectively) $ 4,390 $ 7,590\nEquity securities 16,344 14,546\nAvailable-for-sale Fixed Income securities 47,611 39,928\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $31 and $36, respectively 1,310 2,124\nPrepaid and refundable income taxes 209 425\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,160 1,463\nTotal current assets 71,024 66,076\nLong term assets:\nInvestment in EAM Trust 60,134 58,775\nRestricted money market investments 305 305\nProperty and equipment, net 4,440 5,788\nCapitalized software and other intangible assets, net 132 132\nTotal long term assets 65,011 65,000\nTotal assets $ 136,035 $ 131,076\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 1,430 $ 1,263\nAccrued salaries 1,020 961\nDividends payable 2,827 2,642\nAccrued taxes on income 7 307\nOperating lease obligation-short term 1,206 1,344\nUnearned revenue 15,764 16,771\nTotal current liabilities 22,254 23,288\nLong term liabilities:\nUnearned revenue 6,517 6,202\nOperating lease obligation-long term 3,578 4,784\nDeferred income taxes 12,893 13,129\nTotal long term liabilities 22,988 24,115\nTotal liabilities 45,242 47,403\nShareholders' Equity:\nCommon stock, $0.10 par value; authorized 30,000,000 shares; issued 10,000,000 shares 1,000 1,000\nAdditional paid-in capital 991 991\nRetained earnings 104,249 95,979\nTreasury stock, at cost (577,517 shares and 565,460 shares, respectively) (15,194) (14,671)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax (253) 374\nTotal shareholders' equity 90,793 83,673\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 136,035 $ 131,076\nSee independent auditor's report and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n50\nPart II\nItem 8.\nValue Line, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(in thousands, except share & per share amounts)\nFor the Fiscal Years Ended\nApril 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nRevenues:\nInvestment periodicals and related publications $ 25,420 $ 26,232 $ 27,145\nCopyright fees 12,067 13,463 13,380\nTotal publishing revenues 37,487 39,695 40,525\nExpenses:\nAdvertising and promotion 2,955 3,049 3,223\nSalaries and employee benefits 14,851 15,203 17,323\nProduction and distribution 5,455 5,210 5,003\nOffice and administration 5,085 4,763 4,176\nTotal expenses 28,346 28,225 29,725\nIncome from operations 9,141 11,470 10,800\nGain on forgiveness of SBA loan -

(\"Value Line\" or \"VLI\", and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is incorporated in the State of New York. The name \"Value Line\" as used to\ndescribe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals\nand their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary\ninformation, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. The Company maintains\na significant investment in Eulav Asset Management LLC (\"EAM\") from which it receives a non-voting revenues interest and a non-voting profits interest. Pursuant\nto the EAM Declaration of Trust dated as of December 23, 2010 (the \"EAM Trust Agreement\"), VLI granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name for all existing\nValue Line Funds and agreed to supply, without charge or expense, the Value Line Proprietary Ranking System information to EAM for use in managing the Value Line\nFunds. EAM was established to provide investment management services to the Value Line Mutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\" or the \"Funds\").\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe Company follows the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Topic 810 “Consolidation” to determine if it should consolidate its\ninvestment in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). A VIE is a legal entity in which either (i) equity investors do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to enable the\nentity to finance its activities independently or (ii) the equity holders at risk lack the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns or the right to make\ndecisions about the entity’s activities that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance. A holder of a variable interest in a VIE is required to consolidate\nthe entity if it is determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary. The determination of a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is based on a qualitative assessment to identify the variable interest holder, if any, that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. The accounting guidance requires the Company to perform an ongoing assessment of whether the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE and the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE (see Note 5).\nIn accordance with FASB's Topic 810, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest have been\nconsolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company holds a significant non-voting revenues\ninterest (excluding distribution revenues) and a significant non-voting profits interest in EULAV Asset Management, a Delaware statutory trust (“EAM” or “EAM\nTrust”). The Company relied on the guidance in FASB's ASC Topics 323 and 810 in its determination not to consolidate its investment in EAM and to account for such\ninvestment under the equity method of accounting. The Company reports the amount it earns for its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests as a separate\nline item below operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nRevenue Recognition:\nDepending upon the product, subscription fulfillment for Value Line periodicals and related publications is available in print or digitally, via internet access. The length\nof a subscription varies by product and offer received by the subscriber. Generally, subscriptions are offered as annual subscriptions with the majority of subscriptions\npaid in advance. Subscription revenues, net of discounts, are recognized ratably on a straight line basis when the product is served to the client over the life of the\nsubscription. Accordingly, the amount of subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of the balance sheets are shown as unearned revenue\nwithin current and long-term liabilities.\nCopyright fees are derived from providing certain Value Line trademarks and the Value Line Proprietary Ranks to third parties under written agreements for use in\nselecting securities for third party marketed products, including unit investment trusts, annuities and exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\"). The Company earns asset-based\ncopyright fees upon delivery to the customer as specified in the individual agreements. Revenue is recognized monthly and received either quarterly or in advance over\nthe term of the agreement and, because it is asset-based, will fluctuate as the market value of the underlying portfolio increases or decreases in value.\nEAM earns investment management fees from the Value Line Funds. The management fees and average daily net assets for the Value Line Funds are calculated by State\nStreet Bank, which serves as the fund accountant, fund administrator, and custodian of the Value Line Funds.\nThe Value Line Funds are open-end management companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"). Shareholder transactions for the\nValue Line Funds are processed each business day by the third party transfer agent of the Funds. Shares can be redeemed without advance notice upon request of the\nshareowners each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open.\n55\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities:\nThe Company accounts for its investment in its unconsolidated entity, EAM, using the equity method of accounting in accordance with FASB’s ASC 323. The equity\nmethod is an appropriate means of recognizing increases or decreases measured by GAAP in the economic resources underlying the investments. Under the equity\nmethod, an investor recognizes its share of the earnings or losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements\nrather than in the period in which an investee declares a dividend or distribution. An investor adjusts the carrying amount of an investment for its share of the earnings\nor losses recognized by the investee.\nThe Company’s “interests” in EAM, the investment adviser to and the sole member of the distributor of the Value Line Funds, consist of a \"non-voting revenues\ninterest\" and a \"non-voting profits interest\" in EAM as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement. The non-voting revenues interest entitles the Company to receive a\nrange of 41% to 55%, based on the amount of EAM’s adjusted gross revenues, excluding EULAV Securities' distribution revenues (“Revenues Interest”). The non-\nvoting profits interest entitles the Company to receive 50% of EAM's profits, subject to certain limited adjustments as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement (“Profits\nInterest”). The Revenues Interest and at least 90% of the Profits Interest are to be distributed each quarter to all interest holders of EAM, including Value Line. The\nCompany's Revenues Interest in EAM excludes participation in the service and distribution fees of EAM's subsidiary EULAV Securities. The Company reflects its non-\nvoting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM as non-operating income under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company does not have\ncontrol over the operating and financial policies of EAM, pursuant to the EAM Trust Agreement, the Company has a contractual right to receive its share of EAM's\nrevenues and profits.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nIn 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes” as part of\nits initiative to reduce complexity in the accounting standards. The standard eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the\nmethodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies and\nsimplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes including interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax laws. The Company adopted this guidance\neffective May 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires\ndisclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied on a\nretrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are\nevaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional\ndisclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate\nreconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax\ncredits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and\njurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual\njurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Securities:\nThe Company's securities classified as cash equivalents, equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities consist of shares of money market funds that\ninvest primarily in short-term U.S. Government securities, investments in equities including ETFs and fixed income securities invested primarily in short-term U.S.\nTreasury bills, and to a smaller extent bank certificates of deposit that are valued in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the\nFASB's ASC 820. The securities classified as equity securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and\nlosses are recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income per FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (\"ASU 2016-01\"). The securities\nclassified as available-for-sale fixed income securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses, net\nof applicable taxes, are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Investment gains and losses on sales of the equity securities are the difference\nbetween proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Investment gains and losses on sales\nof the available-for-sale fixed income securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the cost of the securities. Investment gains and losses on sales of all\nsecurities are recorded in earnings as of the trade date and are determined on the identified cost method.\nThe Company classifies its equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities as current assets to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the fact that\nit has liquid assets available-for-sale should the need arise.\nMarket valuations of securities listed on a securities exchange and ETF shares are based on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month. The market\nvalue of the Company's fixed maturity U.S. Government debt securities is determined utilizing publicly quoted market prices. Cash equivalents consist of investments in\nmoney market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Government securities valued in accordance with rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.\n56\nThe Fair Value Measurements Topic of FASB's ASC defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in a timely transaction to\nan independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. The Fair Value Measurements Topic established a three-tier hierarchy to maximize\nthe use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs\nrefer broadly to the information that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Examples of risks include those\ninherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs are classified as\nobservable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on\nmarket data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the\nfactors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical investments\nLevel 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)\nLevel 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)\nThe following summarizes the levels of fair value measurements of the Company’s investments:\nAs of April 30, 2024\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 4,136 $ - $ - $ 4,136\nEquity securities 16,344 - - 16,344\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities 47,361 250 - 47,611\n$ 67,841 $ 250 $ - $ 68,091\nAs of April 30, 2023\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 7,240 $ - $ - $ 7,240\nEquity securities 14,546 - - 14,546\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities 39,178 750 - 39,928\n$ 60,964 $ 750 $ - $ 61,714\nThe Company had no other financial instruments such as futures, forwards and swap contracts. For the periods ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, there were no\nLevel 3 investments. The Company does not have any liabilities subject to fair value measurement.\nAdvertising expenses:\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company computes its income tax provision in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based\non the differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular assets and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect for the years in which the differences\nare expected to reverse. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17, Income taxes (Topic 740) and classifies all deferred taxes as long-term liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC establishes for all entities, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax\nreturns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. As of April 30, 2024, management has reviewed\nthe tax positions for the years still subject to tax audit under the statute of limitations, evaluated the implications, and determined that there is no material impact to the\nCompany's financial statements.\nEarnings per share:\nEarnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. Any shares\nthat are reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they are outstanding. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive common\nshares from outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.\n57\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nFor purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash held at banks and short-term liquid investments with an original maturity\nof less than three months to be cash and cash equivalents. As of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, cash equivalents included $4,136,000 and $7,240,000, respectively, for\namounts invested in money market mutual funds that invest in short-term U.S. government securities.\nNote 2 - Supplementary Cash Flow Information:\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows that sum to the\ntotal of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,390 $ 7,590 $ 29,703\nRestricted cash 305 305 305\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows $ 4,695 $ 7,895 $ 30,008\nIncome Tax Payments:\nThe Company made income tax payments as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nState and local income tax payments $ 1,090 $ 923 $ 894\nFederal income tax payments $ 5,448 $ 4,425 $ 5,400\nSee Note 3 - Related Party Transactions for tax amounts associated with Arnold Bernhard and Co., Inc. (“AB&Co.” or the \"Parent\").\nNote 3 - Related Party Transactions:\nInvestment Management (overview):\nThe Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the\nCompany does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and\nreceives non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below.\nTotal assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2024, were $4.17 billion, which is $1.08 billion, or 35.0%, above total assets of $3.09\nbillion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at April 30, 2023.\nThe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive quarterly distributions in a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues\n(excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in\ncertain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s\nprofits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line’s percent share of EAM’s revenues is calculated each fiscal quarter.\nThe non-voting revenues and 90% of the Company's non-voting profits interests due from EAM to the Company are payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of\nthe EAM Trust Agreement. The distributable amounts earned through the balance sheet date, which is included in the Investment in EAM Trust on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets, and not yet paid, were $3,865,000 and $2,601,000 at April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively.\nEAM Trust - VLI's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests:\nThe Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from 41% to\n55% of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business. EAM currently has no separately managed account clients.\nThe Company recorded income from its non-voting revenues interest and its non-voting profits interests in EAM as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nNon-voting revenues interest in EAM $ 11,900 $ 10,397 $ 15,899\nNon-voting profits interest in EAM 1,382 734 2,142\n$ 13,282 $ 11,131 $ 18,041\n58\nTransactions with Parent:\nDuring the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the Company was reimbursed $364,000 and $369,000, respectively for payments it made on behalf of and\nfor services it provided to AB&Co. There were no receivables due from the Parent at April 30, 2024 or April 30, 2023.\nThe Company is a party to a tax-sharing arrangement with the Parent which allocates the tax liabilities of the two Companies between them. For the years ended April 30,\n2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company made payments to the Parent for federal income tax amounting to $5,448,000, $4,425,000, and $5,400,000, respectively.\nFrom time to time, the Parent has purchased additional shares of common stock of the Company in the market when and as the Parent has determined it to be\nappropriate.

Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings\nperformance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the\ninvestee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of the industry in which the investee operates, or (d) factors that raise significant concerns\nabout the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern such as negative cash flows, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital and\nregulatory requirements. EAM did not record any impairment losses for its assets during the fiscal years 2024 or 2023.\n60\nThe components of EAM’s investment management operations, provided to the Company by EAM, were as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nInvestment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds, net of waivers\nshown below $ 24,383 $ 19,824 $ 29,598\n12b-1 fees and other fees, net of waivers shown below $ 6,584 $ 5,964 $ 9,310\nOther income/(losses) $ 433 $ 142 $ (20)\nInvestment management fee waivers and reimbursements $ 288 $ 164 $ 547\n12b-1 fee waivers $ 94 $ 105 $ 644\nValue Line’s non-voting revenues interest $ 11,900 $ 10,397 $ 15,899\nEAM's net income (1) $ 2,764 $ 1,468 $ 4,284\n(1) Represents EAM's net income, after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the\nCompany in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nEAM's total assets $ 63,076 $ 61,389\nEAM's total liabilities (1) (5,881) (4,357)\nEAM's total equity $ 57,195 $ 57,032\n(1) At April 30, 2024 and 2023, EAM's total liabilities included a payable to VLI for its accrued non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests of $3,865,000 and\n$2,601,000, respectively.\nNote 5 - Variable Interest Entity:\nThe Company holds a non-voting revenues interest and a 50% non-voting profits interest in EAM, the adviser to the Value Line asset management and mutual fund\ndistribution businesses. EAM is considered to be a VIE in relation to the Company. The Company makes its determination for consolidation of EAM as a VIE based on\na qualitative assessment of the purpose and design of EAM, the terms and characteristics of the variable interests in EAM, and the risks EAM is designed to originate\nand pass through to holders of variable interests. Other than EAM, the Company does not have an interest in any other VIEs.\nThe Company has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest in EAM because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EAM that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance. Value Line does not hold any voting stock of EAM and it does not have any involvement in the day-to-day activities or\noperations of EAM. Although the EAM Trust Agreement provides Value Line with certain consent rights and contains certain restrictive covenants related to the\nactivities of EAM, these are considered to be protective rights and therefore Value Line does not maintain control over EAM.\nIn addition, although EAM is expected to be profitable, there is a risk that it could operate at a loss. While all of the profit interest shareholders in EAM are subject to\nvariability based on EAM’s operations risk, Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest in EAM is a preferred interest in the revenues of EAM, rather than a profits\ninterest in EAM, and Value Line accordingly believes it is subject to proportionately less risk than other holders of the profits interests.\nThe Company has not provided any explicit or implicit financial or other support to EAM other than what was contractually agreed to in the EAM Trust Agreement.\nValue Line has no obligation to fund EAM in the future and, as a result, has no exposure to loss beyond its initial investment and any undistributed revenues and profits\ninterests retained in EAM. The following table presents the total assets of EAM, the maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with EAM, as well as the value of\nthe assets and liabilities the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Balance Sheets for its interest in EAM.\nValue Line\nInvestment in Maximum\n($ in thousands) VIE Assets EAM Trust (1) Liabilities Exposure to Loss\nAs of April 30, 2024 $ 63,076 $ 60,134 $ - $ 60,134\nAs of April 30, 2023 $ 61,389 $ 58,775 $ - $ 58,775\n(1) Reported within Long-Term Assets on Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n61\nNote 6 - Property and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or in\nthe case of leasehold improvements, over the remaining terms of the leases. For income tax purposes, depreciation of furniture and equipment is computed using\naccelerated methods and buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over prescribed extended tax lives. Property and equipment, net, on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets was comprised of the following:\nAs of April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nBuilding and leasehold improvements $ 652 $ 1,013\nOperating lease - right-of-use asset 4,090 5,300\nFurniture and equipment 2,274 4,079\n7,016 10,392\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (2,576) (4,604)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 4,440 $ 5,788\nNote 7 - Federal, State and Local Income Taxes:\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC, the Company's provision for income taxes includes the following:\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2022\nCurrent tax expense:\nFederal $ 4,847 $ 4,702 $ 5,625\nState and local 1,232 984 1,280\nCurrent tax expense 6,079 5,686 6,905\nDeferred tax expense (benefit):\nFederal 86 23 239\nState and local 6 (3) (328)\nDeferred tax expense (benefit): 92 20 (89)\nIncome tax provision $ 6,171 $ 5,706 $ 6,816\nOn December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), was enacted. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal income tax rate (\"Federal\nTax Rate\") from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company computes Federal income tax expense using the Federal Tax Rate of 21% in fiscal year\n2019 and each year thereafter.\nThe overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, April 30, 2023 and April 30, 2022 were\n24.50%, 24.00% and 22.25%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 as compared to April 30, 2023, is\nprimarily a result of an increase in the state and local tax rate from 3.25% to 3.72%.The increase in the effective tax rate during for the twelve months ended April 30, 2023\nas compared to April 30, 2022, is primarily a result of the non-taxable revenue derived from forgiveness of the PPP loan by the SBA (see note 19) in fiscal 2022 partially\noffset by an increase in the state and local income taxes from 3.12% to 3.25% as a result of changes in state and local income tax allocation factors. The Company's\nannualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the\nratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each\nlocality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.\n62\nDeferred income taxes, a liability, are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities.\nThe tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability are as follows:\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nFederal tax liability (benefit):\nDeferred gain on deconsolidation of EAM $ 10,669 $ 10,669\nDeferred non-cash post-employment compensation (372) (372)\nDepreciation and amortization 73 59\nUnrealized gain on securities held for sale 916 919\nRight of Use Asset (128) (174)\nDeferred charges (138) (136)\nOther (424) (333)\nTotal federal tax liability 10,596 10,632\nState and local tax liabilities (benefits):\nDeferred gain on deconsolidation of EAM 2,073 2,062\nDeferred non-cash post-employment compensation (72) (72)\nDepreciation and amortization 13 125\nUnrealized gain on securities held for sale 178 178\nOther 105 204\nTotal state and local tax liabilities 2,297 2,497\nDeferred tax liability, long-term $ 12,893 $ 13,129\nThe tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability is primarily a result of the federal, state and local taxes related to the\n$50,805,000 gain from deconsolidation of the Company's asset management and mutual fund distribution subsidiaries, partially offset by the long-term tax benefit related\nto the non-cash post-employment compensation of $1,770,000 granted to VLI's former employee.\nThe Company uses the effective income tax rate determined to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and reflects the tax effect of any tax law changes and\ncertain other discrete events in the period in which they occur.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pre-tax income as a result of\nthe following:\nFiscal Years Ended April 30,\n2024 2023 2022\nU.S. statutory federal tax rate 21.00% 21.00% 21.00%\nIncrease (decrease) in tax rate from:\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 3.72% 3.25% 3.12%\nNontaxable SBA loan forgiveness - - (1.60%)\nEffect of dividends received deductions (0.23%) (0.26%) (0.29%)\nOther, net 0.01% 0.01% 0.02%\nEffective income tax rate 24.50% 24.00% 22.25%\nThe Company believes that, as of April 30, 2024, there were no material uncertain tax positions that would require disclosure under GAAP.\nThe Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the Parent. The Company has a tax sharing agreement which requires it to make tax payments\nto the Parent equal to the Company's liability/(benefit) as if it filed a separate return. Beginning with the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, the Company files combined\nincome tax returns with the Parent on a unitary basis in certain states as a result of changes in state tax regulations.\nThe Company’s federal income tax returns (included in the Parent’s consolidated returns) and state and city tax returns for fiscal years ended 2020 through 2022, are\nsubject to examination by the tax authorities, generally for three years after they are filed with the tax authorities.\nNote 8 - Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan:\nSubstantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are members of the Value Line, Inc. Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the \"Plan\"). In general, this is a\nqualified, contributory plan which provides for a discretionary annual Company contribution which is determined by a formula based on the salaries of eligible\nemployees and the amount of consolidated net operating income as defined in the Plan. For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the estimated profit\nsharing plan contribution, which is included as an expense in salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was $411,000, $410,000 and\n$557,000, respectively.\n63\nNote 9 - Lease Commitments:\nOn November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value\nLine, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated (“ABM” or the “Sublandlord”) commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM\n24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016\nand ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25%\nscheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor\nand pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit\nin the amount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became\nthe Company’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to\nthe Premises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first\nsix months of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied\nagainst the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC leased\n24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”) beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on April\n30, 2024 (“Lease”). Base rent under the Lease was $237,218 per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which has been fully\nrefunded. VLDC distributed Value Line’s print publications. The Company has outsourced to a U.S. facility the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognizes in the statements\nof financial position a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to make lease\npayments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognizes interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-use asset in\nthe statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. The firm adopted this ASU in May 2019 under a\nmodified retrospective approach.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the Effective Date as permitted by the amendments in ASU 2018-11, which\nprovides an alternative modified retrospective transition method. As a result, the Company was not required to adjust its comparative period financial information for\neffects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e. May 1, 2019). The Company has elected to employ the\ntransitionary relief offered by the FASB and, therefore, has not reassessed (1) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, (2) lease classification for existing or\nexpired leases or (3) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized.\nThe Company leases office space in New York, NY. The Company has evaluated that lease and determined that it is an operating lease under the definitions of the\nguidance of ASU 2016-02.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the net present value of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at\nor before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is\nsubsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the net present value of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid\n(accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset in the amount of $9,575,000, which represents the lease liability of $10,340,000 adjusted for previously\nrecorded unamortized lease incentives in the amount of $765,000. The right-of-use asset will be amortized over the remaining lease term in the amount equal to the\ndifference between the calculated straight-line expense of the total lease payments less the monthly interest calculated on the remaining lease liability. As of April 30,\n2024, the Company had a long-term lease asset of $4,090,000 recorded in property and equipment in its consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company recognizes lease expense, calculated as the remaining cost of the lease allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense are\npresented as part of continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income. For the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, the Company recognized $1,499,000 in\nlease expense.\nFor the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, the Company paid $1,634,000 in rent relating to the leases. As a payment arising from an operating lease, the $1,634,000 will\nbe classified within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n64\nThe Company’s lease does not provide an implicit interest rate, and therefore the Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, as of the commencement\ndate, to determine the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The IBR is defined under ASC 842 as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to\nborrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The following table reconciles the\nundiscounted future minimum lease payments to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of April 30, 2024:\nFiscal years ended April 30, (in thousands)\n2025 $ 1,429\n2026 1,461\n2027 1,493\n2028 882\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 5,265\nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments & the present value of future lease payments 481\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 4,784\nFor the fiscal years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, rental expenses were $1,499,000 each year.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for our operating leases:\nAs of April 30, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 3.58\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.25%\nNote 10 - Disclosure of Credit Risk of Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk:\nOther than EAM and the Value Line Funds as explained in Note 3 - Related Party Transactions, a single customer accounted for a significant portion of the Company's\nsales in fiscal 2024, 2023 or 2022, and its accounts receivable as of April 30, 2024 or 2023. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 32.2%, 33.9%\nand 33.0%, respectively, of total publishing revenues were derived from a single customer as explained in Note 16 - Concentration.\nNote 11 - Comprehensive Income:\nThe FASB's ASC Comprehensive Income topic requires the reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from operations. Comprehensive income is a\nmore inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that otherwise would not be recognized in the calculation of net\nincome.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and April 30, 2023 the Company held fixed income securities consisting of securities issued by federal, state, and local governments within the\nUnited States that are classified as securities available-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in valuation of fixed income securities, net of deferred\nincome taxes, has been recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe components of comprehensive income that are included in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the twelve months ending April 30,\n2024 are as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended April 30, 2024\nTax (Expense) /\n($ in thousands) Amount Before Tax Benefit Amount Net of Tax\nChange in unrealized gains on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ (793) $ 166 $ (627)\n$ (793) $ 166 $ (627)\nThe components of comprehensive income that are included in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the twelve months ending April 30,\n2023 are as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended April 30, 2023\nTax (Expense) /\n($ in thousands) Amount Before Tax Benefit Amount Net of Tax\nChange in unrealized gains on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ 503 $ (105) $ 398\n$ 503 $ (105) $ 398\nThe components of comprehensive income that are included in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the twelve months ending April 30,\n2022 are as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended April 30, 2022\nTax (Expense) /\n($ in thousands) Amount Before Tax Benefit Amount Net of Tax\nChange in unrealized gains on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ (34) $ 7 $ (27)\n$ (34) $ 7 $ (27)\n65\nNote 12 - Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use:\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Position 98-1 (SOP 98-1), \"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use\".\nSOP 98-1 requires companies to capitalize as long-lived assets many of the costs associated with developing or purchasing software for internal use and amortize those\ncosts over the software's estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner. Such costs, when incurred, are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life\nof the asset, normally 3 to 5 years.\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, the Company capitalized $62,000 related to the third party programmers' costs. During the twelve months ended April 30,\n2023, the Company capitalized $110,000 related to the third party programmers' costs. The Company did not incur and did not capitalize expenditures related to third\nparty programmers' costs during the twelve months ended April 30, 2022. Total amortization expenses for the years ended April 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $62,000,\n$49,000 and $73,000, respectively.\nNote 13 - Treasury Stock and Repurchase Program:\nOn October 21, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock up\nto an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in negotiated transactions\noff the market, in block purchases or otherwise. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion and has no set\nexpiration date. There is a remainder of $1,211,000 before the authorized limit is reached.\nTreasury stock, at cost, consists of the following:\nAverage Cost Aggregate Purchase Price\n($ in thousands except for cost per share) Shares Cost Assigned per Share Remaining under the Program\nBalance as of April 30, 2019 336,439 $ 4,743 $ 14.10 $ 1,438\nPurchases effected in open market 46,840 $ 1,214 $ 25.91 $ -\nBalance as of April 30, 2020 383,279 $ 5,957 $ 15.54 $ 2,000\nPurchases effected in open market (1) 53,551 $ 1,526 $ 28.50 $ -\nBalance as of April 30, 2021 436,830 $ 7,483 $ 17.13 $ 474\nPurchases effected in open market (2) 53,327 $ 2,484 $ 46.58 $ -\nBalance as of April 30, 2022 490,157 $ 9,967 $ 20.33 $ 1,241\nPurchases effected in open market (3) 75,303 $ 4,704 $ 62.47 $ -\nBalance as of April 30, 2023 565,460 14,671 $ 25.95 $ 1,266\nPurchases effected in open market (3) 12,057 $ 523 $ 43.38 $ -\nBalance as of April 30, 2024 577,517 15,194 $ 26.31 $ 1,211\n(1) Were acquired during the $2 million repurchase program authorized in April 2020.\n(2) Were acquired during the $2 million repurchase program authorized in July 2021 and the $2 million repurchase program authorized in March 2022.\n(3) Were acquired during the $3 million repurchase program authorized in May 2022 and the $3 million repurchase program authorized in October 2022.\nNote 14 - Copyright Fees:\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, copyright fees of $12,067,000 were 10.4% below fiscal 2023. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2023, copyright\nfees of $13,463,000 were 0.6% above fiscal 2022. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2022, copyright fees of $13,380,000 were 4.8% above fiscal 2021. As of April\n30, 2024, total third party sponsored assets were $9.64 billion, as compared to $12.39 billion in assets at April 30, 2023.\nNote 15 - Restricted Cash and Deposits:\nRestricted Money Market Investment in the noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at April 30, 2024, includes $305,000, which represents\ncash invested in a bank money market fund securing a letter of credit (\"LOC\") in the amount of $305,000 issued to the sublandlord as a security deposit for the\nCompany's New York City leased corporate office facility. According to the sublease agreement the LOC and restricted cash were reduced from $469,000 to $305,000 in\nthe third quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nNote 16 - Concentration:\nDuring the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, 32.2% of total publishing revenues of $37,487,000 were derived from a single customer. During the twelve months ended\nApril 30, 2023, 33.9% of total publishing revenues of $39,695,000 were derived from a single customer. During the twelve months ended April 30, 2022, 33.0% of total\npublishing revenues of $40,525,000 were derived from a single customer.\n66\nNote 17 - Concentration of Credit Risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. At April 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $1,419,000 and $1,569,000, respectively, in excess of\nthe FDIC insured limit. Management has concluded the excess does not represent a material risk, based on the creditworthiness of the counter parties.\nThe Company maintains a deposit account of $305,000 at Flagstar Bank as security for a letter of credit in a similar amount (See Note 15). Signature Bank, previous\ndepository where the $305,000 restricted cash was held, was closed on March 12, 2023 by its state chartering authority and merged with Flagstar Bank. In a joint\nstatement of the U.S. Treasury department, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, these federal entities confirmed that all depositors of\nthis institution were made whole.\nNote 18 - Business Segments:\nThe Company allocates resources and assesses financial performance on a consolidated basis. It does so because significant costs are shared in common by all\nproducts, and as a result, it does not have discrete financial information available for separate business components to assess performance and make resource allocation\ndecisions for more than one segment. Therefore, the investment periodicals and related publications (such as digital equivalents), along with supplying the embedded\nProprietary information and intellectual property rights, are treated as one segment, Publishing.\nAll required segment financial information can be found directly in the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the\nsame as those described in Note 1.\nValue Line’s customers are almost exclusively located within the United States. It receives approximately 2% of its revenues from external customers located outside of\nthe United States.\nAs described in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company deconsolidated its investment management business in December\n2010 and therefore no longer reports the investment management operation as a separate business unit. Although VLI continues to receive significant cash flows from\nthese operations through its non-controlling investment in EAM, it no longer considers this to be a reportable business segment because it does not satisfy one of the\nrequired characteristics of an operating segment pursuant to ASC 280-10-50-1. Specifically, VLI’s Chief Executive Officer does not regularly review EAM’s operating\nresults to make decisions about resources to be allocated to EAM.\nNote 19 - Paycheck Protection Program Loan:\nShortly after declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic and \"lockdowns\" of numerous non-essential businesses, the Company in April of 2020 executed a note and received\na loan (the \"PPP Loan\") from JP Morgan Chase Bank under the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and\nEconomic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") and was administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\"SBA\"). The proceeds from the PPP Loan were used in\naccordance with the terms of the CARES Act program.\nUnder the terms of the CARES Act, Borrowers could apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or a portion of the PPP Loan. Such forgiveness is determined, subject\nto limitations, based on the use of loan proceeds in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act. The Company was granted total loan forgiveness of $2,331,365 by the\nSBA during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Accrued interest was also forgiven.\n67\nExhibit 10.1.2\nVALUE LINE, INC.\nCLAWBACK POLICY\n(Effective Dec 1, 2023)\nPurpose\nValue Line, Inc. (“VLI”) is establishing this Clawback Policy (this “Policy”) to encourage sound financial reporting and increase individual accountability. This\nPolicy has been adopted by Value Line, Inc.’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and is effective from December 1, 2023 (the “Effective Date”).\nAdministration\nThe Compensation Committee (as constituted from time to time, and including any successor committee, the “Committee”) shall administer this Policy. Subject\nto the provisions of this Policy, the Committee shall make such determinations and interpretations and take such actions in connection with this Policy as it deems\nnecessary or advisable. All determinations and interpretations made by the Committee shall be final, binding and conclusive.\nPolicy\n1. Coverage.\na. Covered Officers. All officers (as defined by Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the regulations promulgated thereunder) are “Covered\nOfficers.” In addition, the Committee may designate other employees as “Covered Officers” (or remove such designations) from time to time. For purposes of this Policy,\nthe term “Covered Officer” means any current Covered Officer.\nb. Covered Compensation Arrangements; Effective Date. This Policy applies to all short- or long-term cash incentives or other incentive compensation, in\neach case the amount, payment and/or vesting of which is calculated based in whole or in part on the application of objective performance criteria in the future.\nMeasured during any part of the period covered by the Restatement (as defined below) (collectively, “Incentive Compensation”). For the avoidance of doubt, none of\nthe following shall be deemed to be Incentive Compensation: salary, bonus considered to be part of salary structure, tax-qualified retirement benefits, elective deferrals\nof salary, programs provided to salaried employees generally in which the level of benefits is not determined by the employee’s level of compensation, and programs\nthat provide a de Minimis amount of compensation, as determined by the Committee. This Policy shall apply only to Incentive Compensation granted on or after the\nEffective Date to a person who is or becomes a current or former Covered Officer after the effective date.\nc. Restatement. For purposes of this Policy, a “Restatement” means an accounting restatement that Value Line, Inc. is required to prepare due to VLI’s material\nnoncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. For the avoidance of doubt, an accounting restatement that occurs as a result of a\nchange in accounting principles shall not be deemed a Restatement.\n2. Exercise of Clawback Authority\nIf a Restatement occurs, the Committee shall review all Incentive Compensation paid to Covered Officers on the basis of having met or exceeded specific\nperformance targets for performance periods during the Restatement period. With respect to each Covered Officer, the Committee shall seek to require the forfeiture or\nrepayment of the amount of Incentive Compensation, during the 3-year period preceding the date on which VLI is required to prepare the Restatement, that is in excess\nof what would have been awarded to and/or paid to the Covered Officer under the Restatement, either (1) if the Covered Officer engaged in fraud or intentional\nmisconduct which materially contributed to the need for the Restatement, or (2) to the extent required by Applicable Rules (defined below) adopted prior to or after the\ngranting of the applicable Incentive Compensation. The Committee may seek forfeiture or recoupment from the Covered Officer from any of the following sources: prior\nIncentive Compensation payments; future Incentive Compensation payments; and direct repayment. Any forfeiture or recoupment under this Policy will be in addition\nto any other remedies that may be available under applicable law or VLI’s policy, including termination of employment or institution of civil proceedings.\n3. Limitations\nThe implementation of action set forth in Section 2 of this Policy shall be limited to the extent that it would violate any applicable statute or government\nregulation or, unless otherwise required by applicable statute or government regulation, (1) result in substantial adverse tax or accounting consequences for VLI, (2)\nprejudice VLI’s interests in any related proceeding or investigation, or (3) reasonably be expected to result in expenses that exceed the amount that would be forfeited\nand/or recouped in exercising such authority. In each case, the Committee will determine the extent of such limitation in its sole discretion.\n4. Acknowledgement by Covered Officers\nThe Committee or its delegate shall provide notice and seek written acknowledgement of this Policy from each Covered Officer as soon as practicable after the\nlater of (i) the Effective Date and (ii) the date on which the employee is designated as a Covered Officer; provided, however, that failure to obtain such acknowledgement\nshall have no impact on the enforceability of this Policy.\n5. Amendment and Termination\nThe Committee may, from time to time, terminate, suspend, discontinue, revise or amend this Policy in any respect whatsoever, and (except as described in the\nimmediately following paragraph) any such amendment will apply to Incentive Compensation granted on or after the effective date of that amendment. Nothing in this\nPolicy will be deemed to limit or restrict VLI from providing for forfeiture or repayment of compensation (including Incentive Compensation) under circumstances not set\nforth in this Policy.\nThis policy shall be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with any applicable rules or regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission and\nthe The NASDAQ Capital Markets pursuant to Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise (the “Applicable Rules”) and any other applicable law\nand shall otherwise be interpreted (including in the determination of amounts recoverable) in the business judgment of the Committee. To the extent the Applicable\nRules require recovery of incentive-based compensation in additional circumstances besides those specified above, nothing in this Policy shall be deemed to limit or\nrestrict VLI’s right or obligation to recover incentive-based compensation to the fullest extent required by the Applicable Rules. This Policy shall be deemed to be\nautomatically amended, as of the date the Applicable Rules become effective with respect to VLI, to the extent required for this Policy to comply with the Applicable\nRules, and any such amendment shall apply to Incentive Compensation granted either before or after that amendment to the extent the Applicable Rules so require.\n6. Indemnification\nNo member of the Board, member of the Committee or employee of VLI in each case exercising such person’s responsibilities under this Policy (each, an\n“Indemnitee”) will have liability to any recipient of an award of Incentive Compensation or any other person for any action taken or omitted to be taken or any\ndetermination made in good faith with respect to this Policy. VLI shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless each Indemnitee from and against any loss, cost, liability or\nexpense (including attorneys’ fees) that may be imposed upon or incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with or resulting from any action, suit or proceeding to\nwhich such Indemnitee may be a party or in which such Indemnitee may be involved by reason of any action taken or omitted to be taken under this Policy and from and\nagainst any and all amounts paid by such Indemnitee, with VLI’s approval, in settlement thereof, or paid by such Indemnitee in satisfaction of any judgment in any such\naction, suit or proceeding against such Indemnitee. The foregoing rights of indemnification, defense, and hold harmless shall not be available to an Indemnitee to the\nextent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment or other final adjudication, in either case, not subject to further appeal, determines that such Indemnitee’s\nacts or omissions giving rise to the indemnification claim resulted from such Indemnitee’s bad faith, fraud or intentional misconduct. The foregoing rights of\nindemnification, defense, and hold harmless will not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which Indemnitees may be entitled under VLI’s Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any other power that VLI may have to indemnify or defend\nsuch persons or hold them harmless. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing right of indemnification, defense, and hold harmless shall not be available to a Covered\nOfficer with respect to the forfeiture or recovery of an incentive compensation award or other payment made to such Covered Officer.\n7. Severability\nIf any provision of this Policy or its application to any Covered Officer shall be adjudicated to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,\nillegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Policy, and the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision shall be deemed amended to the\nminimum extent necessary to render any such provision or application enforceable.\nStephen Davis Al Fiore Glenn Muenzer\nMary Bernstein Howard Brecher Stephen Anastasio\nDated: December 1, 2023\nExhibit 21.1\nSubsidiaries of the Registrant\nState of Percentage of Voting Securities\nIncorporation Owned By Registrant\nValue Line Publishing LLC Delaware 100%\nThe Vanderbilt Advertising Agency, Inc.

Anastasio\nStephen R. Anastasio\nVice President & Treasurer\n(Principal Financial Officer and\nPrincipal Accounting Officer)\nExhibit 99.1\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2024\nIndependent Auditor’s Report\nTo the Trustees of\nEULAV Asset Management\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements (the financial statements) of EULAV Asset Management and Subsidiary (collectively, the\nCompany), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial condition as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations,\nchanges in owners’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EULAV Asset Management and\nSubsidiary as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of their operations, changes in their owners’ equity, and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance\nwith accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are\nfurther described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of\nEULAV Asset Management and Subsidiary and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We\nbelieve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of\nconsolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about EULAV Asset Management and Subsidiary’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated\nfinancial statements are available to be issued.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore\nis not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate,\nthey would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn performing audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:\n● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audits.\n● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures\nresponsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\n● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of EULAV Asset Management and Subsidiary’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is\nexpressed.\n● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about EULAV Asset Management\nand Subsidiary’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit\nfindings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audits.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJuly 10, 2024\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\nApril 30, 2024 April 30, 2023\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,654,405 $ 3,031,624\nInvestments 4,646,593 5,888,419\nReceivable from affiliates 2,812,762 2,093,603\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 391,780 348,716\nTotal current assets 13,505,540 11,362,362\nFurniture and equipment, net 10,342 53,952\nIntangible asset -

(\"VLI\") completing\nthe restructuring of its asset management and broker-dealer businesses (the \"Restructuring Transaction\"). As part of the Restructuring Transaction, EULAV Securities,\nInc., a New York corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of VLI that acted as the distributor of the Value Line mutual funds (\"Value Line Funds\"), merged into EULAV\nSecurities LLC (\"ESLLC\"), a Delaware limited liability company. VLI transferred 100% of its interest in ESLLC to EULAV Asset Management LLC, a wholly‑owned\nsubsidiary of VLI that acted as the investment adviser to the Value Line Funds and certain separate accounts. EULAV Asset Management LLC then converted into\nEAM, which still acts as the investment adviser to the Value Line Funds. ESLLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EAM, is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. ESLLC claims the exemption from the provisions of SEC Rule 15c3-3 under\nparagraph (k)(1).\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EULAV Asset Management and EULAV Securities LLC (collectively, the “Company”) after elimination of\ninter-company balances and transactions.\nVLI granted the Company the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and to supply without charge or expense the Value Line proprietary\nranking system information for so long as the Company is the investment adviser to the Value Line Funds.\nEach of the Value Line Funds has an investment advisory agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company serves as investment adviser to the Value Line\nFunds. The Company receives investment management fees from each of the Value Line Funds managed by the Company. The Company and certain of the Value Line\nFunds have agreed that the Company would waive a portion of the fund's respective advisory fees. The fees received by the Company from the Value Line Funds are net\nof any contractual fee waivers as described in Note D.\nEach of the Value Line Funds has a distribution agreement with the Company's wholly owned subsidiary ESLLC pursuant to which ESLLC acts as principal underwriter\nand distributor of the Value Line Funds for the sale and distribution of their shares. ESLLC is eligible to receive service and distribution fees under Rule 12b-1 of the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940 from the Value Line Funds managed by the Company. ESLLC and certain of the Value Line Funds have agreed to waive all or a portion\nof the fund's respective Rule 12b-1 fees. The fees received by ESLLC from the Value Line Funds are net of any contractual fee waivers as described in Note D.\nESLLC receives sub-transfer agency fees from certain of the Value Line Funds to compensate financial intermediaries that provide sub-transfer agency and related\nservices to investors that hold their fund shares in omnibus accounts maintained by the financial intermediaries with the Value Line Funds.\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n[1] Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n[2] Cash and cash equivalents:\nThe Company considers all cash held at banks and in money market mutual funds to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances in\nmultiple financial institutions which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. In the event of a financial institution's insolvency, recovery of cash may be\nlimited.\n8\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n[3] Revenues:\nThe revenue recognition guidance of ASC Topic 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers\nin an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance requires an entity to\nfollow a five-step model to (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price,\n(d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance\nobligation. In determining the transaction price, an entity may include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the\namount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. All revenues that are\nrecognized in the current period are primarily related to performance obligations that have been satisfied in the same period.\nThe performance obligation relating to investment management fees relates to the management of the Client’s account which is an obligation capable of being\nand distinct within the context of the contracts. The Company believes its performance obligation relating to service, distribution and sub-transfer agency fees is\nthe distribution of the Value Line Funds. This represents a single performance obligation that is continuously provided over the contract period.\nInvestment management fees consist of management fees from the Value Line Funds. Investment management fees for the Value Line Funds are received on a\nmonthly basis as services are performed and the fees, which generally range from 0.35% to 0.74%, are calculated based on average daily net assets of the Value\nLine Funds in accordance with each fund's advisory agreement.\nService and distribution fees are received from the Value Line Funds in accordance with service and distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940. The plans are compensation plans, which means that ESLLC's fees under the plans are payable without regard to actual expenses incurred\nby ESLLC. ESLLC may earn a profit under the plan. Service and distribution fees are earned on a monthly basis and calculated by State Street Bank based on the\naverage daily net assets of each of the Value Line Funds in accordance with each Fund's prospectus. Expenses incurred by ESLLC include payments to securities\ndealers, banks, financial institutions and other organizations that provide distribution, marketing, and related services with respect to the distribution of the Value\nLine Funds' shares.\nSub-transfer agency fees are received from the Value Line Funds in accordance with a sub-transfer agency plan approved by the Board of the Value Line Funds.\nThe sub-transfer agency fee, which may be paid directly to the financial intermediary or indirectly via ESLLC, is equal to the lower of (i) the aggregate amount of\nadditional transfer agency fees and expenses that the Value Line Funds would otherwise pay to the Value Line Funds' transfer agent, if each subaccount in the\nomnibus account maintained by the financial intermediary with the fund were a direct account with the fund and (ii) the amount by which the fees charged by the\nfinancial intermediary for including the fund on its platform and providing shareholder, sub-transfer agency and related services exceed the amount paid under\nthe fund's plan with respect to fund assets attributable to shares held by the financial intermediary in the omnibus account. The Value Line Funds’ Board retains\nthe authority to determine the maximum sub-transfer agency fee that the Distributor may agree to pay to the financial intermediaries under the Sub-Transfer\nAgency and Servicing Plan. If the sub-transfer agency fee is paid to financial intermediaries indirectly via ESLLC, ESLLC does not retain any amount thereof and\nsuch fee otherwise reduces the amount that ESLLC is contractually obligated to pay to the financial intermediary.\n9\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nThe aforementioned fees received from the Value Line Funds and average daily net assets for the Value Line Funds are calculated by State Street Bank, which\nserves as the fund accountant, fund administrator and custodian of the Value Line Funds. The Value Line Funds are open-end management companies registered\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nFuture estimates of payments for revenues are not recognized as there is significant uncertainty as to their amounts, which are dependent upon factors outside\nthe Company’s control, such as fund shareholder activity and market appreciation/depreciation. Additionally, it should be noted that contracts between the\nCompany and its customers do not include performance-based fees.\nThe Company considers that recognizing revenue for both management fees, service and distribution fees, and sub-transfer agency fees over time best represents\nthe transfer of control to the customer for management investment activities. The Company considers that time elapsed to be the method that best represents the\ntransfer of control to the customer for management investment activities.\nRevenue from contracts with affiliates For the Year Ended April 30,\n2024 2023\nService and distribution\nService and distribution fees $ 5,260,413 $ 4,680,073\nSub-transfer agency fees 1,323,917 1,283,587\nTotal service and distribution revenue 6,584,330 5,963,660\nInvestment management fees\nInvestment management fees 24,383,243 19,823,681\nTotal revenue from contracts with affiliates $ 30,967,573 $ 25,787,341\nThe revenue from contracts with customers is derived from the Value Line Funds. For the year ended April 30, 2024, approximately 29% of the investment\nmanagement fees are derived from the Value Line Mid-Cap Focused Fund. For the year ended April 30, 2023, approximately 34% of the investment management\nfees are derived from the Value Line Asset Allocation Fund.\n[4] Income taxes:\nThe Company, as a trust, has elected to be taxed as a pass-through entity similar to a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and, accordingly, is not\nsubject to federal and state income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax.\nThe Company may recognize tax benefits from any uncertain positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by\nthe taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties in general and administration\nexpense. The Company had no uncertain tax positions that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements and has not recognized in these\nconsolidated financial statements any interest or penalties related to income taxes. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations by tax\nauthorities. The previous three years remain open for audit.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required when evaluating tax\nprovisions and related uncertainties. Future events such as changes in tax legislation could require a provision for income taxes. Any such changes could\nsignificantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations.\n10\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n[5] Intangible assets:\nThe value of the intangible asset received as part of the Restructuring Transaction was derived primarily from revenue streams to be earned from management\ncontracts contributed and from the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and access the Value Line Proprietary Ranking information.\nAs of April 30, 2024 and 2023, this intangible asset was valued at approximately $49,197,000. It is tested for impairment annually. It has an indefinite useful life and\nis not being amortized. VLI utilized the services of a third party valuation firm (the \"Valuator\") to assist in the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset\nat the time of the Restructuring Transaction.\nThe value of the intangible asset received as part of a fund transaction that occurred in 2016 was derived from the value of the assets in the fund and the value of\ntwo selling agreements that were acquired in the transaction. The intangible asset was valued at approximately $350,000 as of April 30, 2024 and 2023. It is being\namortized over a 15 year useful life. As of April 30, 2024, the value is approximately $72,000, and accumulated amortization is approximately $278,000. The amount\nof amortization for the year ended April 30, 2024 was approximately $10,000. As of April 30, 2023, the value is approximately $82,000, and accumulated amortization\nis approximately $268,000. The amount of amortization for the year ended April 30, 2023 was approximately $10,000.\nEAM utilizes the services of the Valuator to assist in the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset each fiscal year. The Valuator employed several\nanalytical methodologies which were used by the Company to assist in its determination of the fair value of the intangible asset. These methodologies included\ntwo market approach methods which referenced actual transactions in the equity of similar enterprises that are traded in private and public markets and one\nincome approach method utilizing discounted cash flows to determine the present value of the future earning capacity that is available to investors in the entity.\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of its intangible asset by determining whether the carrying amount can be recovered through discounted forecasted\ncash flows if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If discounted forecasted cash flows indicate that the carrying amount\nwill not be recovered, an adjustment will be made to reduce such amounts to fair value based on forecasted future cash discounted at a rate commensurate with\nthe risk associated with achieving such cash flows. Future cash flows are based on trends of historical performance and the Company's estimate of future\nperformance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions. The Company has elected to perform its annual analysis at\nApril 30, its fiscal year-end. No indicators of impairment were identified during the years ended April 30, 2024 or April 30, 2023.\n[6] Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nIn accordance with Fair Value Accounting, the Company has categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique,\ninto a three-level fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Condition are categorized based on the inputs to the\nvaluation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\nLevel 2: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly\nor indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to\nthe overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumption about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset\nor liability.\n11\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets by level within the fair value hierarchy at April 30, 2024:\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash and cash\nequivalents $ 5,654,405 $ 5,654,405 $ - $ - $ 5,654,405\nInvestments $ 4,646,593 3,656,947 989,646 - 4,646,593\nReceivable from affiliates $ 2,812,762 - 2,812,762 - 2,812,762\nTotal Assets $ 13,113,760 $ 9,311,352 $ 3,802,408 $ - $ 13,113,760\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable and\naccrued liabilities $ 1,322,243 $ - $ 1,322,243 $ - $ 1,322,243\nTotal Liabilities $ 1,322,243 $ - $ 1,322,243 $ - $ 1,322,243\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets by level within the fair value hierarchy at April 30, 2023:\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash and cash\nequivalents $ 3,031,624 $ 3,031,624 $ - $ - $ 3,031,624\nInvestments $ 5,888,419 2,928,971 2,959,448 - 5,888,419\nReceivable from affiliates $ 2,093,603 - 2,093,603 - 2,093,603\nTotal Assets $ 11,013,646 $ 5,960,595 $ 5,053,051 $ - $ 11,013,646\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable and\naccrued liabilities $ 930,553 $ - $ 930,553 $ - $ 930,553\nTotal Liabilities $ 930,553 $ - $ 930,553 $ - $ 930,553\nThe classification of financial instruments valued at fair value as of April 30 is as follows:\n2024 2023\nFixed income $ 989,646 $ 2,959,447\nMutual funds/ETFs 2,835,070 2,293,037\nEquities 821,877 635,935\n$ 4,646,593 $ 5,888,419\nMutual funds/ETFs and equity securities are valued on the last business day of the period at the last available reported price on their primary securities exchange.\nThe Company has approximately $551,000 and $542,000, respectively, invested in the Value Line Funds as of April 30, 2024 and 2023.\n12\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2024, the Company recorded change in unrealized gain on investments for approximately $73,000 and realized gain on investments\nin the amount of approximately $48,000 within change in unrealized gain/loss and realized gain on investments within the Statement of Operations. During the year\nended April 30, 2023, the Company recorded change in unrealized loss on investments for approximately $56,000 and realized gain on investments in the amount of\napproximately $53,000 within change in unrealized gain/loss and realized gain on investments within the Statement of Operations. The Company uses the Average\nCost methodology to determine realized gain/(loss) on investments.\n[7] New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 842, Leases (ASC 842) which amended the existing accounting standards for\nlease accounting and required most leases (including operating leases) to be capitalized on the statement of financial condition. Effective May 1, 2021, the\nCompany adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach and elected to adopt the package of optional transition related practical expedients, which\namong other things, allows the Company to carry forward certain historical conclusions reached under ASC 840 regarding lease identification, classification, and\nthe accounting treatment of initial direct costs. Furthermore, the Company elected not to record assets and liabilities on its statement of financial condition for\nnew or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less.\nThe Company is a lessee in two long term operating leases for office space that are subject to this new standard (see Note I – Commitment). Right of use assets\nand corresponding liabilities are recognized on the Company’s statement of financial condition based on the present value of future lease payments relating to the\nuse of the underlying asset during the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate in determining the present value of future\nlease payments, as the interest rates implicit in its lease arrangements were not readily determinable.\nNOTE C - OWNERS' EQUITY\nClass A and Class B interest holders are Trustees and holders of the voting profits interests of the Company, and Value Line, Inc. (\"VLI\") owns the non-voting revenue\ninterests and the non-voting profits interests of the Company.\nCollectively, the voting profits interests receive 50% of the residual profit of the business, in which the share of Class A voting profits interest is 45% and Class B voting\nprofits interest is 5%, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances, as defined in the Trust agreement. VLI retains a nonvoting profits interest representing\n50% of residual profits, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances and has no power to vote for the election, removal or replacement of the Trustees of\nthe Company. VLI also retains a Non-Voting Revenues Interest in the business ranging from 41% at non-distribution fee (certain investment management fees) revenue\nlevels of $9 million or less to 55% at such revenue levels of $35 million or more. The Company will make distributions to the owners and holders of the revenue interests\nno later than the tenth day after each respective quarter end, as defined in the Trust agreement.\n13\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe investment management fees, 12b-1 fees, and sub-transfer agency fees, as described in Note A, are received from the Value Line Funds and are reflected within\nreceivable from affiliates on the consolidated statement of financial condition. For the year ended April 30, 2024 and 2023, total investment management fee waivers and\nreimbursements were approximately $288,000 and $164,000 and total service and distributions fee waivers were approximately $94,000 and $105,000, respectively.\nSubstantially all the revenue is generated from related parties.\nNOTE E - FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT\nFurniture and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to seven years. For the year\nended April 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation expense was approximately $38,000 and $41,000, respectively.\nFurniture and equipment, net, consist of the following (rounded):\n2024 2023\nFurniture and equipment $ 284,000 $ 320,000\nLess: accumulated depreciation (274,000) (266,000)\n$ 10,000 $ 54,000\nNOTE F - REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nFor regulatory purposes, ESLLC is subject to the net capital provisions of Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the maintenance of\nminimum net capital of $5,000 or one-fifteenth of aggregate indebtedness, if greater. At April 30, 2024, ESLLC's net capital, as defined, of approximately $954,000\nexceeded required net capital by approximately $906,000 and the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was .76 to 1. At April 30, 2023, ESLLC's net capital, as\ndefined, of approximately $915,000 exceeded required net capital by approximately $869,000 and the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was .75 to 1.\nNOTE G - EMPLOYEES' PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN\nThe employees of the Company are eligible to be members of the Company's 401(k) Plan and Profit Sharing Plan. In general, the Company matched 50% of the first 4%\nand 100% of the next 2% of each eligible employee's salary for the 401(k) Plan and may at its discretion contribute to the Profit Sharing Plan. For the year ended April 30,\n2023, the Company made approximately $159,000 and $145,000 in matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan and its Profit Sharing Plan for the years ended April 30, 2024\nand 2023, respectively. This amount was included in compensation and benefits on the consolidated statement of operations.\nNOTE H - CO-EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT\nThe Company has a client service agreement with ADP TotalSource as Co-employer (as defined in the client service agreement). ADP TotalSource is an unrelated entity.\nThe Company's employees are on the Co‑employer's payroll and withholding system which is responsible for providing the payroll and tax withholding payments and\nreports for the Company's employees. In exchange, the Co-employer receives an administrative fee amounting to approximately $71,000 and $42,000 for the years ended\nApril 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n14\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2024\nNOTE I - COMMITMENT\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into a five year Lease Agreement with Boston Properties to lease office space at 7 Times Square, 16th Floor, New York NY 10036,\nwith the lease expiring November 2024. In March 2021, the Company entered into a two year Lease Agreement with Sarasota Ellis Associates LLC to lease office space at\n1610 Main Street, Suite 912, Sarasota Florida 34236. In April 2022, the Sarasota lease agreement was extended three years. Future rental commitment under the Leases as\nof April 30, 2024, are as follows:\nYear Ending\nApril 30, Amount\n2025 $ 277,528\n2026 32,028\n$ 309,556\nWeighted Average maturity (in years) 0.76\nWeighted average rate 3.5%\nImputed interest $ 12,000\nLease liabilities $ 309,556\nRent expense charged to operations for the years ended April 30, 2024 and 2023 was $443,000 and $430,000, respectively, which was included in office and administration\non the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 on May 1, 2021.

The adverse impact of any one or more of these events on the Company could be significant and cause losses. The Company cannot predict the\nlikelihood of occurrence or the effects of pandemics and epidemics in the future and the Company’s financial performance may be adversely affected.\n15\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPRIL 30, 2022\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT\nTo the Trustees of\nEULAV Asset Management\nOpinion\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of EULAV Asset Management and Subsidiary (the “Company”), which comprise the\nconsolidated statement of financial condition as of April 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in owners’ equity and cash flows for\nthe year then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of EULAV Asset\nManagement and Subsidiary as of April 30, 2022, and the results of their consolidated operations, the changes in their owners’ equity and their cash flows for the years\nthen ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Our responsibilities under those standards are\nfurther described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the Company\nand to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of\nfinancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise\nsubstantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued.\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to\nfraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore\nis not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of\nnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,\nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate,\nthey would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn performing an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, we:\n☐ Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n☐ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit\nprocedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n☐ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the\npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n☐ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.\n☐ Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about Company’s ability to\ncontinue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\nWe are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit\nfindings, and certain internal control related matters that we identified during the audit.\nBBD, LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nJune 22, 2022\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nConsolidated Statement of Financial Condition\nApril 30, 2022\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents $ 8,222,385\nInvestments 2,046,285\nReceivable from affiliates 2,532,808\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 329,567\nTotal current assets 13,131,045\nFurniture and equipment, net 89,807\nIntangible asset - management contracts 49,288,784\nRight of use assets 1,082,826\nTotal assets $ 63,592,462\nLIABILITIES AND OWNERS' EQUITY\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities $ 1,228,991\nDue to owners – distributions 3,915,378\nCurrent lease liabilities 415,403\nTotal current liabilities 5,559,772\nNon-current lease liabilities 722,490\nOwners' equity 57,310,200\nTotal liabilities and owners’ equity $ 63,592,462\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n4\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nConsolidated Statement of Operations\nFor the Year Ended April 30, 2022\nRevenues:\nInvestment management fees $ 29,597,929\nService and distribution fees 7,768,277\nSub-transfer agency fees 1,541,786\nDividends, interest and other income 79,529\nChange in unrealized gain/loss and realized gain on investments (99,835)\nTotal revenues 38,887,686\nExpenses:\nMarketing and distribution 10,509,024\nCompensation and benefits 5,971,629\nOffice and administration 1,806,860\nProfessional fees 403,701\nTotal expenses 18,691,214\nNet income before New York City income taxes 20,196,472\nProvision for New York City income taxes 14,449\nNet income $ 20,182,023\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n5\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nConsolidated Statement of Changes in Owners' Equity\nFor the Year Ended April 30, 2022\nApril 30, Net April 30,\n2021 Income Distributions 2022\nNon-voting revenue interest and non-voting profit interest $ 56,313,110 $ 18,040,392 $ (18,039,339) $ 56,314,163\nClass A voting profit interest 995,174 1,927,468 (1,943,835) 978,807\nClass B voting profit interest 18,795 214,163 (215,728) 17,230\n$ 57,327,079 $ 20,182,023 $ (20,198,902) $ 57,310,200\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n6\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nFor the Year Ended April 30, 2022\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet income $ 20,182,023\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nChange in unrealized gain and realized gain on investments 99,835\nDepreciation and amortization expense 57,332\nChanges in:\nReceivable from affiliates 757,229\nPrepaid expenses and other assets 71,711\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities (358,715)\nRight of use asset (1,082,826)\nLease liability 1,137,893\nDeferred rent (62,338)\nNet cash provided by operating activities 20,802,144\nCash flows from investing activities:\nPurchase of investments (2,363,259)\nProceeds from investments 2,168,303\nNet cash used in investing activities (194,956)\nCash flows used in financing activities:\nDistributions, net of change in due to owners - distributions (21,503,104)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (895,916)\nCash and cash equivalents - April 30, 2021 9,118,301\nCash and cash equivalents - April 30, 2022 $ 8,222,385\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information:\nCash paid for New York City income taxes $ 18,000\nNon-cash financing activities:\nChange in Due to owners - distributions $ (1,304,202)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n7\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE A - ORGANIZATION AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES\nEULAV Asset Management (“EAM\"), a Delaware statutory trust, with no fixed term, was formed on December 23, 2010 as a result of Value Line, Inc. (\"VLI\") completing\nthe restructuring of its asset management and broker-dealer businesses (the \"Restructuring Transaction\"). As part of the Restructuring Transaction, EULAV Securities,\nInc., a New York corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of VLI that acted as the distributor of the Value Line mutual funds (\"Value Line Funds\"), merged into EULAV\nSecurities LLC (\"ESLLC\"), a Delaware limited liability company. VLI transferred 100% of its interest in ESLLC to EULAV Asset Management LLC, a wholly‑owned\nsubsidiary of VLI that acted as the investment adviser to the Value Line Funds and certain separate accounts. EULAV Asset Management LLC then converted into\nEAM, which still acts as the investment adviser to the Value Line Funds. ESLLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EAM, is a broker-dealer registered with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. ESLLC claims the exemption from the provisions of SEC Rule 15c3-3 under\nparagraph (k)(1).\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of EULAV Asset Management and EULAV Securities LLC (collectively, the “Company”) after elimination of\ninter-company balances and transactions.\nVLI granted the Company the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and to supply without charge or expense the Value Line proprietary\nranking system information for so long as the Company is the investment adviser to the Value Line Funds.\nEach of the Value Line Funds has an investment advisory agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Company serves as investment adviser to the Value Line\nFunds. The Company receives investment management fees from each of the Value Line Funds managed by the Company. The Company and certain of the Value Line\nFunds have agreed that the Company would waive a portion of the fund's respective advisory fees. The fees received by the Company from the Value Line Funds are net\nof any contractual fee waivers as described in Note D.\nEach of the Value Line Funds has a distribution agreement with the Company's wholly owned subsidiary ESLLC pursuant to which ESLLC acts as principal underwriter\nand distributor of the Value Line Funds for the sale and distribution of their shares. ESLLC is eligible to receive service and distribution fees under Rule 12b-1 of the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940 from the Value Line Funds managed by the Company. ESLLC and certain of the Value Line Funds have agreed to waive all or a portion\nof the Fund's respective Rule 12b-1 fees. The fees received by ESLLC from the Value Line Funds are net of any contractual fee waivers as described in Note D.\nESLLC receives sub-transfer agency fees from certain of the Value Line Funds to compensate financial intermediaries that provide sub-transfer agency and related\nservices to investors that hold their fund shares in omnibus accounts maintained by the financial intermediaries with the Value Line Funds.\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n[1] Use of estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\n[2] Cash and cash equivalents:\nThe Company considers all cash held at banks and in money market mutual funds to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash balances in a\nfinancial institution which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. In the event of a financial institution's insolvency, recovery of cash may be limited.\n8\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n[3] Revenues:\nThe revenue recognition guidance of ASC Topic 606 requires that an entity recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers\nin an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance requires an entity to\nfollow a five-step model to (a) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (b) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (c) determine the transaction price,\n(d) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (e) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance\nobligation. In determining the transaction price, an entity may include variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the\namount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. All revenues that are\nrecognized in the current period are primarily related to performance obligations that have been satisfied in the same period.\nThe performance obligation relating to investment management fees relates to the management of the Client’s account which is an obligation capable of being and\ndistinct within the context of the contracts. The Company believes its performance obligation relating to service, distribution and sub-transfer agency fees is the\ndistribution of the Value Line Funds. This represents a single performance obligation that is continuously provided over the contract period.\nInvestment management fees consist of management fees from the Value Line Funds. Investment management fees for the Value Line Funds are received on a\nmonthly basis as services are performed and the fees, which generally range from 0.35% to 0.74%, are calculated based on average daily net assets of the Value\nLine Funds in accordance with each fund's advisory agreement.\nService and distribution fees are received from the Value Line Funds in accordance with service and distribution plans under Rule 12b-1 of the Investment\nCompany Act of 1940. The plans are compensation plans, which means that ESLLC's fees under the plans are payable without regard to actual expenses incurred\nby ESLLC. ESLLC may earn a profit under the plan. Service and distribution fees are earned on a monthly basis and calculated by State Street Bank based on the\naverage daily net assets of each of the Value Line Funds in accordance with each Fund's prospectus. Expenses incurred by ESLLC include payments to securities\ndealers, banks, financial institutions and other organizations that provide distribution, marketing, and related services with respect to the distribution of the Value\nLine Funds' shares.\nSub-transfer agency fees are received from the Value Line Funds in accordance with a sub-transfer agency plan approved by the Board of the Value Line Funds.\nThe sub-transfer agency fee, which may be paid directly to the financial intermediary or indirectly via ESLLC, is equal to the lower of (i) the aggregate amount of\nadditional transfer agency fees and expenses that the Value Line Funds would otherwise pay to the Value Line Funds' transfer agent, if each subaccount in the\nomnibus account maintained by the financial intermediary with the fund were a direct account with the fund and (ii) the amount by which the fees charged by the\nfinancial intermediary for including the fund on its platform and providing shareholder, sub-transfer agency and related services exceed the amount paid under the\nfund's plan with respect to fund assets attributable to shares held by the financial intermediary in the omnibus account. If the sub-transfer agency fee is paid to\nfinancial intermediaries indirectly via ESLLC, ESLLC does not retain any amount thereof and such fee otherwise reduces the amount that ESLLC is contractually\nobligated to pay to the financial intermediary.\n9\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nThe aforementioned fees received from the Value Line Funds and average daily net assets for the Value Line Funds are calculated by State Street Bank, which\nserves as the fund accountant, fund administrator and custodian of the Value Line Funds. The Value Line Funds are open-end management companies registered\nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nFuture estimates of payments for revenues are not recognized as there is significant uncertainty as to their amounts, which are dependent upon factors outside\nthe Company’s control, such as fund shareholder activity and market appreciation/depreciation. Additionally, it should be noted that contracts between the\nCompany and its customers do not include performance-based fees.\nThe Company considers that recognizing revenue for both management fees, service and distribution fees, and sub-transfer agency fees over time best represents\nthe transfer of control to the customer for management investment activities. The Company considers that time elapsed to be the method that best represents the\ntransfer of control to the customer for management investment activities.\nRevenue from contracts with affiliates\nService and distribution\nService and distribution fees $ 7,768,277\nSub-transfer agency fees 1,541,786\nTotal service and distribution revenue 9,310,063\nInvestment management fees\nInvestment management fees $ 29,597,929\nTotal investment management fees 29,597,929\nTotal revenue from contracts with affiliates $ 38,907,992\nThe revenue from contracts with customers is derived from the Value Line Funds and for the year ended April 30, 2022, approximately 35% of the investment\nmanagement fees are derived from the Value Line Asset Allocation Fund.\n[4] Income taxes:\nThe Company, as a trust, has elected to be taxed as a pass-through entity similar to a partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and, accordingly, is not\nsubject to federal and state income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax.\nThe Company may recognize tax benefits from any uncertain positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by\nthe taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and penalties in general and administration\nexpense. The Company had no uncertain tax positions that would require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements and has not recognized in these\nconsolidated financial statements any interest or penalties related to income taxes. The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations by tax\nauthorities. The previous three years remain open for audit.\nTax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required when evaluating tax\nprovisions and related uncertainties. Future events such as changes in tax legislation could require a provision for income taxes. Any such changes could\nsignificantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statement of operations.\n10\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\n[5] Intangible assets:\nThe value of the intangible asset received as part of the Restructuring Transaction was derived primarily from revenue streams to be earned from management\ncontracts contributed and from the right to use the Value Line name for all existing Value Line Funds and access the Value Line Proprietary Ranking information.\nThis intangible asset was valued at approximately $49,197,000 and it is tested for impairment annually. It has an indefinite useful life and is not being amortized.\nVLI utilized the services of a third party valuation firm (the \"Valuator\") to assist in the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset at the time of the\nRestructuring Transaction.\nThe value of the intangible asset received as part of a fund transaction that occurred in 2016 was derived from the value of the assets in the fund and the value of\ntwo selling agreements that were acquired in the transaction. The intangible asset was valued at approximately $350,000 and is being amortized over a 15 year\nuseful life. As of April 30, 2022, the value is approximately $92,000, and accumulated amortization is approximately $258,000. The amount of amortization for the\nyear ended April 30, 2022 was approximately $10,000.\nEAM utilizes the services of the Valuator to assist in the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset each fiscal year. The Valuator employed several\nanalytical methodologies which were used by the Company to assist in its determination of the fair value of the intangible asset. These methodologies included\ntwo market approach methods which referenced actual transactions in the equity of similar enterprises that are traded in private and public markets and one\nincome approach method utilizing discounted cash flows to determine the present value of the future earning capacity that is available to investors in the entity.\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of its intangible asset by determining whether the carrying amount can be recovered through discounted forecasted\ncash flows if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If discounted forecasted cash flows indicate that the carrying amount\nwill not be recovered, an adjustment will be made to reduce such amounts to fair value based on forecasted future cash discounted at a rate commensurate with\nthe risk associated with achieving such cash flows. Future cash flows are based on trends of historical performance and the Company's estimate of future\nperformance, giving consideration to existing and anticipated competitive and economic conditions. The Company has elected to perform its annual analysis at\nApril 30, its fiscal year-end. No indicators of impairment were identified during the year ended April 30, 2022.\n[6] Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nIn accordance with Fair Value Accounting, the Company has categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique,\ninto a three-level fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the Statement of Financial Condition are categorized based on the inputs to the\nvaluation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market.\nLevel 2: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs that are observable either directly\nor indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3: Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to\nthe overall fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management’s own assumption about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset\nor liability.\n11\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets by level within the fair value hierarchy at April 30, 2022:\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash and cash\nequivalents $ 8,222,385 $ 8,222,385 $ - $ - $ 8,222,385\nInvestments $ 2,046,285 1,672,190 374,095 - 2,046,285\nReceivable from\naffiliates $ 2,532,808 - 2,532,808 - 2,532,808\nPrepaid expenses and\nother assets $ 329,567 - 329,567 - 329,567\nTotal Assets $ 13,131,045 $ 9,894,575 $ 3,236,470 $ - $ 13,131,045\nCarrying Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLiabilities:\nAccounts payable and\naccrued liabilities $ 1,228,991 $ - $ 1,228,991 $ - $ 1,228,991\nTotal Liabilities $ 1,228,991 $ - $ 1,228,991 $ - $ 1,228,991\nThe classification of financial instruments valued at fair value as of April 30, 2022 is as follows:\nMutual funds/ETFs $ 999,912\nEquities 672,278\nFixed income 374,095\n$ 2,046,285\nMutual funds/ETFs and equity securities are valued on the last business day of the period at the last available reported price on their primary securities exchange.\nThe Company has approximately $522,000 invested in the Value Line Funds as of April 30, 2022.\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2022, the Company recorded change in unrealized loss on investments for approximately $162,000 and realized gain on\ninvestments in the amount of approximately $62,000 within change in unrealized gain/loss and realized gain on investments within the Statement of Operations.\nThe Company uses the Average Cost methodology to determine realized gain/(loss) on investments.\n[7] New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 842, Leases (ASC 842) which amended the existing accounting standards for\nlease accounting and required most leases (including operating leases) to be capitalized on the statement of financial condition. Effective May 1, 2021, the\nCompany adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective approach and elected to adopt the package of optional transition related practical expedients, which\namong other things, allows the Company to carry forward certain historical conclusions reached under ASC 840 regarding lease identification, classification, and\nthe accounting treatment of initial direct costs. Furthermore, the Company elected not to record assets and liabilities on its statement of financial condition for\nnew or existing lease arrangements with terms of 12 months or less.\n12\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nThe Company is a lessee in two long term operating leases for office space that are subject to this new standard (see Note I – Commitment). Right of use assets\nand corresponding liabilities are recognized on the Company’s statement of financial condition based on the present value of future lease payments relating to the\nuse of the underlying asset during the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate in determining the present value of future\nlease payments, as the interest rates implicit in its lease arrangements were not readily determinable.\nNOTE C - OWNERS' EQUITY\nClass A and Class B interest holders are Trustees and holders of the voting profits interests of the Company, and Value Line, Inc. (\"VLI\") owns the non-voting revenue\ninterests and the non-voting profits interests of the Company.\nCollectively, the voting profits interests receive 50% of the residual profit of the business, in which the share of Class A voting profits interest is 45% and Class B voting\nprofits interest is 5%, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances, as defined in the Trust agreement. VLI retains a nonvoting profits interest representing\n50% of residual profits, subject to temporary adjustments in certain circumstances and has no power to vote for the election, removal or replacement of the Trustees of\nthe Company. VLI also retains a Non-Voting Revenues Interest in the business ranging from 41% at non-distribution fee (certain investment management fees) revenue\nlevels of $9 million or less to 55% at such revenue levels of $35 million or more. The Company will make distributions to the owners and holders of the revenue interests\nno later than the tenth day after each respective quarter end, as defined in the Trust agreement.\nNOTE D - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe investment management fees, 12b-1 fees, and sub-transfer agency fees, as described in Note A, are received from the Value Line Funds and are reflected within\nreceivable from affiliates on the consolidated statement of financial condition. For the year ended April 30, 2022, total investment management fee waivers and\nreimbursements were approximately $547,000 and total service and distributions fee waivers were approximately $644,000. Substantially all the revenue is generated from\nrelated parties.\nNOTE E - FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT\nFurniture and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of three to seven years. For the year\nended April 30, 2022, depreciation expense was approximately $47,000.\nFurniture and equipment, net, consist of the following:\nFurniture and equipment $ 349,268\nLess: accumulated depreciation (259,461)\n$ 89,807\n13\nEULAV ASSET MANAGEMENT\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nApril 30, 2022\nNOTE F - REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nFor regulatory purposes, ESLLC is subject to the net capital provisions of Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the maintenance of\nminimum net capital of $5,000 or one-fifteenth of aggregate indebtedness, if greater. At April 30, 2022, ESLLC's net capital, as defined, of approximately $1,580,000\nexceeded required net capital by approximately $1,532,000 and the ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was .45 to 1.\nNOTE G - EMPLOYEES' PROFIT SHARING AND SAVINGS PLAN\nThe employees of the Company are eligible to be members of the Company's 401(k) Plan and Profit Sharing Plan. In general, the Company matched 50% of the first 4%\nand 100% of the next 2% of each eligible employee's salary for the 401(k) Plan and may at its discretion contribute to the Profit Sharing Plan. For the year ended April 30,\n2022, the Company made approximately $218,000 in matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan and its Profit Sharing Plan. This amount was included in compensation and\nbenefits on the consolidated statement of operations.\nNOTE H - CO-EMPLOYEE AGREEMENT\nThe Company has a client service agreement with ADP TotalSource as Co-employer (as defined in the client service agreement). ADP TotalSource is an unrelated entity.\nThe Company's employees are on the Co‑employer's payroll and withholding system which is responsible for providing the payroll and tax withholding payments and\nreports for the Company's employees. In exchange, the Co-employer receives an administrative fee amounting to approximately $48,000 for the year ended April 30, 2022.\nNOTE I - COMMITMENT\nIn August 2019, the Company entered into a five year Lease Agreement with Boston Properties to lease office space at 7 Times Square, 16th Floor, New York NY 10036.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a two year Lease Agreement with Sarasota Ellis Associates LLC to lease office space at 1610 Main Street, Suite 912, Sarasota\nFlorida 34236.

The primary impact of applying ASC 842 was the initial recognition of $1,428,000 lease liabilities and $1,365,000 right of\nuse assets on the Company’s financial statements, for leases classified as operating leases under ASC 840, using an incremental borrowing rate of 3.50%. There is no\ncumulative effect on retained earnings or other components of equity recognized as of May 1, 2021.

(\"Value Line\" or \"VLI\", and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is incorporated in the State of New York. The name \"Value Line\" as used to\ndescribe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals\nand their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary\ninformation, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. The Company maintains\na significant investment in Eulav Asset Management LLC (\"EAM\") from which it receives a non-voting revenues interest and a non-voting profits interest. Pursuant\nto the EAM Declaration of Trust dated as of December 23, 2010 (the \"EAM Trust Agreement\"), VLI granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name for all existing\nValue Line Funds and agreed to supply, without charge or expense, the Value Line Proprietary Ranking System information to EAM for use in managing the Value Line\nFunds. EAM was established to provide investment management services to the Value Line Mutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\" or the \"Funds\").\nThe Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, which have been derived from the unaudited interim Consolidated Condensed\nFinancial Statements and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, were prepared following the interim reporting requirements of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contain all\nadjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals except as noted below) considered necessary for a fair presentation. This report should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2024 filed with the SEC\non July 26, 2024 (the “Form 10-K”). Results of operations covered by this report may not be indicative of the results of operations for the entire year.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe Company follows the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Topic 810 “Consolidation” to determine if it should consolidate its\ninvestment in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). A VIE is a legal entity in which either (i) equity investors do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to enable the\nentity to finance its activities independently or (ii) the equity holders at risk lack the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns or the right to make\ndecisions about the entity’s activities that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance. A holder of a variable interest in a VIE is required to consolidate\nthe entity if it is determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary. The determination of a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is based on a qualitative assessment to identify the variable interest holder, if any, that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. The accounting guidance requires the Company to perform an ongoing assessment of whether the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE and the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE (see Note 3).\nIn accordance with FASB's Topic 810, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest have been\nconsolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company holds a significant non-voting revenues\ninterest (excluding distribution revenues) and a significant non-voting profits interest in EULAV Asset Management, a Delaware statutory trust (“EAM” or “EAM\nTrust”). The Company relied on the guidance in FASB's ASC Topics 323 and 810 in its determination not to consolidate its investment in EAM and to account for such\ninvestment under the equity method of accounting. The Company reports the amount it earns for its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests as a separate\nline item below operating income in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income.\nRevenue Recognition:\nDepending upon the product, subscription fulfillment for Value Line periodicals and related publications is available in print or digitally, via internet access. The length\nof a subscription varies by product and offer received by the subscriber. Generally, subscriptions are offered as annual subscriptions with the majority of subscriptions\npaid in advance. Subscription revenues, net of discounts, are recognized ratably on a straight line basis when the product is served to the client over the life of the\nsubscription. Accordingly, the amount of subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of the balance sheets are shown as unearned revenue\nwithin current and long-term liabilities.\nCopyright fees are derived from providing certain Value Line trademarks and the Value Line Proprietary Ranks to third parties under written agreements for use in\nselecting securities for third party marketed products, including unit investment trusts, annuities and exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\"). The Company earns asset-based\ncopyright fees upon delivery to the customer as specified in the individual agreements. Revenue is recognized monthly and received either quarterly or in advance over\nthe term of the agreement and, because it is asset-based, will fluctuate as the market value of the underlying portfolio increases or decreases in value.\nEAM earns investment management fees from the Value Line Funds. The management fees and average daily net assets for the Value Line Funds are calculated by State\nStreet Bank, which serves as the fund accountant, fund administrator, and custodian of the Value Line Funds.\nThe Value Line Funds are open-end management companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"1940 Act\"). Shareholder transactions for the\nValue Line Funds are processed each business day by the third party transfer agent of the Funds. Shares can be redeemed without advance notice upon request of the\nshareowners each day that the New York Stock Exchange is open.\n9\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities:\nThe Company accounts for its investment in its unconsolidated entity, EAM, using the equity method of accounting in accordance with FASB’s ASC 323. The equity\nmethod is an appropriate means of recognizing increases or decreases measured by GAAP in the economic resources underlying the investments. Under the equity\nmethod, an investor recognizes its share of the earnings or losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements\nrather than in the period in which an investee declares a dividend or distribution. An investor adjusts the carrying amount of an investment for its share of the earnings\nor losses recognized by the investee.\nThe Company’s “interests” in EAM, the investment adviser to and the sole member of the distributor of the Value Line Funds, consist of a \"non-voting revenues\ninterest\" and a \"non-voting profits interest\" in EAM as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement. The non-voting revenues interest entitles the Company to receive a range\nof 41% to 55%, based on the amount of EAM’s adjusted gross revenues, excluding EULAV Securities' distribution revenues (“Revenues Interest”). The non-voting\nprofits interest entitles the Company to receive 50% of EAM's profits, subject to certain limited adjustments as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement (“Profits Interest”).\nThe Revenues Interest and at least 90% of the Profits Interest are to be distributed each quarter to all interest holders of EAM, including Value Line. The Company's\nRevenues Interest in EAM excludes participation in the service and distribution fees of EAM's subsidiary EULAV Securities. The Company reflects its non-voting\nrevenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM as non-operating income under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company does not have control over\nthe operating and financial policies of EAM, pursuant to the EAM Trust Agreement, the Company has a contractual right to receive its share of EAM's revenues and\nprofits.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements:\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires\ndisclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied on a\nretrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are\nevaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional\ndisclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate\nreconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax\ncredits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and\njurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual\njurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Securities:\nThe Company's securities classified as cash equivalents, equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities consist of shares of money market funds that\ninvest primarily in short-term U.S. Government securities, investments in equities including ETFs and fixed income securities invested primarily in short-term U.S.\nTreasury bills, and to a smaller extent bank certificates of deposit that are valued in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the\nFASB's ASC 820. The securities classified as equity securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and\nlosses are recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income per FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (\"ASU 2016-01\"). The securities\nclassified as available-for-sale fixed income securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses, net\nof applicable taxes, are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Investment gains and losses on sales of the equity securities are the difference\nbetween proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Investment gains and losses on sales\nof the available-for-sale fixed income securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the cost of the securities. Investment gains and losses on sales of all\nsecurities are recorded in earnings as of the trade date and are determined on the identified cost method.\n10\nThe Company classifies its equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities as current assets to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the fact that\nit has liquid assets available-for-sale should the need arise.\nMarket valuations of securities listed on a securities exchange and ETF shares are based on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month. The market\nvalue of the Company's fixed maturity U.S. Government debt securities is determined utilizing publicly quoted market prices. Cash equivalents consist of investments in\nmoney market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Government securities valued in accordance with rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.\nThe Fair Value Measurements Topic of FASB's ASC defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in a timely transaction to\nan independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. The Fair Value Measurements Topic established a three-tier hierarchy to\nmaximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure\npurposes. Inputs refer broadly to the information that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Examples of risks\ninclude those inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs are\nclassified as observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own\nassumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical investments\nLevel 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)\nLevel 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)\n11\nThe following summarizes the levels of fair value measurements of the Company’s investments:\nAs of July 31, 2024\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 15,248 $ - $ - $ 15,248\nEquity securities 21,724 - - 21,724\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities 33,928 - - 33,928\n$ 70,900 $ - $ - $ 70,900\nAs of April 30, 2024\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 4,136 $ - $ - $ 4,136\nEquity securities 16,344 - - 16,344\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities 47,361 250 - 47,611\n$ 67,841 $ 250 $ - $ 68,091\nThe Company had no other financial instruments such as futures, forwards and swap contracts. For the periods ended July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, there were no\nLevel 3 investments. The Company does not have any liabilities that are subject to fair value measurement.\nAdvertising expenses:\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company computes its income tax provision in accordance with the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are\ndetermined based on the differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular assets and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect for the years in\nwhich the differences are expected to reverse. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17, Income taxes (Topic 740) and classifies all deferred taxes as long-\nterm liabilities on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nThe Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC establishes for all entities, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax\nreturns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. As of July 31, 2024, management has reviewed\nthe tax positions for the years still subject to tax audit under the statute of limitations, evaluated the implications, and determined that there is no material impact to the\nCompany's financial statements.\nEarnings per share:\nEarnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. Any shares\nthat are reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they are outstanding. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive common\nshares from outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nFor purposes of the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash held at banks and short term liquid investments with an\noriginal maturity of less than three months to be cash and cash equivalents. As of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, cash equivalents included $15,248,000 and $4,136,000,\nrespectively, for amounts invested in money market mutual funds that invest in short-term U.S. government securities.\n12\nNote 2 - Investments:\nInvestments held by the Company and its subsidiaries are classified as equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities in accordance with FASB's ASC\n321, Investments - Equity Securities and with FASB's ASC 320, Investments - Debt Securities. All of the Company's securities were readily marketable or had a maturity\nof twelve months or less and are classified as current assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nEquity Securities:\nEquity securities on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, consist of ETFs held for dividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity\nindexes.\nAs of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF (SDY), First\nTrust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF\n(DVY) and other Exchange Traded Funds was a combined total $16,093,000 and $11,663,000, respectively, and the fair value was $21,724,000 and $16,344,000,\nrespectively.\nProceeds from sales of equity securities during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, were $90,000 and $516,000, respectively.\nThe carrying value and fair value of equity securities at July 31, 2024 were as follows:\nGross Unrealized Gross Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nETFs - equities $ 16,093 $ 5,801 $ (170) $ 21,724\nThe carrying value and fair value of equity securities at April 30, 2024 were as follows:\nGross Unrealized Gross Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nETFs - equities $ 11,663 $ 4,685 $ (4) $ 16,344\nGovernment Debt Securities (Fixed Income Securities):\nFixed income securities consist of bank certificates of deposits and securities issued by the United States federal government.\nProceeds from maturities and sales of government debt securities classified as available-for-sale during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, were\n$16,357,000 and $15,750,000, respectively. As of July 31, 2024, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income included unrealized losses of $96,000 net of deferred tax\nbenefits of $20,000.

Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings\nperformance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the\ninvestee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of the industry in which the investee operates, or (d) factors that raise significant concerns\nabout the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern such as negative cash flows, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital and\nregulatory requirements. EAM did not record any impairment losses for its assets during the fiscal years 2025 or 2024.\nThe components of EAM’s investment management operations, provided to the Company by EAM, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) (unaudited) 2024 2023\nInvestment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds, net of waivers\nshown below $ 7,376 $ 5,428\n12b-1 fees and other fees, net of waivers $ 1,942 $ 1,579\nOther income $ 156 $ 117\nInvestment management fee waivers and reimbursements $ 47 $ 48\n12b-1 fee waivers $ 23 $ 25\nValue Line’s non-voting revenues interest $ 3,680 $ 2,616\nEAM's net income (1) $ 1,122 $ 482\n(1) Represents EAM's net income, after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the\nCompany in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nJuly 31, April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2024\n(unaudited)\nEAM's total assets $ 63,126 $ 63,076\nEAM's total liabilities (1) (6,182) (5,881)\nEAM's total equity $ 56,944 $ 57,195\n(1) At July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, EAM's total liabilities included a payable to VLI for its accrued non-voting revenues interest and non-voting profits interest of\n$4,215,000 and $3,865,000, respectively.\n14\nNote 3 - Variable Interest Entity\nThe Company holds a non-voting revenues interest and a 50% non-voting profits interest in EAM, the adviser to the Value Line asset management and mutual fund\ndistribution businesses. EAM is considered to be a VIE in relation to the Company. The Company makes its determination for consolidation of EAM as a VIE based on\na qualitative assessment of the purpose and design of EAM, the terms and characteristics of the variable interests in EAM, and the risks EAM is designed to originate\nand pass through to holders of variable interests. Other than EAM, the Company does not have an interest in any other VIEs.\nThe Company has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest in EAM because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EAM that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance. Value Line does not hold any voting stock of EAM and it does not have any involvement in the day-to-day activities or\noperations of EAM. Although the EAM Trust Agreement provides Value Line with certain consent rights and contains certain restrictive covenants related to the\nactivities of EAM, these are considered to be protective rights and therefore Value Line does not maintain control over EAM.\nIn addition, although EAM is expected to be profitable, there is a risk that it could operate at a loss. While all of the profit interest shareholders in EAM are subject to\nvariability based on EAM’s operations risk, Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest in EAM is a preferred interest in the revenues of EAM, rather than a profits\ninterest in EAM, and Value Line accordingly believes it is subject to proportionately less risk than other holders of the profits interests.\nThe Company has not provided any explicit or implicit financial or other support to EAM other than what was contractually agreed to in the EAM Trust\nAgreement. Value Line has no obligation to fund EAM in the future and, as a result, has no exposure to loss beyond its initial investment and any undistributed\nrevenues and profits interests retained in EAM. The following table presents the total assets of EAM, the maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with EAM, as\nwell as the value of the assets and liabilities the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets for its interest in EAM.\nValue Line\nInvestment in EAM Maximum Exposure\n($ in thousands) VIE Assets Trust (1) Liabilities to Loss\nAs of July 31, 2024 (unaudited) $ 63,126 $ 60,371 $ - $ 60,371\nAs of April 30, 2024 $ 63,076 $ 60,134 $ - $ 60,134\n(1) Reported within Long-Term Assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\n15\nNote 4 - Supplementary Cash Flows Information:\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows that\nsum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows.\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 15,628 $ 9,551\nRestricted cash 305 305\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated\nCondensed Statement of Cash Flows $ 15,933 $ 9,856\nIncome Tax Payments:\nThe Company made income tax payments as follows:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nState and local income tax payments $ 91 $ 164\nFederal income tax payments $ - $ -\nNote 5 - Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan:\nSubstantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are members of the Value Line, Inc. Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the \"Plan\"). In general, this is a\nqualified, contributory plan which provides for a discretionary annual Company contribution. For the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the estimated\nprofit sharing plan contributions, which are included as expenses in salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income, were $96,000\nand $96,000 in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively.\nNote 6 - Comprehensive Income:\nThe FASB's ASC Comprehensive Income topic requires the reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from operations. Comprehensive income is a\nmore inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that otherwise would not be recognized in the calculation of net\nincome.\nAs of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 the Company held fixed income securities consisting of bank certificates of deposits and securities issued by the United States\nfederal government that are classified as securities available-for-sale on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The change in valuation of fixed income\nsecurities, net of deferred income taxes, has been recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Company's Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nThe components of comprehensive income included in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income and Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the three months\nended July 31, 2024 are as follows:\nAmount Before Tax (Expense) / Amount Net of\n($ in thousands) Tax Benefit Tax\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ 224 $ (47) $ 177\n$ 224 $ (47) $ 177\nThe components of comprehensive income included in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income and Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the three months\nended July 31, 2023 are as follows:\nAmount Before Tax (Expense) / Amount Net of\n($ in thousands) Tax Benefit Tax\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ (270) $ 58 $ (212)\n$ (270) $ 58 $ (212)\n16\nNote 7 - Related Party Transactions:\nInvestment Management (overview):\nThe Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the\nCompany does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and\nreceives non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below.\nTotal assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at July 31, 2024, were $4.60 billion, 32.6% above total assets of $3.47 billion in the Value Line\nFunds managed and/or distributed by EAM at July 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive quarterly distributions in a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues\n(excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in\ncertain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s\nprofits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement. Value Line’s percent share of EAM’s revenues is calculated each fiscal quarter.\nEAM Trust - VLI's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests:\nThe Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from 41% to\n55% of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business. EAM currently has no separately managed account clients.\nThe Company recorded income from its non-voting revenues interest and its non-voting profits interests in EAM as follows:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nNon-voting revenues interest in EAM $ 3,680 $ 2,616\nNon-voting profits interest in EAM 561 241\n$ 4,241 $ 2,857\nAt July 31, 2024, the Company's investment in EAM includes a receivable of $4,215,000 representing the quarterly distribution of the non-voting revenues share and\nnon-voting profits share. That amount was subsequently paid to the Company.\nTransactions with Parent:\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the Company was reimbursed $60,000 and $63,000, respectively, for payments it made on behalf of and for\nservices the Company provided to the Parent Company, Arnold Bernhard and Co., Inc. (\"Parent\"). There were no receivables from the Parent on the Consolidated\nCondensed Balance Sheets at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024.\nThe Company is a party to a tax-sharing arrangement with the Parent which allocates the tax liabilities of the two Companies between them. The Company made no\nfederal tax payments to the Parent during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023.\nFrom time to time, the Parent has purchased additional shares of common stock of the Company in the market when and as the Parent has determined it to be\nappropriate. The Parent may make additional purchases of common stock of the Company from time to time in the future. As of July 31, 2024, the Parent owned 91.67% of\nthe outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.\n17\nNote 8 - Federal, State and Local Income Taxes:\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC, the Company's provision for income taxes includes the following:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nCurrent tax expense:\nFederal $ 1,283 $ 1,209\nState and local 312 251\nCurrent tax expense 1,595 1,460\nDeferred tax expense (benefit):\nFederal 304 40\nState and local 11 -\nDeferred tax expense (benefit): 315 40\nIncome tax provision $ 1,910 $ 1,500\nOn December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), was enacted. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal income tax rate (\"Federal\nTax Rate\") from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company computes Federal income tax expense using the Federal Tax Rate of 21% in fiscal year\n2019 and each year thereafter.\nThe overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 were 24.50% and 23.87%,\nrespectively. The higher effective tax rate during three months ended July 31, 2024 as compared to July 31, 2023, is primarily a result of a increase in the state and local\nincome tax rate to 3.69% from 3.10% due to changes in state and local income tax allocations. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a\nnumber of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to pre-\nincome tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and rulings\nand settlements with tax authorities.\n18\nDeferred income taxes, a liability, are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and liabilities.\nThe tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability are as follows:\nJuly 31, April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2024\nFederal tax liability (benefit):\nDeferred gain on deconsolidation of EAM $ 10,669 $ 10,669\nDeferred non-cash post-employment compensation (372) (372)\nDepreciation and amortization 67 73\nUnrealized gain/(loss) on securities held for sale 1,162 916\nRight of Use Asset (138) (128)\nDeferred charges (54) (138)\nOther (578) (424)\nTotal federal tax liability 10,756 10,596\nState and local tax liabilities (benefits):\nDeferred gain on deconsolidation of EAM 2,385 2,073\nDeferred non-cash post-employment compensation (83) (72)\nDepreciation and amortization 15 13\nUnrealized gain/(loss) on securities held for sale 259 178\nOther (193) 105\nTotal state and local tax liabilities 2,383 2,297\nDeferred tax liability, long-term $ 13,139 $ 12,893\nAt the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective income tax rate to apply for the full fiscal year. The Company uses the effective income\ntax rate determined to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and reflects the tax effect of any tax law changes and certain other discrete events in the period in\nwhich they occur.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income as a result of\nthe following:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n2024 2023\nU.S. statutory federal tax rate 21.00% 21.00%\nIncrease (decrease) in tax rate from:\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 3.69% 3.10%\nEffect of dividends received deductions (0.19)% (0.24)%\nOther, net - 0.01%\nEffective income tax rate 24.50% 23.87%\nThe Company believes that, as of July 31, 2024, there were no material uncertain tax positions that would require disclosure under GAAP.\n19\nThe Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the Parent. The Company has a tax sharing agreement which requires it to make tax payments\nto the Parent equal to the Company's liability/(benefit) as if it filed a separate return. Beginning with the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, the Company files combined\nincome tax returns with the Parent on a unitary basis in certain states.\nThe Company’s federal income tax returns (included in the Parent’s consolidated returns) and state and city tax returns for fiscal years ended 2021 through 2023, are\nsubject to examination by the tax authorities, generally for three years after they are filed with the tax authorities.\nNote 9 - Property and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or in\nthe case of leasehold improvements, over the remaining terms of the leases. For income tax purposes, depreciation of furniture and equipment is computed using\naccelerated methods and buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over prescribed extended tax lives. Property and equipment, net, on the Consolidated\nCondensed Balance Sheets was comprised of the following:\nJuly 31, April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2024\nBuilding and leasehold improvements $ 652 $ 652\nOperating lease - right-of-use asset 3,833 4,090\nFurniture and equipment 2,278 2,274\n6,763 7,016\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (2,599) (2,576)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 4,164 $ 4,440\n20\nNote 10 - Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use:\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Position 98-1 (SOP 98-1), \"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use\".\nSOP 98-1 requires companies to capitalize as long-lived assets many of the costs associated with developing or purchasing software for internal use and amortize those\ncosts over the software's estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner. Such costs, when incurred, are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life\nof the asset, normally 3 to 5 years. Total amortization expenses during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, were $14,000 and $21,000, respectively.\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the Company did not incur and did not capitalize expenditures related to third party programmers' costs\nnor internal costs to develop software for internal use.\nNote 11 - Treasury Stock and Repurchase Program:\nDuring October 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a renewal of a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock up to an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in\nnegotiated transactions off the market, in block purchases or otherwise. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s\ndiscretion and has no set price limit and no expiration date. There is a remainder of $1,033,000 before the authorized limit is reached.\nTreasury stock, at cost, consists of the following:\nAggregate\nPurchase Price\nAverage Cost Remaining Under\n(in thousands except for shares and cost per share) Shares Cost Assigned per Share the Program\nBalance as of April 30, 2024 577,517 $ 15,194 $ 26.31 $ 1,211\nPurchases effected in open market during the months ended:\nMay 31, 2024 1,644 $ 67 40.15 1,145\nJune 30, 2024 2,000 $ 80 40.00 1,065\nJuly 31, 2024 765 $ 32 41.83 1,033\nBalance as of July 31, 2024 581,926 $ 15,373 $ 26.42 $ 1,033\n21\nNote 12 - Lease Commitments:\nOn November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc., received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement between Value\nLine, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated (“ABM” or the “Sublandlord”) commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM\n24,726 square feet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016\nand ending on November 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25%\nscheduled for each subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor\nand pass-through of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit\nin the amount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became\nthe Company’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to\nthe Premises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first\nsix months of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied\nagainst the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC leased\n24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”) beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on April\n30, 2024 (“Lease”). Base rent under the Lease was $237,218 per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which has been fully\nrefunded. VLDC distributed Value Line’s print publications. The Company has outsourced to a U.S. facility the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognizes in the\nstatements of financial position a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to\nmake lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognizes interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-\nuse asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. The firm adopted this ASU in May 2019\nunder a modified retrospective approach.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the Effective Date as permitted by the amendments in ASU 2018-11, which\nprovides an alternative modified retrospective transition method. As a result, the Company was not required to adjust its comparative period financial information for\neffects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e. May 1, 2019). The Company has elected to employ the\ntransitionary relief offered by the FASB and, therefore, has not reassessed (1) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, (2) lease classification for existing or\nexpired leases or (3) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized.\nThe Company leases office space in New York, NY. The Company has evaluated that lease and determined that it is an operating lease under the definitions of the\nguidance of ASU 2016-02.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the net present value of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at\nor before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is\nsubsequently measured throughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the net present value of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid\n(accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized balance of lease incentives received.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset in the amount of $9,575,000, which represents the lease liability of $10,340,000 adjusted for previously\nrecorded unamortized lease incentives in the amount of $765,000. The right-of-use asset will be amortized over the remaining lease term in the amount equal to the\ndifference between the calculated straight-line expense of the total lease payments less the monthly interest calculated on the remaining lease liability. As of July 31,\n2024, the Company had a long-term lease asset of $3,833,000, solely related to our NYC headquarters, located at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY, recorded in property\nand equipment in its consolidated balance sheets. The VLDC lease at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ ended on April 30, 2024.\n22\nThe Company recognizes lease expense, calculated as the remaining cost of the lease allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense is\npresented as part of continuing operations in the consolidated condensed statements of income. The Company recognized $319,000 and $375,000 in lease expenses in\nboth fiscal years 2025 and 2024 during the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, respectively.\nFor the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company paid $354,000 in rent relating to the leases. As a payment arising from an operating lease, the $354,000 is\nclassified within operating activities in the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.\nThe Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit interest rate, and therefore the Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, as of the\ncommencement date, to determine the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The IBR is defined under ASC 842 as the rate of interest that the Company would\nhave to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The following table\nreconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of July\n31, 2024:\nFiscal years ended April 30, ($ in thousands)\n2025* $ 1,075\n2026 1,461\n2027 1,493\n2028 882\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 4,911\nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments & the present value of future lease payments 419\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 4,492\n* Excludes the three months ended July 31, 2024\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for our operating leases:\nAs of July 31, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 3.33\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.25%\n23\nNote 13 - Restricted Cash and Deposits:\nRestricted Money Market Investment in the noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at July 31, 2024, includes $305,000, which represents cash\ninvested in a bank money market fund securing a letter of credit (\"LOC\") in the amount of $305,000 issued to the sublandlord as a security deposit for the Company's\nNew York City leased corporate office facility. According to the sublease agreement the LOC and restricted cash were reduced from $469,000 to $305,000 in the third\nquarter of fiscal year 2022.\nNote 14 - Concentration:\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, 29.2% of total publishing revenues of $6,287,000 were derived from a single customer.\nNote 15 - Concentration of Credit Risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As of July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023, the Company had $3,918,000 and $2,620,000, respectively,\nin excess of the FDIC insured limit. Management has concluded the excess does not represent a material risk, based on the creditworthiness of the counter parties.\nThe Company maintains a deposit account of $305,000 at Flagstar Bank as security for a letter of credit in a similar amount (See Note 13).\n24\nNote 16 - Business Segments:\nThe Company allocates resources and assesses financial performance on a consolidated basis. It does so because significant costs are shared in common by all\nproducts, and as a result, it does not have discrete financial information available for separate business components to assess performance and make resource allocation\ndecisions for more than one segment. Therefore, the investment periodicals and related publications (such as digital equivalents), along with supplying the embedded\nProprietary information and intellectual property rights, are treated as one segment, Publishing.\nAll required segment financial information can be found directly in the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the\nsame as those described in Note 1.\nValue Line’s customers are almost entirely located within the United States. It receives approximately 2% of its revenues from external customers located outside of the\nUnited States.\nAs described in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, the Company deconsolidated its investment management business in December\n2010 and therefore no longer reports the investment management operation as a separate business unit. Although VLI continues to receive significant cash flows from\nthese operations through its non-controlling investment in EAM, it no longer considers this to be a reportable business segment because it does not satisfy one of the\nrequired characteristics of an operating segment pursuant to ASC 280-10-50-1. Specifically, VLI’s Chief Executive Officer does not regularly review EAM’s operating\nresults to make decisions about resources to be allocated to EAM.\n25\nItem 2.

Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line®, the Value Line logo®, The Value Line Investment\nSurvey®, Smart Research, Smarter Investing™ and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research®. The name \"Value Line\" as used to describe the Company, its\nproducts, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust (“EAM”) was established to provide the investment\nmanagement services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line®\nMutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues\nand non-voting profits interests.\nThe Company’s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals.\nIndividuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal\nlibraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company’s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and\nhistorical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.\nPayments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as\nunearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription.\nAccordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned\nrevenue within current and long-term liabilities.\nThe investment periodicals and related publications (retail and institutional) and Value Line copyrights and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary\ninformation consolidate into one segment called Publishing. The Publishing segment constitutes the Company’s only reportable business segment.\nAsset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses\nPursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has\nno voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business.\n27\nThe business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20% of the voting interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees.\nThe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution\nrevenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in certain limited\ncircumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s profits payable\neach fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.\nBusiness Environment\nThe U.S. economy, after showing signs of slowing down during the first three months of calendar 2024, reaccelerated in the second quarter. The nation’s gross\ndomestic product expanded by an estimated 3.0% in the June quarter, more than double the 1.4% gain recorded in the March period. The advance was fueled by a 2.9%\nincrease in personal consumption expenditures, which was nearly twice the pace logged in the initial quarter. The consumer sector, which accounts for two-thirds of the\nnation’s output, has proven resilient amid higher inflation and elevated lending rates the last few years. But these gains may have come at a price, as consumer credit\ncard debt rose to a record $1.14 trillion in the second stanza and loan delinquencies are on the rise.\nThe economic advance comes as the Federal Reserve appears poised to start winding down its most restrictive monetary policy course in four decades in an\neffort to rein in inflation. The Fed looks close to achieving its goal, as the pace of both consumer and producer (wholesale) price growth eased further over the summer\nmonths and moved closer to the central bank’s target growth rate of 2%. This has likely given the lead bank the confidence to begin reducing the federal funds rate after\nholding it steady, in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, for eight-consecutive Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings through July of this year.\nThe central bank also is keeping a close eye on the labor market, which is the other part of its dual mandate. Initial weekly unemployment claims in July and\nAugust were running at a level indicative of a tight labor market, but other metrics suggest that overall labor conditions are softening. These included a series of sharp\ndownward revision to earlier job creation totals, a steady upward move in the nation’s unemployment rate ( from 3.7% in January to 4.3% at the end of July), and the\nLabor Department’s report stating that monthly payroll figures overstated job growth by roughly 818,000 in the 12 months that ended in March, 2024. Our sense is that\nthe state of the job market going forward will play a big role in deciding just how aggressively the Federal Reserve will reduce the benchmark short-term interest rate\nover the remaining months of calendar 2024.\nIn conclusion, the Federal Reserve appears to be inching closer to achieving its goal of taming inflation, which jumped to a 40-year high in June, 2022, without\nleading to a sharp deterioration in the U.S. labor market and pushing the economy into recession. This has provided a supportive backdrop for Corporate America and\nthe U.S. stock market. In all, the business environment has held up well, with profit growth for S&P 500 companies averaging nearly 11% in the second quarter. This\nrepresented the highest year-over-year earnings growth for S&P 500 companies since the final quarter of 2021, and was likely needed to justify the Index’s high price-to-\nearnings multiple, which at the end of the second calendar quarter was above both its five- and 10-year averages.\n28\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended July 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table illustrates the Company’s key components of revenues and expenses.\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands, except earnings per share) 2024 2023 Change\nIncome from operations $ 1,847 $ 2,747 -32.8%\nNon-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests from EAM Trust 4,241 2,857 48.4%\nIncome from operations plus non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests from\nEAM Trust $ 6,088 $ 5,604 8.6%\nOperating expenses $ 7,037 $ 6,996 0.6%\nInvestment gains / (losses) $ 1,709 $ 755 126.4%\nIncome before income taxes $ 7,797 $ 6,359 22.6%\nNet income $ 5,887 $ 4,859 21.2%\nEarnings per share $ 0.62 $ 0.52 19.2%\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company’s net income of $5,887,000, or $0.62 per share, was 21.2% above net income of $4,859,000, or $0.52\nper share, for the three months ended July 31, 2023. For the three months ended July 31, 2024, operating expenses increased slightly above those during the three\nmonths ended July 31, 2023.\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, there were 9,419,938 average common shares outstanding as compared to 9,432,573 average common shares\noutstanding during the three months ended July 31, 2023.\nTotal operating revenues\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nInvestment periodicals and related publications:\nPrint $ 2,233 $ 2,382 -6.3%\nDigital 4,054 4,075 -0.5%\nTotal investment periodicals and related publications 6,287 6,457 -2.6%\nCopyright fees 2,597 3,286 -21.0%\nTotal publishing revenues $ 8,884 $ 9,743 -8.8%\nWithin investment periodicals and related publications, subscription sales orders are derived from print and digital products.

A certain amount of variation is to be expected\ndue to the volume of new orders and timing of long-term renewal contracts, direct mail campaigns and large Institutional Sales orders.\nInvestment periodicals and related publications revenues\nInvestment periodicals and related publications revenues of $6,287,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the three months ended July 31, 2024 were 2.6% below\npublications revenues of $6,457,000 in the prior fiscal year. The Company continued actions to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels, primarily\ndirect mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their own portfolios, particularly in volatile markets, total product line\ncirculation at July 31, 2024, was 2.6% below total product line circulation at July 31, 2023.\nCirculation also reflected management’s decision to reduce marketing efforts temporarily while the challenging stock market environment persisted during the\nfiscal year ended April 30, 2024. Total print circulation at July 31, 2024 was 2.2% below the total print circulation at July 31, 2023. During the three months ended July 31,\n2024, print publication revenues of $2,233,000 decreased 6.3%, below print publication revenues of $2,382,000 during the corresponding period of 2024 because we\ndeferred advertising in light of negative sentiment among prospective individual customers in a challenging market environment. Total digital circulation at July 31, 2024\nwas 3.1% below total digital circulation at July 31, 2023. During the three months ended July 31, 2024, digital revenues of $4,054,000 were slightly lower when compared\nto the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing shift from our print services to digital counterparts. Sales of our\nhigher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price “starter” products.\nValue Line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks, and other securities, who pay mostly on annual or multi-year subscription plans, for\nbasic services or as much as $100,000 or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research, not obtainable elsewhere.\n30\nThe Value Line Proprietary Ranks (the “Ranking System”), a component of the Company’s flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey, are also utilized\nin the Company’s copyright business. The Ranking System is made available to EAM for specific uses without charge. During the twelve month period ended July 31,\n2024, the combined Ranking System “Rank 1 & 2” stocks’ increase of 18.4% compared favorably to the Russell 2000 Index’s increase of 12.5% during the comparable\nperiod.\nCopyright fees\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, copyright fees of $2,597,000 were 21.0% below those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year. These fees\ndepend on the assets under management in financial products with contractual arrangements to use the Ranks and other Value Line proprietary information.\nInvestment management fees and services – (unconsolidated)\nThe Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly,\nthe Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business\nand will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.\nTotal assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at July 31, 2024, were $4.60 billion, which is $1.13 billion, or 32.6%, above total assets\nof $3.47 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at July 31, 2023.\nValue Line Mutual Funds\nAs of July 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 Change\nEquity and hybrid funds $ 4,566 $ 3,432 33.0%\nFixed income funds 37 39 -5.1%\nTotal EAM managed net assets $ 4,603 $ 3,471 32.6%\nEAM Trust - Results of operations before distribution to interest holders\nThe gross fees and net income of EAM’s investment management operations during the three months ended July 31, 2024, before interest holder distributions,\nincluded total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of $7,376,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of $1,942,000 and other net gains of $156,000. For\nthe same period, total investment management fee waivers were $47,000 and 12b-1 fee waivers were $23,000. During the three months ended July 31, 2024, EAM's net\nincome was $1,122,000 after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest of $3,680,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the\nCompany in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nThe gross fees and net income of EAM’s investment management operations during the three months ended July 31, 2023, before interest holder distributions,\nincluded total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of $5,428,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of $1,579,000 and other net gains of $117,000. For\nthe same period, total investment management fee waivers were $48,000 and 12b-1 fee waivers were $25,000. During the three months ended July 31, 2023, EAM's net\nincome was $482,000 after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest of $2,616,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the\nCompany in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nAs of July 31, 2024, one of the Value Line Funds has 12b-1 fees waivers in place, and five funds have partial investment management fee waivers in place.\nAlthough, under the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company does not receive or share in the revenues from 12b-1 distribution fees, the Company could\nbenefit from the fee waivers to the extent that the resulting reduction of expense ratios and enhancement of the performance of the Value Line Funds attracts new assets.\n31\nThe Value Line equity and hybrid funds’ assets represent 99.2% and fixed income fund assets represent 0.8%, respectively, of total fund assets under\nmanagement (“AUM”) as of July 31, 2024. At July 31, 2024, equity and hybrid AUM increased by 33.0% and fixed income AUM decreased by 5.1% as compared to last\nyear at July 31, 2023.\nEAM - The Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests\nThe Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from\n41% to 55% of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business, and 50% of EAM’s net profits, not less than 90% of\nwhich is distributed in cash every fiscal quarter.\nThe Company recorded income from its non-voting revenues interest and its non-voting profits interest in EAM as follows:\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nNon-voting revenues interest $ 3,680 $ 2,616 40.7%\nNon-voting profits interest 561 241 132.8%\n$ 4,241 $ 2,857 48.4%\nOperating expenses\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nAdvertising and promotion $ 860 $ 772 11.4%\nSalaries and employee benefits 3,543 3,740 -5.3%\nProduction and distribution 1,489 1,395 6.7%\nOffice and administration 1,145 1,089 5.1%\nTotal expenses $ 7,037 $ 6,996 0.6%\nExpenses within the Company are categorized into advertising and promotion, salaries and employee benefits, production and distribution, office and\nadministration. Operating expenses of $7,037,000 during the three months ended July 31, 2024, were slightly above those during the three months ended July 31, 2023.\nAdvertising and promotion\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, advertising and promotion expenses of $860,000 increased 11.4% as compared to the prior fiscal year. During the\nthree months ended July 31, 2024, increases were primarily due to increases in third-party telemarketing & sales consulting.\nSalaries and employee benefits\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, salaries and employee benefits of $3,543,000 decreased 5.3% below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreases\nin salaries and employee benefits resulting from reduced employee headcount during fiscal years 2024 and 2025.\n32\nProduction and distribution\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, production and distribution expenses of $1,489,000 increased 6.7% above prior fiscal year primarily due to\nincreases in third-party distribution and mailing expenses that resulted from outsourcing our internal distribution operations during the latter part of fiscal year 2024 and\nadditional costs in third-party fulfillment software expenses. This increase was partially offset by decreases in production expenses to support the Company’s website\nand maintenance of the Company’s publishing application software and operating systems.\nOffice and administration\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, office and administrative expenses of $1,145,000 increased 5.1% above the prior fiscal year, due to an increases\nthat resulted from a software upgrade project to replace outdated software and costs of outsourced product billing functions that were previously handled internally by\nemployees.\nConcentration\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, 29.2% of total publishing revenues of $6,287,000 were derived from a single customer.\nInvestment gains / (losses)\nThree Months Ended July 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change\nDividend income $ 147 $ 145 1.4%\nInterest income 545 389 40.1%\nInvestment gains / (losses) recognized on sale of equity securities during\nthe period - 11 -\nUnrealized gains / (losses) recognized on equity securities held at the end\nof the period 950 210 352.4%\nOther 67 - -\nTotal investment gains / (losses) $ 1,709 $ 755 126.4%\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company’s total investment gains of $1,709,000 increased 126.4% above prior fiscal year, primarily derived\nfrom unrealized gains on equity securities and increases in the interest income. Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the three months ended July 31, 2024\nand July 31, 2023 were $90,000 and $516,000, respectively.\n33\nEffective income tax rate\nThe overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the three months ended July 31, 2024 and July 31, 2023 were 24.50% and\n23.87%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate during three months ended July 31, 2024 as compared to July 31, 2023, is primarily a result of an increase in the state\nand local income taxes from 3.10% to 3.69% due to changes in state and local income tax allocations. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate fluctuates due\nto a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax consequences to\npre-tax income, the Company's geographic profit mix among tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing tax laws and\nrulings and settlements with tax authorities.\nLease Commitments\nOn November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc. received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement\nbetween Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square\nfeet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on\nNovember 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for\neach subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-\nthrough of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the\namount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the\nCompany’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the\nPremises. The sublease terms provide for a significant decrease (23% initially) in the Company’s annual rental expenditure taking into account free rent for the first six\nmonths of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which accompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied\nagainst the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent payments until November 2017.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC\nleased 24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”) beginning on May 1, 2016 and ending on\nApril 30, 2024 (“Lease”). Base rent under the Lease was $237,218 per annum. The Company provided a security deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which has been\nfully refunded. VLDC distributed Value Line’s print publications. The Company has outsourced to a U.S. facility the functions formerly performed at the Warehouse.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $50,381,000 as of July 31, 2024 and $48,770,000 as of April 30, 2024. These\namounts include short-term unearned revenue of $15,991,000 and $15,764,000 reflected in total current liabilities at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively. Cash and\nshort-term securities were $71,280,000 and $68,345,000 as of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents include $15,248,000 and $4,136,000 at July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, respectively, invested primarily in commercial\nbanks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities.\nCash from operating activities\nThe Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $4,771,000 during the three months ended July 31, 2024, compared to cash inflows of $5,058,000\nduring the three months ended July 31, 2023. The change in cash inflows was a result of an increase in unrealized gains on equity securities and a decrease in accounts\nreceivable from customers, offset by a smaller decline of unearned revenue from the same period last year.\n34\nCash from investing activities\nThe Company had cash inflows from investing activities of $9,473,000 during the three months ended July 31, 2024, compared to cash outflows from investing\nactivities of $267,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023, respectively. The significant cash inflows in investing activities for the three months ended July 31, 2024\nwas a result of the company’s conscious decisions to invest the proceeds from maturities of fixed income short-term securities in the company’s short-term U.S.\nGovernment money market funds at higher yields than U.S Treasury Bills.\nCash from financing activities\nDuring the three months ended July 31, 2024, the Company’s cash outflows from financing activities were $3,006,000, compared to cash outflows from financing\nactivities of $2,830,000 for the three months ended July 31, 2023. Quarterly dividend payments of $0.30 per share during fiscal year 2025 aggregated $2,827,000. Quarterly\nregular dividend payments of $0.28 per share during fiscal year 2024 aggregated $2,642,000.\nAt July 31, 2024 there were 9,418,074 common shares outstanding as compared to 9,430,529 common shares outstanding at July 31, 2023. The Company expects\nfinancing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future.\nDebt and Liquid Assets\nManagement believes that the Company’s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with future cash flows from operations and from\nthe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve\nmonths and beyond. Management does not anticipate making any borrowings during the next twelve months. As of July 31, 2024, retained earnings and liquid assets\nwere $107,311,000 and $71,280,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2024, retained earnings and liquid assets were $104,249,000 and $68,345,000, respectively. There are no\noff-balance-sheet arrangements, so none affect the interpretations of reported assets, liquidity, and debt.\nSeasonality\nOur publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally\nseasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which\nrequires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied\non a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We\nare evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for\nadditional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax\nrate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects,\ntax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature\nand jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual\njurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n35\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States\n(U.S. “GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the\nCompany evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company’s critical accounting policy relates to the valuation of EAM. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the\nthree months ended July 31, 2024. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year\nended April 30, 2024.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are a party to a lease contract which will result in cash payments to a lessor in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next four fiscal years and thereafter are (in thousands): $1,075 in 2025; $1,461 in 2026; $1,493 in 2027\nand $882 in 2028 totaling $4,911.\n36\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nThe Company’s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company’s\nmarket risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company’s\ninvestment activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that\nlosses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company’s management invests primarily in short-term obligations\nmaturing within one year.\nThe fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing\ninterest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be\naffected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions.\nFixed income securities consist of bank certificates of deposits and securities issued by the United States federal government. As of July 31, 2024 the aggregate\ncost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $34,042,000 and $33,928,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2024 the aggregate cost and\nfair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $47,931,000 and $47,611,000, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It is\nassumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest\nrates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments\ndue to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.\nFixed Income Securities\nEstimated Fair Value after\nHypothetical Change in Interest Rates\n(in thousands)\n(bp = basis points)\n1 year 1 year 1 year 1 year\nFair 50 bp 50 bp 100 bp 100 bp\nValue decrease decrease decrease decrease\nAs of July 31, 2024\nInvestments in securities with fixed maturities $ 33,928 $ 33,317 $ 33,999 $ 32,983 $ 34,347\nAs of April 30, 2024\nInvestments in securities with fixed maturities $ 47,611 $ 46,554 $ 46,935 $ 46,363 $ 47,126\nManagement regularly monitors the maturity structure of the Company’s investments in debt securities in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated\nwith changes in interest rates.\n37\nEquity Price Risk\nThe carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to\nfluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the\nmarket price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and\ngeneral market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.\nThe Company’s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for\ndividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes. In order to maintain liquidity in these securities, the Company’s policy has been to\ninvest in and hold in its portfolio, no more than 5% of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue.\nAs of July 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF\n(SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY), Vanguard\nGrowth ETF (VUG) and other Exchange Traded Funds was a combined total of $16,093,000 and $11,663,000, respectively, and the fair value was $21,724,000 and\n$16,344,000, respectively.\nEstimated Fair Hypothetical\nEquity Securities Value after Percentage\nIncrease\nHypothetical Hypothetical (Decrease) in\nShareholders’\n($ in thousands) Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Equity\nEquity Securities and ETFs\nAs of July 31, 2024 held for dividend yield $ 21,724 30% increase $ 28,241 5.49%\n30% decrease $ 15,207 (5.49%)\nEstimated Fair Hypothetical\nEquity Securities Value after Percentage\nIncrease\nHypothetical Hypothetical (Decrease) in\nShareholders’\n($ in thousands) Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Equity\nEquity Securities and ETFs\nAs of April 30, 2024 held for dividend yield $ 16,344 30% increase $ 21,247 4.27%\n30% decrease $ 11,441 (4.27%)\n38\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nThe Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the effectiveness\nof the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as\nof the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n(b) The registrant’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that there have been no changes in the registrant’s internal control\nover financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nregistrant’s internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nPart I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2024, reflects any changes and updates (see page 22) in addition to the list of the risk\nfactors disclosed in Item 1A - Risk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024 filed with the SEC on July 26, 2024. Any new\nrisk factors reflect management's continuing analysis of developments in the Company's business environment, rather than any specific event or particular issue.\n39\nItem 2.

(\"Value Line\" or \"VLI\", and collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is incorporated in the State of New York. The name \"Value Line\" as used to\ndescribe the Company, its products, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. The Company's core business is producing investment periodicals\nand their underlying research and making available certain Value Line copyrights, Value Line trademarks and Value Line Proprietary Ranks and other proprietary\ninformation, to third parties under written agreements for use in third-party managed and marketed investment products and for other purposes. The Company\nmaintains a significant investment in Eulav Asset Management LLC (\"EAM\") from which it receives a non-voting revenues interest and a non-voting profits\ninterest. Pursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust dated as of December 23, 2010 (the \"EAM Trust Agreement\"), VLI granted EAM the right to use the Value Line name\nfor all existing Value Line Funds and agreed to supply, without charge or expense, the Value Line Proprietary Ranking System information to EAM for use in managing\nthe Value Line Funds. EAM was established to provide investment management services to the Value Line Mutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\" or the \"Funds\").\nThe Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, which have been derived from the unaudited interim Consolidated Condensed\nFinancial Statements and the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, were prepared following the interim reporting requirements of the Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”). In the opinion of management, the accompanying Unaudited Interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements contain all\nadjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals except as noted below) considered necessary for a fair presentation. This report should be read in conjunction\nwith the audited financial statements and footnotes contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 filed with the SEC\non July 28, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). Results of operations covered by this report may not be indicative of the results of operations for the entire year.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation:\nThe Company follows the guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (\"FASB\") Topic 810 “Consolidation” to determine if it should consolidate its\ninvestment in a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). A VIE is a legal entity in which either (i) equity investors do not have sufficient equity investment at risk to enable the\nentity to finance its activities independently or (ii) the equity holders at risk lack the obligation to absorb losses, the right to receive residual returns or the right to make\ndecisions about the entity’s activities that most significantly affect the entity's economic performance. A holder of a variable interest in a VIE is required to consolidate\nthe entity if it is determined that it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary. The determination of a controlling financial\ninterest in a VIE is based on a qualitative assessment to identify the variable interest holder, if any, that has (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (ii) either the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could\npotentially be significant to the VIE. The accounting guidance requires the Company to perform an ongoing assessment of whether the Company is the primary\nbeneficiary of a VIE and the Company has determined it is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE (see Note 3).\nIn accordance with FASB's Topic 810, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling interest have been\nconsolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company holds a significant non-voting revenues\ninterest (excluding distribution revenues) and a significant non-voting profits interest in EULAV Asset Management, a Delaware statutory trust (“EAM” or “EAM\nTrust”). The Company relied on the guidance in FASB's ASC Topics 323 and 810 in its determination not to consolidate its investment in EAM and to account for such\ninvestment under the equity method of accounting. The Company reports the amount it earns for its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests as a separate\nline item below operating income in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income.\nRevenue Recognition:\nDepending upon the product, subscription fulfillment for Value Line periodicals and related publications is available in print or digitally, via internet access. The length\nof a subscription varies by product and offer received by the subscriber. Generally, subscriptions are offered as annual subscriptions. Subscription revenues, net of\ndiscounts, are recognized ratably on a straight line basis when the product is served to the client over the life of the subscription. Accordingly, the amount of\nsubscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of the balance sheets are shown as unearned revenue within current and long-term liabilities.\nCopyright fees are derived from providing certain Value Line trademarks and the Value Line Proprietary Ranks to third parties under written agreements for use in\nselecting securities for third party marketed products, including unit investment trusts, annuities and exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\"). The Company earns asset-based\ncopyright fees upon delivery to the customer as specified in the individual agreements. Revenue is recognized monthly and received either quarterly or in advance over\nthe term of the agreement and, because it is asset-based, will fluctuate as the market value of the underlying portfolio increases or decreases in value.\n9\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities:\nThe Company accounts for its investment in its unconsolidated entity, EAM, using the equity method of accounting in accordance with FASB’s ASC 323. The equity\nmethod is an appropriate means of recognizing increases or decreases measured by GAAP in the economic resources underlying the investments. Under the equity\nmethod, an investor recognizes its share of the earnings or losses of an investee in the periods for which they are reported by the investee in its financial statements\nrather than in the period in which an investee declares a dividend or distribution. An investor adjusts the carrying amount of an investment for its share of the earnings\nor losses recognized by the investee.\nThe Company’s “interests” in EAM, the investment adviser to and the sole member of the distributor of the Value Line Funds, consist of a \"non-voting revenues\ninterest\" and a \"non-voting profits interest\" in EAM as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement. The non-voting revenues interest entitles the Company to receive a range\nof 41% to 55% of EAM’s adjusted gross revenues, excluding EULAV Securities' distribution revenues (“Revenues Interest”). The non-voting profits interest entitles the\nCompany to receive 50% of EAM's profits, subject to certain limited adjustments as defined in the EAM Trust Agreement (“Profits Interest”). The Revenues Interest\nand at least 90% of the Profits Interest are to be distributed each quarter to all interest holders of EAM, including Value Line. The Company's Revenues Interest in EAM\nexcludes participation in the service and distribution fees of EAM's subsidiary EULAV Securities. The Company reflects its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits\ninterests in EAM as non-operating income under the equity method of accounting. Although the Company does not have control over the operating and financial\npolicies of EAM, pursuant to the EAM Trust Agreement, the Company has a contractual right to receive its share of EAM's revenues and profits.\nValuation of Securities:\nThe Company's securities classified as cash equivalents, equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities consist of shares of money market funds that\ninvest primarily in short-term U.S. Government securities, investments in equities including ETFs and fixed income securities invested primarily in short-term U.S.\nTreasury bills, and to a smaller extent bank certificates of deposit that are valued in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the\nFASB's ASC 820. The securities classified as equity securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and\nlosses are recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income per FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (\"ASU 2016-01\"). The securities\nclassified as available-for-sale fixed income securities reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets are valued at market and unrealized gains and losses, net\nof applicable taxes, are reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity. Investment gains and losses on sales of the equity securities are the difference\nbetween proceeds from sales and the fair value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Investment gains and losses on sales\nof the available-for-sale fixed income securities are the difference between proceeds from sales and the cost of the securities. Investment gains and losses on sales of all\nsecurities are recorded in earnings as of the trade date and are determined on the identified cost method.\nThe Company classifies its equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities as current assets to properly reflect its liquidity and to recognize the fact that\nit has liquid assets available-for-sale should the need arise.\nMarket valuations of securities listed on a securities exchange and ETF shares are based on the closing sales prices on the last business day of each month. The market\nvalue of the Company's fixed maturity U.S. Government debt securities is determined utilizing publicly quoted market prices. Cash equivalents consist of investments in\nmoney market funds that invest primarily in U.S. Government securities valued in accordance with rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.\nThe Fair Value Measurements Topic of FASB's ASC defines fair value as the price that the Company would receive upon selling an investment in a timely transaction to\nan independent buyer in the principal or most advantageous market for the investment. The Fair Value Measurements Topic established a three-tier hierarchy to\nmaximize the use of observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of fair value measurements for disclosure\npurposes. Inputs refer broadly to the information that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk. Examples of risks\ninclude those inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs are\nclassified as observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own\nassumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\n10\nThe three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels listed below.\nLevel 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical investments\nLevel 2 – other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)\nLevel 3 – significant unobservable inputs (including the Company’s own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)\nThe following summarizes the levels of fair value measurements of the Company’s investments:\nAs of January 31, 2024\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 4,739 $ - $ - $ 4,739\nEquity securities 15,370 - - 15,370\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities 45,899 250 - 46,149\n$ 66,008 $ 250 $ - $ 66,258\nAs of April 30, 2023\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nCash equivalents $ 7,240 $ - $ - $ 7,240\nEquity securities 14,546 - - 14,546\nAvailable-for-sale fixed income securities 39,178 750 - 39,928\n$ 60,964 $ 750 $ - $ 61,714\nThe Company had no other financial instruments such as futures, forwards and swap contracts.

Deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the\nexpected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are\ndetermined based on the differences between the book values and the tax bases of particular assets and liabilities, using tax rates currently in effect for the years in\nwhich the differences are expected to reverse. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-17, Income taxes (Topic 740) and classifies all deferred taxes as long-\nterm liabilities on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nThe Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC establishes for all entities, a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken in filing tax\nreturns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. As of January 31, 2024, management has\nreviewed the tax positions for the years still subject to tax audit under the statute of limitations, evaluated the implications, and determined that there is no material\nimpact to the Company's financial statements.\nEarnings per share:\nEarnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during each period. Any shares\nthat are reacquired during the period are weighted for the portion of the period that they are outstanding. The Company does not have any potentially dilutive common\nshares from outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted stock, or restricted stock units.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nFor purposes of the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all cash held at banks and short term liquid investments with an\noriginal maturity of less than three months to be cash and cash equivalents. As of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, cash equivalents included $4,739,000 and\n$7,240,000, respectively, for amounts invested in money market mutual funds that invest in short term U.S. government securities or savings accounts located in the\nUnited States.\n11\nNote 2 - Investments:\nInvestments held by the Company and its subsidiaries are classified as equity securities and available-for-sale fixed income securities in accordance with FASB's ASC\n321, Investments - Equity Securities and with FASB's ASC 320, Investments - Debt Securities. All of the Company's securities were readily marketable or had a maturity\nof twelve months or less and are classified as current assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nEquity Securities:\nEquity securities on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets, consist of ETFs held for dividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity\nindexes.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF (SDY),\nFirst Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY) and other\nExchange Traded Funds was a combined total $11,109,000 and $10,169,000, respectively, and the fair value was $15,370,000 and $14,546,000, respectively.\nProceeds from sales of equity securities during the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, were $1,129,000 and $1,421,000, respectively.\nThe carrying value and fair value of equity securities at January 31, 2024 were as follows:\nGross Unrealized Gross Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nETFs - equities $ 11,109 $ 4,265 $ (4) $ 15,370\nThe carrying value and fair value of equity securities at April 30, 2023 were as follows:\nGross Unrealized Gross Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Cost Gains Losses Fair Value\nETFs - equities $ 10,169 $ 4,392 $ (15) $ 14,546\n12\nGovernment Debt Securities (Fixed Income Securities):\nFixed income securities consist of certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state and local governments within the United States.\nProceeds from maturities and sales of government debt securities classified as available-for-sale during the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023,\nwere $32,113,000 and $9,907,000, respectively. As of January 31, 2024, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income included unrealized losses of $34,000 net of deferred\ntax benefits of $6,000. As of April 30, 2023, Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income included unrealized gains of $473,000, net of deferred taxes of $99,000.\nThe aggregate cost and fair value at January 31, 2024 of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were as follows:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Gross Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Historical Cost Holding Gains Holding Losses Fair Value\nMaturity\nDue within 1 year $ 41,126 $ 39 $ (4) $ 41,161\nDue 1 year through 5 years 5,058 - (70) 4,988\nTotal investment in government debt securities $ 46,184 $ 39 $ (74) $ 46,149\nThe increase in gross unrealized losses of $508,000 on fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale net of deferred income tax benefits of $106,000, was\nincluded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2024.\nThe aggregate cost and fair value at April 30, 2023 of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were as follows:\nAmortized Gross Unrealized Gross Unrealized\n($ in thousands) Historical Cost Holding Gains Holding Losses Fair Value\nMaturity\nDue within 1 year $ 34,384 $ 486 $ (5) $ 34,865\nDue within 1 year through 5 years 5,071 (8) 5,063\nTotal investment in government debt securities $ 39,455 $ 486 $ (13) $ 39,928\nThe increase in gross unrealized gains of $503,000 on fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale net of deferred income tax liability of $105,000, was included\nin Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of April 30, 2023.\nThe average yield on the Government debt securities classified as available-for-sale at January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023 was 4.56% and 2.55%, respectively.\nInvestment Gains/(Losses):\nInvestment gains/(losses) were comprised of the following:\nThree Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nDividend income $ 153 $ 190 $ 431 $ 444\nInterest income 511 194 1,387 395\nInvestment gains/(losses) recognized on sales of equity securities during the period 2 7 (1) 12\nUnrealized gains/(losses) recognized on equity securities held at the end of the period 1,343 859 (132) 425\nTotal investment gains/(losses) $ 2,009 $ 1,250 $ 1,685 $ 1,276\nTaxable realized gains/(losses) on equity securities sold during fiscal years 2024 and 2023, which are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and our\noriginal cost, were losses of $16,000 in fiscal 2024 and losses of $2,000 in fiscal 2023.\n13\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entities:\nEquity Method Investment:\nAs of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the Company's investment in EAM Trust on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets was $59,640,000 and $58,775,000,\nrespectively.\nThe value of VLI’s investment in EAM at January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023 reflects the fair value of contributed capital of $55,805,000 at inception which included\n$5,820,000 of cash and liquid securities in excess of working capital requirements contributed to EAM’s capital account by VLI, plus VLI's share of non-voting revenues\nand non-voting profits from EAM less distributions, made quarterly to VLI by EAM, during the period subsequent to its initial investment through the dates of the\nConsolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nIt is anticipated that EAM will have sufficient liquidity and earn enough profit to conduct its current and future operations so the management of EAM will not need\nadditional funding.\nThe Company monitors its Investment in EAM Trust for impairment to determine whether an event or change in circumstances has occurred that may have a significant\nadverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Impairment indicators include, but are not limited to the following: (a) a significant deterioration in the earnings\nperformance, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, (b) a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the\ninvestee, (c) a significant adverse change in the general market condition of the industry in which the investee operates, or (d) factors that raise significant concerns\nabout the investee’s ability to continue as a going concern such as negative cash flows, working capital deficiencies, or noncompliance with statutory capital and\nregulatory requirements. EAM did not record any impairment losses for its assets during the fiscal years 2024 or 2023.\nThe components of EAM’s investment management operations, provided to the Company by EAM, were as follows:\nThree Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) (unaudited) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds, net of waivers shown\nbelow $ 6,320 $ 4,809 $ 17,388 $ 14,951\n12b-1 fees and other fees, net of waivers shown below $ 1,632 $ 1,457 $ 4,811 $ 4,507\nOther income $ 192 $ 146 $ 295 $ 150\nInvestment management fee waivers and reimbursements $ 77 $ 73 $ 239 $ 104\n12b-1 fee waivers $ 24 $ 26 $ 72 $ 80\nValue Line’s non-voting revenues interest $ 3,083 $ 2,512 $ 8,420 $ 7,917\nEAM's net income (1) $ 812 $ 346 $ 1,842 $ 1,198\n(1) Represents EAM's net income, after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest, but before distributions to voting profits interest holders and to the\nCompany in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nJanuary 31, April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\n(unaudited)\nEAM's total assets $ 62,610 $ 61,389\nEAM's total liabilities (1) (5,532) (4,357)\nEAM's total equity $ 57,078 $ 57,032\n(1) At January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, EAM's total liabilities included a payable to VLI for its accrued non-voting revenues interest and non-voting profits interest\nof $3,448,000 and $2,601,000, respectively.\n14\nNote 3 - Variable Interest Entity\nThe Company holds a non-voting revenues interest and a 50% non-voting profits interest in EAM, the adviser to the Value Line asset management and mutual fund\ndistribution businesses. EAM is considered to be a VIE in relation to the Company. The Company makes its determination for consolidation of EAM as a VIE based on\na qualitative assessment of the purpose and design of EAM, the terms and characteristics of the variable interests in EAM, and the risks EAM is designed to originate\nand pass through to holders of variable interests. Other than EAM, the Company does not have an interest in any other VIEs.\nThe Company has determined that it does not have a controlling financial interest in EAM because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EAM that most\nsignificantly impact its economic performance. Value Line does not hold any voting stock of EAM and it does not have any involvement in the day-to-day activities or\noperations of EAM. Although the EAM Trust Agreement provides Value Line with certain consent rights and contains certain restrictive covenants related to the\nactivities of EAM, these are considered to be protective rights and therefore Value Line does not maintain control over EAM.\nIn addition, although EAM is expected to be profitable, there is a risk that it could operate at a loss. While all of the profit interest shareholders in EAM are subject to\nvariability based on EAM’s operations risk, Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest in EAM is a preferred interest in the revenues of EAM, rather than a profits\ninterest in EAM, and Value Line accordingly believes it is subject to proportionately less risk than other holders of the profits interests.\nThe Company has not provided any explicit or implicit financial or other support to EAM other than what was contractually agreed to in the EAM Trust\nAgreement. Value Line has no obligation to fund EAM in the future and, as a result, has no exposure to loss beyond its initial investment and any undistributed\nrevenues and profits interests retained in EAM. The following table presents the total assets of EAM, the maximum exposure to loss due to involvement with EAM, as\nwell as the value of the assets and liabilities the Company has recorded on its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets for its interest in EAM.\nValue Line\nInvestment in EAM Maximum Exposure\n($ in thousands) VIE Assets Trust (1) Liabilities to Loss\nAs of January 31, 2024 (unaudited) $ 62,610 $ 59,640 $ - $ 59,640\nAs of April 30, 2023 $ 61,389 $ 58,775 $ - $ 58,775\n(1) Reported within Long-Term Assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\n15\nNote 4 - Supplementary Cash Flows Information:\nReconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash:\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows that\nsum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Condensed Statement of Cash Flows.\nNine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nCash and cash equivalents $ 5,780 $ 11,861\nRestricted cash 305 305\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the Consolidated\nCondensed Statement of Cash Flows $ 6,085 $ 12,166\nIncome Tax Payments:\nThe Company made income tax payments as follows:\nNine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nState and local income tax payments $ 656 $ 732\nFederal income tax payments $ 4,000 $ 3,327\nNote 5 - Employees' Profit Sharing and Savings Plan:\nSubstantially all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are members of the Value Line, Inc. Profit Sharing and Savings Plan (the \"Plan\"). In general, this is a\nqualified, contributory plan which provides for a discretionary annual Company contribution. For the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the\nestimated profit sharing plan contributions, which are included as expenses in salaries and employee benefits in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income,\nwere $287,000 and $318,000 in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.\nNote 6 - Comprehensive Income:\nThe FASB's ASC Comprehensive Income topic requires the reporting of comprehensive income in addition to net income from operations. Comprehensive income is a\nmore inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial information that otherwise would not be recognized in the calculation of net\nincome.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 the Company held fixed income securities consisting of certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state, and\nlocal governments within the United States that are classified as securities available-for-sale on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets. The change in valuation\nof fixed income securities, net of deferred income taxes, has been recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in the Company's Consolidated Condensed\nBalance Sheets.\nThe components of comprehensive income included in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income and Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the nine months\nended January 31, 2024 are as follows:\nAmount Before Tax (Expense) / Amount Net of\n($ in thousands) Tax Benefit Tax\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ (508) $ 106 $ (402)\n$ (508) $ 106 $ (402)\nThe components of comprehensive income included in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income and Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the nine months\nended January 31, 2023 are as follows:\nAmount Before Tax (Expense) / Amount Net of\n($ in thousands) Tax Benefit Tax\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale fixed income securities $ 158 $ (33) $ 125\n$ 158 $ (33) $ 125\n16\nNote 7 - Related Party Transactions:\nInvestment Management (overview):\nThe Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly, the\nCompany does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business and\nreceives non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests, as discussed below.\nTotal assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at January 31, 2024, were $4.06 billion, 33.6% above total assets of $3.04 billion in the Value\nLine Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at January 31, 2023.\nThe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive quarterly distributions in a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues\n(excluding distribution revenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in\ncertain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s profits\npayable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.\nEAM Trust - VLI's non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests:\nThe Company holds non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM which entitle the Company to receive from EAM an amount ranging from 41% to\n55% of EAM's investment management fee revenues from its mutual fund and separate accounts business. EAM currently has no separately managed account\nfees. The Company recorded income from its non-voting revenues interest and its non-voting profits interests in EAM as follows:\nThree Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nNon-voting revenues interest in EAM $ 3,083 $ 2,512 $ 8,420 $ 7,917\nNon-voting profits interest in EAM 406 173 921 599\n$ 3,489 $ 2,685 $ 9,341 $ 8,516\nAt January 31, 2024, the Company's investment in EAM includes a receivable of $3,448,000 representing the quarterly distribution of the non-voting revenues share and\nnon-voting profits share. That amount was subsequently paid to the Company.\nTransactions with Parent:\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the Company was reimbursed $230,000 and $232,000, respectively, for payments it made on behalf\nof and for services the Company provided to the Parent Company, Arnold Bernhard and Co., Inc. (\"Parent\"). There were no receivables from the Parent on the\nConsolidated Condensed Balance Sheets at January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023.\nThe Company is a party to a tax-sharing arrangement with the Parent which allocates the tax liabilities of the two Companies between them. The Company made federal\ntax payments of $4,000,000 and $3,327,000 to the Parent during the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, respectively.\nAs of January 31, 2024, the Parent owned 91.59% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.\nNote 8 - Federal, State and Local Income Taxes:\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Income Tax Topic of the FASB's ASC, the Company's provision for income taxes includes the following:\nThree Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023\nCurrent tax expense:\nFederal $ 1,195 $ 1,191 $ 3,657 $ 3,581\nState and local 469 364 979 831\nCurrent tax expense 1,664 1,555 4,636 4,412\nDeferred tax expense (benefit):\nFederal 288 184 (18) 85\nState and local (107) (68) (171) (28)\nDeferred tax expense (benefit): 181 116 (189) 57\nIncome tax provision $ 1,845 $ 1,671 $ 4,447 $ 4,469\n17\nOn December 22, 2017 H.R. 1, originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), was enacted. The Tax Act lowered the U.S. federal income tax rate (\"Federal\nTax Rate\") from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Accordingly, the Company computes Federal income tax expense using the Federal Tax Rate of 21% in fiscal year\n2019 and each year thereafter.\nThe overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 were 23.80% and\n24.15%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate during nine months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to January 31, 2023, is primarily a result of a decrease in the\nstate and local income tax rate to 3.04% from 3.39% due to changes in state and local income tax allocations. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate\nfluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax\nconsequences to pre-income tax, the Company's geographic profit mix between tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of\nexisting tax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.\nDeferred income taxes, a liability, are provided for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the Company's assets and\nliabilities. The tax effect of temporary differences giving rise to the Company's long-term deferred tax liability are as follows:\nJanuary 31, April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nFederal tax liability (benefit):\nDeferred gain on deconsolidation of EAM $ 10,669 $ 10,669\nDeferred non-cash post-employment compensation (372) (372)\nDepreciation and amortization 70 59\nUnrealized gain/(loss) on fixed income securities held for sale (7) 99\nUnrealized gain on equity securities 895 919\nRight of Use Asset (154) (174)\nDeferred charges (133) (136)\nOther (461) (432)\nTotal federal tax liability 10,507 10,632\nState and local tax liabilities (benefits):\nDeferred gain on deconsolidation of EAM 2,252 2,062\nDeferred non-cash post-employment compensation (78) (72)\nDepreciation and amortization 15 125\nUnrealized gain/(loss) on fixed income securities held for sale (2) 19\nUnrealized gain on equity securities 189 178\nOther (61) 185\nTotal state and local tax liabilities 2,315 2,497\nDeferred tax liability, long-term $ 12,822 $ 13,129\nAt the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective income tax rate to apply for the full fiscal year. The Company uses the effective income\ntax rate determined to provide for income taxes on a year-to-date basis and reflects the tax effect of any tax law changes and certain other discrete events in the period in\nwhich they occur.\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount of income tax determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income as a result of\nthe following:\nNine Months Ended January 31,\n2024 2023\nU.S. statutory federal tax rate 21.00% 21.00%\nIncrease (decrease) in tax rate from:\nState and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit 3.04% 3.39%\nEffect of dividends received deductions (0.24)% (0.25)%\nOther, net - 0.01%\nEffective income tax rate 23.80% 24.15%\nThe Company believes that, as of January 31, 2024, there were no material uncertain tax positions that would require disclosure under GAAP.\n18\nThe Company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of the Parent. The Company has a tax sharing agreement which requires it to make tax payments\nto the Parent equal to the Company's liability/(benefit) as if it filed a separate return. Beginning with the fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, the Company files combined\nincome tax returns with the Parent on a unitary basis in certain states.\nThe Company’s federal income tax returns (included in the Parent’s consolidated returns) and state and city tax returns for fiscal years ended 2020 through 2022, are\nsubject to examination by the tax authorities, generally for three years after they are filed with the tax authorities.\nNote 9 - Property and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or in\nthe case of leasehold improvements, over the remaining terms of the leases. For income tax purposes, depreciation of furniture and equipment is computed using\naccelerated methods and buildings and leasehold improvements are depreciated over prescribed extended tax lives. Property and equipment, net, on the Consolidated\nCondensed Balance Sheets was comprised of the following:\nJanuary 31, April 30,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023\nBuilding and leasehold improvements $ 1,013 $ 1,013\nOperating lease - right-of-use asset 4,399 5,300\nFurniture and equipment 4,092 4,079\n9,504 10,392\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization (4,707) (4,604)\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 4,797 $ 5,788\nNote 10 - Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use:\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Position 98-1 (SOP 98-1), \"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed for Internal Use\".\nSOP 98-1 requires companies to capitalize as long-lived assets many of the costs associated with developing or purchasing software for internal use and amortize those\ncosts over the software's estimated useful life in a systematic and rational manner. Such costs, when incurred, are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life\nof the asset, normally 3 to 5 years. Total amortization expenses during the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, were $49,000 and $36,000,\nrespectively.\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the Company did not incur and did not capitalize expenditures related to third party programmers'\ncosts nor internal costs to develope software for internal use.\nNote 11 - Treasury Stock and Repurchase Program:\nDuring October 2022, the Company's Board of Directors approved a renewal of a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock up to an aggregate purchase price of $3,000,000. The repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices, in\nnegotiated transactions off the market, in block purchases or otherwise. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time at the Company’s\ndiscretion and has no set price limit and no expiration date. There is a remainder of $1,396,000 before the authorized limit is reached.\nTreasury stock, at cost, consists of the following:\nAverage Cost Aggregate Purchase Price\n(in thousands except for shares and cost per share) Shares Cost Assigned per Share Remaining Under the Program\nBalance as of October 31, 2023 573,017 $ 15,009 $ 26.19 $ 1,396\nPurchases effected in open market during the months ended:\nNovember 30, 2023 - - - 1,396\nDecember 31, 2023 - - - 1,396\nJanuary 31, 2024 - - - 1,396\nBalance as of January 31, 2024 573,017 $ 15,009 $ 26.19 $ 1,396\n19\nNote 12 - Lease Commitments:\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”. This ASU requires that, for leases longer than one year, a lessee recognizes in the\nstatements of financial position a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability, representing the liability to\nmake lease payments. It also requires that for finance leases, a lessee recognizes interest expense on the lease liability, separately from the amortization of the right-of-\nuse asset in the statements of earnings, while for operating leases, such amounts should be recognized as a combined expense. The firm adopted this ASU in May 2019\nunder a modified retrospective approach.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02 using a modified retrospective transition approach as of the Effective Date as permitted by the amendments in ASU 2018-11, which\nprovides an alternative modified retrospective transition method. As a result, the Company was not required to adjust its comparative period financial information for\neffects of the standard or make the new required lease disclosures for periods before the date of adoption (i.e. May 1, 2019). The Company has elected to employ the\ntransitionary relief offered by the FASB and, therefore, has not reassessed (1) whether existing or expired contracts contain a lease, (2) lease classification for existing or\nexpired leases or (3) the accounting for initial direct costs that were previously capitalized.\nThe Company leases office space in New York, NY and a warehouse and appurtenant office space in Lyndhurst, NJ. The Company has evaluated these leases and\ndetermined that they are operating leases under the definitions of the guidance of ASU 2016-02. The lease in Lyndhurst, NJ will expire and the Company is making\nalternative arrangements for the functions performed at the Warehouse, subsequent to the expiration of the lease.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. For operating leases, the right-of-use asset is subsequently measured\nthroughout the lease term at the carrying amount of the lease liability, plus initial direct costs, plus (minus) any prepaid (accrued) lease payments, less the unamortized\nbalance of lease incentives received.\nOn May 1, 2019, the Company recorded a right-of-use asset in the amount of $9,575,000, which represents the lease liability of $10,340,000 adjusted for previously\nrecorded unamortized lease incentives in the amount of $765,000. The right-of-use asset is amortized over the remaining lease term in the amount equal to the difference\nbetween the calculated straight-line expense of the total lease payments less the monthly interest calculated on the remaining lease liability. As of January 31, 2024, the\nCompany had a long-term lease asset of $4,399,000 recorded in property and equipment in its Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets.\nThe Company recognizes lease expense, calculated as the remaining cost of the lease allocated over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease expense is\npresented as part of continuing operations in the consolidated condensed statements of income. The Company recognized $375,000 and $1,125,000 in lease expenses in\nboth fiscal years 2024 and 2023 during the three and nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, respectively.\nFor the nine months ended January 31, 2024, the Company paid $1,221,000 in rent relating to the leases. As a payment arising from an operating lease, the $1,221,000 is\nclassified within operating activities in the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows.\nThe Company’s leases generally do not provide an implicit interest rate, and therefore the Company estimated an incremental borrowing rate, or IBR, as of the\ncommencement date, to determine the present value of its operating lease liabilities. The IBR is defined under ASC 842 as the rate of interest that the Company would\nhave to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The following table\nreconciles the undiscounted future minimum lease payments to the total operating lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet as of\nJanuary 31, 2024:\nFiscal years ended April 30, ($ in thousands)\n2024 * $ 413\n2025 1,429\n2026 1,461\n2027 1,493\n2028 883\nTotal undiscounted future minimum lease payments 5,679\nLess: difference between undiscounted lease payments & the present value of future lease payments 548\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 5,131\n* Excludes the nine months ended January 31, 2024\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for our operating leases:\nAs of January 31, 2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 3.8\nWeighted-average discount rate 5.25%\n20\nNote 13 - Restricted Cash and Deposits:\nRestricted Money Market Investment in the noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet at January 31, 2024, includes $305,000, which represents\ncash invested in a bank money market fund securing a letter of credit (\"LOC\") in the amount of $305,000 issued to the sublandlord as a security deposit for the\nCompany's New York City leased corporate office facility. According to the sublease agreement the LOC and restricted cash were reduced from $469,000 to $305,000 in\nthe third quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nNote 14 - Concentration:\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, 32.7% of total publishing revenues of $28,484,000 were derived from a single customer.\nNote 15 - Concentration of Credit Risk:\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each institution are insured\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) up to $250,000. As of January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023, the Company had $2,268,000 and $2,427,000,\nrespectively, in excess of the FDIC insured limit. Management has concluded the excess does not represent a material risk, based on the creditworthiness of the counter\nparties.\nNote 16 – Segment Information:\nThe investment periodicals and related publications (such as digital equivalents), along with supplying the embedded Proprietary information and intellectual property\nrights, are treated as one segment, Publishing. It is the Company’s only reportable segment, and all required segment financial information can be found directly in the\nconsolidated financial statements. The accounting policies for our reportable segment are the same as those described in Note 1.\n21\nItem 2.

Value Line markets under well-known brands including Value Line®, the Value Line logo®, The Value Line Investment\nSurvey®, Smart Research, Smarter Investing™ and The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research®. The name \"Value Line\" as used to describe the Company, its\nproducts, and its subsidiaries, is a registered trademark of the Company. EULAV Asset Management Trust (“EAM”) was established to provide the investment\nmanagement services to the Value Line Funds, institutional and individual accounts and provide distribution, marketing, and administrative services to the Value Line®\nMutual Funds (\"Value Line Funds\"). The Company maintains a significant investment in EAM from which it receives payments in respect of its non-voting revenues\nand non-voting profits interests.\nThe Company’s target audiences within the investment research field are individual investors, colleges, libraries, and investment management professionals.\nIndividuals come to Value Line for complete research in one package. Institutional licensees consist of corporations, financial professionals, colleges, and municipal\nlibraries. Libraries and universities offer the Company’s detailed research to their patrons and students. Investment management professionals use the research and\nhistorical information in their day-to-day businesses. The Company has a dedicated department that solicits institutional subscriptions.\nPayments received for new and renewal subscriptions and the value of receivables for amounts billed to retail and institutional customers are recorded as\nunearned revenue until the order is fulfilled. As the orders are fulfilled, the Company recognizes revenue in equal installments over the life of the particular subscription.\nAccordingly, the subscription fees to be earned by fulfilling subscriptions after the date of a particular balance sheet are shown on that balance sheet as unearned\nrevenue within current and long-term liabilities.\nThe investment periodicals and related publications (such as digital equivalents), along with supplying the embedded Proprietary information and intellectual\nproperty rights, are treated as one segment, Publishing. It is the Company’s only reportable segment, and all required segment financial information can be found\ndirectly in the consolidated financial statements.\nAsset Management and Mutual Fund Distribution Businesses\nPursuant to the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company maintains an interest in certain revenues of EAM and a portion of the residual profits of EAM but has\nno voting authority with respect to the election or removal of the trustees of EAM or control of its business.\n23\nThe business of EAM is managed by its trustees each owning 20% of the voting interest in EAM and by its officers subject to the direction of the trustees.\nThe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM entitle it to receive a range of 41% to 55% of EAM’s revenues (excluding distribution\nrevenues) from EAM’s mutual fund and separate account business distributed quarterly and 50% of the residual profits of EAM (subject to temporary increase in\ncertain limited circumstances). The Voting Profits Interest Holders will receive the other 50% of residual profits of EAM. Distribution is not less than 90% of EAM’s\nprofits payable each fiscal quarter under the provisions of the EAM Trust Agreement.\nBusiness Environment\nThe U.S. economy performed much better than expected during calendar 2023. Last year started with talks of the possibility of at least a mild recession during the 12-\nmonth period, with restrictive monetary policies leading to a decrease in demand for goods and services. That scenario, however, did not materialize, as U.S. consumer\nspending held up in 2023 despite elevated inflation and higher interest rates. The consumer sector was buoyed by savings built up during the COVID-19 pandemic, the\nunprecedented government spending of recent years, and growth in real wages. For the full year, GDP expanded 2.5%.\nThe economy also got off to a solid start this year, but the consensus expectation is that GDP growth will slow in the second and third quarters. The Federal Reserve in\nits March Beige Book summation of economic conditions said there are signs of some fatigue in the consumer sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the\nnation’s economic output. Potential headwinds for the U.S. consumer include rising personal debt levels and still elevated interest rates. Elsewhere, both durable goods\norders and manufacturing activity were notably weaker at the start of 2024. Clearly, there are signs of some increasing sluggishness in parts of the economy. Although a\nrecession, which is defined as two-consecutive quarters of falling GDP, is not expected during calendar 2024, our view is that the pace of GDP growth will drop below 2%\nthis year.\nMeantime, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are walking a tightrope on monetary policy. The central bank does\nnot want to start cutting interest rates too early and see inflation reaccelerate. This was a problem for the U.S. economy in the late 1970s. However, the FOMC also must\nguard against staying too restrictive and risk creating stress in parts of the economy. Concerns about the negative impact of higher rates on the regional banks and the\ncommercial real estate market persist. Our stance is that the Federal Reserve will begin loosening monetary policy in the second half of this year, but a cut as early as the\nJune FOMC meeting can’t be ruled out if the economy were to weaken more than expected in the coming months.\nIn conclusion, the Federal Reserve’s restrictive monetary tightening course has clearly made a dent in inflation without disrupting the labor market. The progress has\nbeen significant enough that Fed Chairman Powell hinted in his March testimony before Congress that the central bank could begin cutting rates by midyear, perhaps\neven earlier, if inflation continues on its downward trajectory. In all, the current business environment has held up fairly well, with profit growth for S&P 500 companies\naveraging around 4% in the fourth quarter. For 2024, Wall Street anticipates low double-digit corporate earnings growth.\n24\nResults of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended January 31, 2024 and 2023\nThe following table illustrates the Company’s key components of revenues and expenses.\nThree Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands, except earnings per share) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nIncome from operations $ 2,232 $ 2,984 -25.2% $ 7,653 $ 8,713 -12.2%\nNon-voting revenues and non-voting profits\ninterests from EAM Trust 3,489 2,685 29.9% 9,341 8,516 9.7%\nIncome from operations plus non-voting\nrevenues and non-voting profits interests from\nEAM Trust $ 5,721 $ 5,669 0.9% $ 16,994 $ 17,229 -1.4%\nOperating expenses $ 6,899 $ 6,983 -1.2% $ 20,831 $ 21,264 -2.0%\nInvestment gains $ 2,009 $ 1,250 60.7% $ 1,685 $ 1,276 32.1%\nIncome before income taxes $ 7,730 $ 6,919 11.7% $ 18,679 $ 18,505 0.9%\nNet income $ 5,885 $ 5,248 12.2% $ 14,232 $ 14,036 1.4%\nEarnings per share $ 0.62 $ 0.55 12.7% $ 1.51 $ 1.48 2.0%\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, the Company’s net income of $14,232,000, or $1.51 per share, was 1.4% above net income of $14,036,000, or\n$1.48 per share, for the nine months ended January 31, 2023.

A certain amount of variation is to be\nexpected due to the volume of new orders and timing of long-term renewal contracts, direct mail campaigns and large Institutional Sales orders.\n26\nInvestment periodicals and related publications revenues\nInvestment periodicals and related publications revenues of $19,174,000 (excluding copyright fees) during the nine months ended January 31, 2024 were 3.1%\nbelow publishing revenues of $19,795,000, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The Company continued activity to attract new subscribers, primarily digital\nsubscriptions through various marketing channels, primarily direct mail, e-mail, and by the efforts of our sales personnel. As fewer individual investors manage their\nown portfolios, total product line circulation at January 31, 2024, was 3.6% below total product line circulation at January 31, 2023. However, Institutional Sales\ndepartment total sales orders reached a record level in the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023 and this growing, more profitable business with financial advisors and\nprofessional investors significantly offsets the long-term trend of declining individual investor circulation.\nCirculation also reflected management’s decision to reduce marketing efforts temporarily while the challenging stock market environment persisted. Total print\ncirculation at January 31, 2024 was 5.0% below the total print circulation at January 31, 2023. During the nine months ended January 31, 2024, print publication revenues\nof $6,987,000 decreased 7.3%, below print publication revenues of $7,539,000 during the same quarter of 2023. Total digital circulation at January 31, 2024 was 1.7% below\ntotal digital circulation at January 31, 2023 with the professional clientele offsetting the decline in individual subscribers. During the nine months ended January 31, 2024,\ndigital revenues of $12,187,000 were down 0.6% as compared to the prior fiscal year. These figures reflect weak investor sentiment, likely temporary, and the ongoing\nshift from our print services to digital counterparts. Sales of our higher-price, higher-profit, publications have been stronger than sales of lower price “starter” products.\nValue Line serves primarily individual and professional investors in stocks, and other securities, who pay mostly on annual or multi-year subscription plans, for\nbasic services or as much as $100,000 or more annually for comprehensive premium quality research, not obtainable elsewhere. The ongoing goal of adding new\nsubscribers has led us to introduce publications and packages at a range of price points.\nThe Value Line Proprietary Ranks (the “Ranking System”), a component of the Company’s flagship product, The Value Line Investment Survey, are also utilized\nin the Company’s copyright business. The Ranking System is made available to EAM for specific uses without charge. During the twelve month period ended January\n31, 2024, the combined Ranking System “Rank 1 & 2” stocks’ increase of 9.1% compared favorably to the Russell 2000 Index’s increase of 0.8% during the comparable\nperiod.\nCopyright fees\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, copyright fees of $9,310,000 were 8.6% below those during the corresponding period in the prior fiscal year.\nThese fees depend on the assets under management in financial products with contractual arrangements to use the Ranks and other Value Line proprietary information.\nInvestment management fees and services – (unconsolidated)\nThe Company has substantial non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM, the asset manager to the Value Line Mutual Funds. Accordingly,\nthe Company does not report this operation as a separate business segment, although it maintains a significant interest in the cash flows generated by this business\nand will receive ongoing payments in respect of its non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests.\nTotal assets in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at January 31, 2024, were $4.06 billion, which is $1.02 billion, or 33.6%, above total\nassets of $3.04 billion in the Value Line Funds managed and/or distributed by EAM at January 31, 2023.\n27\nValue Line Mutual Funds\nAs of January 31,\n($ in millions) 2024 2023 Change\nEquity and hybrid funds $ 4,019 $ 2,993 34.3%\nFixed income funds 37 42 -11.9%\nTotal EAM managed net assets $ 4,056 $ 3,035 33.6%\nEAM Trust - Results of operations before distribution to interest holders\nThe gross fees and net income of EAM’s investment management operations during the nine months ended January 31, 2024, before interest holder\ndistributions, included total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of $17,388,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of 4,811,000 and other net gains of\n$295,000. For the same period, total investment management fee waivers were $239,000 and 12b-1 fee waivers were $72,000. During the nine months ended January 31,\n2024, EAM's net income was $1,842,000 after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest of $8,420,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest\nholders and to the Company in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nThe gross fees and net income of EAM’s investment management operations during the nine months ended January 31, 2023, before interest holder\ndistributions, included total investment management fees earned from the Value Line Funds of $14,951,000, 12b-1 fees and other fees of $4,507,000 and other net gains of\n$150,000.

During the nine months ended January 31,\n2023, EAM's net income was $1,198,000 after giving effect to Value Line’s non-voting revenues interest of $7,917,000, but before distributions to voting profits interest\nholders and to the Company in respect of its 50% non-voting profits interest.\nAs of January 31, 2024, one of the Value Line Funds has full 12b-1 fees waivers in place, and five funds have partial investment management fee waivers in\nplace. Although, under the terms of the EAM Declaration of Trust, the Company does not receive or share in the revenues from 12b-1 distribution fees, the Company\ncould benefit from the fee waivers to the extent that the resulting reduction of expense ratios and enhancement of the performance of the Value Line Funds attracts new\nassets.\nThe Value Line equity and hybrid funds’ assets represent 99.1% and fixed income fund assets represent 0.90%, respectively, of total fund assets under\nmanagement (“AUM”) as of January 31, 2024.

During\nthe nine months ended January 31, 2024, decreases were primarily due to decreases in renewal solicitations and sales commissions.\nSalaries and employee benefits\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, salaries and employee benefits of $11,156,000 decreased 3.6% below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to\ndecreases in salaries and employee benefits resulting from reduced employee headcount in fiscal year 2024.\nProduction and distribution\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, production and distribution expenses of $4,094,000 increased 6.9% above prior fiscal year primarily due to\nincreases in production support of the Company’s website and maintenance of the Company’s publishing and application software and operating systems. Increase in\nthird party distribution expense is associated with outsourcing and upgrading a portion of our customer fulfillment operations.\n29\nOffice and administration\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, office and administrative expenses of $3,442,000 decreased 4.8% below the prior fiscal year, primarily due to\ndecreases in professional fees and utilities.\nConcentration\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, 32.7% of total publishing revenues of $28,484,000 were derived from a single customer.\nInvestment gains / (losses)\nThree Months Ended January 31, Nine Months Ended January 31,\n($ in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\nDividend income $ 153 $ 190 -19.5% $ 431 $ 444 -2.9%\nInterest income 511 194 163.4% 1,387 395 251.1%\nInvestment gains/(losses) recognized on sale\nof equity securities during the period 2 7 -71.4% (1) 12 108.3%\nUnrealized gains/(losses) recognized on equity\nsecurities held at the end of the period 1,343 859 56.3% (132) 425 -131.1%\nTotal investment gains $ 2,009 $ 1,250 60.7% $ 1,685 $ 1,276 32.1%\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, the Company’s investment gains, primarily derived from dividend and interest income, investment gains\nrecognized on sales of equity securities during the period and unrealized gains recognized on equity securities held at the end of the period in fiscal 2024, resulted in\ninvestment gains of $1,685,000. During the nine months ended January 31, 2023, the Company’s investment gains, primarily derived from dividend and interest income,\ninvestment gains recognized on sales of equity securities during the period and unrealized gains recognized on equity securities held at January 31, 2023 in fiscal 2023,\nresulted in investment gains of $1,276,000. Proceeds from the sales of equity securities during the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 were\n$1,129,000 and $1,421,000, respectively.\nEffective income tax rate\nThe overall effective income tax rates, as a percentage of pre-tax ordinary income for the nine months ended January 31, 2024 and January 31, 2023 were 23.80%\nand 24.15%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate during nine months ended January 31, 2024 as compared to January 31, 2023, is primarily a result of a decrease in\nthe state and local income taxes from 3.39% to 3.04% due to changes in state and local income tax allocations. The Company's annualized overall effective tax rate\nfluctuates due to a number of factors, in addition to changes in tax law, including but not limited to an increase or decrease in the ratio of items that do not have tax\nconsequences to pre-tax income, the Company's geographic profit mix among tax jurisdictions, taxation method adopted by each locality, new interpretations of existing\ntax laws and rulings and settlements with tax authorities.\n30\nLease Commitments\nOn November 30, 2016, Value Line, Inc. received consent from the landlord at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY to the terms of a new sublease agreement\nbetween Value Line, Inc. and ABM Industries, Incorporated commencing on December 1, 2016. Pursuant to the agreement Value Line leased from ABM 24,726 square\nfeet of office space located on the second and third floors at 551 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY (“Building” or “Premises”) beginning on December 1, 2016 and ending on\nNovember 29, 2027. Base rent under the sublease agreement is $1,126,000 per annum during the first year with an annual increase in base rent of 2.25% scheduled for\neach subsequent year, payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, subject to customary concessions in the Company’s favor and pass-\nthrough of certain increases in utility costs and real estate taxes over the base year. The Company provided a security deposit represented by a letter of credit in the\namount of $469,000 in October 2016, which was reduced to $305,000 on October 3, 2021 and is to be fully refunded after the sublease ends. This Building became the\nCompany’s new corporate office facility. The Company is required to pay for certain operating expenses associated with the Premises as well as utilities supplied to the\nPremises. The sublease terms provide free rent for the first six months of the sublease. Sublandlord provided Value Line a work allowance of $417,000 which\naccompanied with the six months free rent worth $563,000 was applied against the Company’s obligation to pay rent at our NYC headquarters, delaying the actual rent\npayments until November 2017.\nOn February 29, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary VLDC and Seagis Property Group LP (the “Landlord”) entered into a lease agreement, pursuant to which VLDC\nhas leased 24,110 square feet of warehouse and appurtenant office space located at 205 Chubb Ave., Lyndhurst, NJ (“Warehouse”) beginning on May 1, 2016 and\nending on April 30, 2024 (“Lease”). Base rent under the Lease is $192,880 per annum payable in equal monthly installments on the first day of each month, in advance\nduring fiscal 2017 and increasing to $237,218 in fiscal 2024, subject to customary increases based on operating costs and real estate taxes. The Company provided a\nsecurity deposit in cash in the amount of $32,146, which will be fully refunded after the lease term expires. The lease is a net lease requiring the Company to pay for\ncertain operating expenses associated with the Warehouse as well as utilities supplied to the Warehouse. The Company is making alternative arrangements for the\nfunctions performed at the Warehouse, subsequent to the expiration of the lease.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company had working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, of $47,658,000 as of January 31, 2024 and $42,788,000 as of April 30, 2023.\nThese amounts include short-term unearned revenue of $15,953,000 and $16,771,000 reflected in total current liabilities at January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023,\nrespectively. Cash and short-term securities were $67,299,000 and $62,064,000 as of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents include $4,739,000 and $7,240,000 at January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, respectively, invested primarily in\ncommercial banks and in Money Market Funds at brokers, which operate under Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act and invest primarily in short-term U.S. government securities.\nCash from operating activities\nThe Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $14,169,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2024, compared to cash inflows of\n$13,978,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2023. The increase in cash inflows was a result of increased interest income, the timing of receipts from accounts\nreceivable and slowdown in the decline of unearned revenue from the same period last year.\nCash from investing activities\nThe Company had cash outflows from investing activities of $7,719,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2024, compared to cash outflows from\ninvesting activities of $20,222,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023, respectively. The lower cash outflows for the nine months ended January 31, 2024\ncompared to January 31, 2023, was primarily due to increases in proceeds from maturities of fixed income securities.\n31\nCash from financing activities\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2024, the Company’s cash outflows from financing activities were $8,260,000, compared to cash outflows from\nfinancing activities of $11,598,000 for the nine months ended January 31, 2023. Quarterly dividend payments of $0.28 per share during fiscal year 2024 aggregated\n$7,922,000. Quarterly regular dividend payments of $0.25 per share during fiscal year 2023 aggregated $7,111,000.\nAt January 31, 2024 there were 9,429,575 common shares outstanding as compared to 9,465,955 common shares outstanding at January 31, 2023. The Company\nexpects financing activities to continue to include use of cash for dividend payments for the foreseeable future.\nDebt and Liquid Assets\nManagement believes that the Company’s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with future cash flows from operations and from\nthe Company’s non-voting revenues and non-voting profits interests in EAM will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted liquidity needs for the next twelve\nmonths and beyond. Management does not anticipate making any borrowings during the next twelve months. As of January 31, 2024, retained earnings and liquid\nassets were $102,292,000 and $67,299,000, respectively. As of April 30, 2023, retained earnings and liquid assets were $95,979,000 and $62,064,000, respectively. There are\nno off-balance-sheet arrangements, so none affect the interpretations of reported assets, liquidity, and debt.\nSeasonality\nOur publishing revenues are comprised of subscriptions which are generally annual subscriptions. Our cash flows from operating activities are minimally\nseasonal in nature, primarily due to the timing of customer payments made for orders and subscription renewals.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThe Company prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as in effect in the United States\n(U.S. “GAAP”). The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenues and expenses. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent, and the\nCompany evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe Company’s critical accounting policy relates to the valuation of EAM. There have been no material changes in our critical accounting policies during the\nnine months ended January 31, 2024. For a complete discussion of our critical accounting policies, refer to “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” discussed in\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year\nended April 30, 2023.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are a party to lease contracts which will result in cash payments to lessors in future periods. Operating lease liabilities are included in our Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter are (in thousands): $413 in 2024; $1,429 in 2025; $1,461 in 2026;\n$1,493 in 2027 and $883 in 2028 totaling $5,679.\n32\nItem 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nThe Company’s Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks. The Company’s\nmarket risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity price risk. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with the Company’s\ninvestment activities.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk. Despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that\nlosses may occur. To limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes, the Company’s management invests primarily in short-term obligations\nmaturing within one year.\nThe fair values of the Company’s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in prevailing\ninterest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be\naffected by prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, and other general market conditions.\nFixed income securities consist of bank certificates of deposits and securities issued by federal, state and local governments within the United States. As of\nJanuary 31, 2024 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $46,184,000 and $46,149,000, respectively. As of April 30,\n2023 the aggregate cost and fair value of fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale were $39,455,000 and $39,928,000, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk. It\nis assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks. The hypothetical changes in market interest\nrates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments\ndue to prepayment options available. For these reasons, actual results might differ from those reflected in the table.\nFixed Income Securities\nEstimated Fair Value after\nHypothetical Change in Interest Rates\n(in thousands)\n(bp = basis points)\n1 year 1 year 1 year 1 year\nFair 50 bp 50 bp 100 bp 100 bp\nValue increase decrease increase decrease\nAs of January 31, 2024\nInvestments in securities with fixed maturities $ 46,149 $ 44,904 $ 45,269 $ 44,722 $ 45,452\nAs of April 30, 2023\nInvestments in securities with fixed maturities $ 39,928 $ 39,202 $ 39,512 $ 39,048 $ 39,667\nManagement regularly monitors the maturity structure of the Company’s investments in debt securities in order to maintain an acceptable price risk associated\nwith changes in interest rates.\n33\nEquity Price Risk\nThe carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet dates. Market prices are subject to\nfluctuation and, consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the\nmarket price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments and\ngeneral market conditions. Furthermore, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold.\nThe Company’s equity investment strategy has been to acquire equity securities across a diversity of industry groups. The portfolio consists of ETFs held for\ndividend yield that attempt to replicate the performance of certain equity indexes. In order to maintain liquidity in these securities, the Company’s policy has been to\ninvest in and hold in its portfolio, no more than 5% of the approximate average daily trading volume in any one issue.\nAs of January 31, 2024 and April 30, 2023, the aggregate cost of the equity securities, which consist of investments in the SPDR Series Trust S&P Dividend ETF\n(SDY), First Trust Value Line Dividend Index ETF (FVD), ProShares Trust S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL), IShares DJ Select Dividend ETF (DVY), and other\nExchange Traded Funds was a combined total of $11,109,000 and $10,169,000, respectively, and the fair value was $15,370,000 and $14,546,000, respectively.\nEquity Securities Hypothetical\nPercentage\nEstimated Fair Increase\nValue after (Decrease) in\nHypothetical Hypothetical Shareholders’\n($ in thousands) Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Equity\nEquity Securities and ETFs\nAs of January 31, 2024 held for dividend yield $ 15,370 30% increase $ 19,982 4.08%\n30% decrease $ 10,760 (4.08%)\nEquity Securities Hypothetical\nPercentage\nEstimated Fair Increase\nValue after (Decrease) in\nHypothetical Hypothetical Shareholders’\n($ in thousands) Fair Value Price Change Change in Prices Equity\nEquity Securities and ETFs\nAs of April 30, 2023 held for dividend yield $ 14,546 30% increase $ 18,910 4.12%\n30% decrease $ 10,182 (4.12%)\n34\nItem 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized\nand reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nThe Company’s management has evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, the effectiveness\nof the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as\nof the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that the\nCompany’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\n(b) The registrant’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that there have been no changes in the registrant’s internal control\nover financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nregistrant’s internal control over financial reporting.\nPart II – OTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1. Legal Proceedings\nNone.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nIn Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2024 new risk factors have been added to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A -\nRisk Factors in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on July 28, 2023. The new risk factors reflect\nmanagement's continuing analysis of developments in the Company's business environment, rather than any specific event or particular issue.\n35\nItem 2.

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s finan-\ncial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reason-\nable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required\nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was com-\nmunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to the accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entity\nAs described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the equity method of accounting to report its investment in its uncon-\nsolidated entity. As of April 30, 2024, the carrying value of the investment was $60,134,000. On an annual basis, management performs an impairment\nassessment to ensure that the carrying value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity is properly reflected.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to such assessment is a critical audit matter are that there were\nsignificant judgements made by management in estimating the fair value of the investment and the fact that management utilized a specialist to assist in\nits determination of fair value. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity, and audit effort in evaluating management’s estimation\nof the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity, including management’s assessment of the unconsolidated entity’s financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included, among others, reviewing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the investment in its\nunconsolidated entity, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the model, and evalu-\nating the significant assumptions used by management.\n/s/ Horowitz & Ullmann, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.\nNew York, NY\nJuly 25, 2024\n42\nn\nMiscellaneous\nBoard of Directors Common Stock Performance\nStephen R.

          "content": "2023\nANNUAL REPORT\nn\nChairman’s Letter\nTo Our Shareholders:\nWe are pleased to report that Value Line’s Fiscal Year which ended April 30, 2023 was a successful one.\nThe Company earned $18,069,000 or $1.91 per share and as a result the Board of Directors voted to increase\nthe Value Line dividend for the ninth consecutive year. Our quarterly dividend rose by 3 cents per share or\n12.0% to 28 cents per share per quarter or $1.12/share per year. Based on the closing price of Value Line stock\nas of April 30, 2023 of $45.80/share, our dividend yield was 2.45%.\nMoreover, Income from Operations of $11,470,000 reached its highest level in more than a decade, up\n$670,000 or 6.2% compared with Income from Operations in Fiscal 2022. Value Line’s Retained Earnings\nof $95,979,000 as of April 30, 2023, grew by almost $8,334,000 or 9.5% compared to that of a year earlier.\nIn addition, despite high inflation rates and product supply shortages, Value Line continued to implement its\npolicy of careful cost management, resulting in Operating Expenses declining by $1,500,000 or 5.0%.\nAfter a difficult 2022 calendar year during which the S&P 500 dropped 18%, calendar 2023 has so far been\nmore favorable for the growth of stock prices. Nevertheless, Value Line’s Institutional Sales business recorded\nthe highest level of sales ever during fiscal 2023 as more than 90% of our institutional customers renewed their\nsubscriptions and several large customers in the U.S., Asia, and in the Fintech sector became new Value Line\ncustomers. Looking forward, we expect that our Institutional business will continue to do well and believe\nthat during fiscal 2024 more retail investors will return to the market resulting in many of them subscribing\nto more than one of Value Line’s services.\nDuring Fiscal 2023, our copyright business, which focuses on safe and strong dividend paying stocks, also\ngenerated higher revenue compared with the preceding fiscal year. This is exactly the strategy many investors\nwho choose to stay invested, despite market tumult, are searching for.\nNon-voting revenues and profits interests from Eulav Asset Management did not perform well this year due to\na shift in stock market thinking. The Eulav Asset Management strategy focuses on identifying growth oriented\nstocks which often don’t pay dividends and which tend to do well during periods of low interest rates. During\ncalendar 2022, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates to levels not seen in decades. The result was\nan investor shift away from growth stocks and into value stocks that are viewed as safer and that usually pay\ndividends. So far in calendar 2023, a number of economists have predicted that the Federal Reserve is at or\nnear the end of its interest raising cycle and that there is less risk of a recession, making stocks more inviting,\nwhich is why Eulav Asset Management’s fund assets have been rising again.\nIn this, our 92nd year of business, our strategy is to continue to offer high quality, independently sourced\ninformation and analysis on stocks, funds, and options for all types of investors including the investing\npublic, academic and municipal libraries, and Wall Street professionals here and overseas. This is the legacy\nof our founder, Arnold Bernhard, the “Dean of Wall Street,” who began our publishing business in 1931\nand was one of the pioneers of the post-war mutual funds business.\nWe are proud of this year’s accomplishments for you, our shareholders, and for our customers who place\ntheir confidence in us. In the year ahead we intend to do our best to successfully manage each challenge\nwe’ll face and to work hard to deserve your continuing trust.\nSincerely,\nHoward A.

In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash\nflows for each of the years in the three-year period ended April 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) and are\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reason-\nable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required\nto have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures\nin the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was com-\nmunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to the accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does\nnot alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter\nbelow, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Entity\nAs described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses the equity method of accounting to report its investment in its uncon-\nsolidated entity. As of April 30, 2023, the carrying value of the investment was $58,775,000. On an annual basis, management performs an impairment\nassessment to ensure that the carrying value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity is properly reflected.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to such assessment is a critical audit matter are that there were\nsignificant judgements made by management in estimating the fair value of the investment and the fact that management utilized a specialist to assist in\nits determination of fair value. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgement, subjectivity, and audit effort in evaluating management’s estimation\nof the fair value of the investment in its unconsolidated entity, including management’s assessment of the unconsolidated entity’s financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included, among others, reviewing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the investment in its\nunconsolidated entity, evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model, testing the completeness and accuracy of data used in the model, and evalu-\nating the significant assumptions used by management.\n/s/ Horowitz & Ullmann, P.C.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1996.\nNew York, NY\nJuly 27, 2023\n42\nn\nMiscellaneous\nBoard of Directors Common Stock Performance\nStephen R.
