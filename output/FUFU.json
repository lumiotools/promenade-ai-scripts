(the “Company”) in any jurisdiction or\nan inducement to enter into investment activity, nor may it or any part of it form the basis of or be relied on in connection with any contract or commitment\nwhatsoever. This presentation does not contain all relevant information relating to the Company or its securities, particularly with respect to the risks and special\nconsiderations involved with an investment in the securities of the Company. This presentation does not constitute legal, regulatory, accounting or tax advice to you.\nWe recommend that you seek independent third party legal, regulatory, accounting and tax advice regarding the contents of this presentation. This presentation does\nnot constitute and should not be considered as any form of financial opinion or recommendation by the Company or any other party.\nThis presentation includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act\nof 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “forecast,” “intend,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,”\n“seek,” “target” or other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the\nCompany's beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this presentation,\nand on the current expectations of BitFuFu's management and are not predictions of actual performance. These statements involve risks, uncertainties and other\nfactors that may cause BitFuFu's actual results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these\nforward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that it has a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this presentation, the\nCompany cautions you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known and projections of the future, which are inherently\nuncertain. All information provided in this presentation is as of the date of this presentation and the Company does not undertake any duty to update such information,\nexcept as required under applicable law.\nThe Company uses certain financial measures that are not recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) in evaluating its\nbusiness. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not\nreflect all items of income and expense that affect the Company’s operations. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP measures used by other\ncompanies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The use of such non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nPAGE 2\nBitFuFu\nMission Statement\nAt BitFuFu, our mission is to make Bitcoin mining accessible\nto everyone. Through our innovative cloud-mining platform,\nwe eliminate the barriers of high initial costs and technical\ncomplexity of traditional mining, enabling individuals and\nbusinesses to participate in the future of the digital economy.\nPAGE 3\nBitFuFu\nBitFuFu: Introduction and milestones\nA fast-growing digital asset mining service and world-leading cloud-mining service provider headquartered in Singapore\nPIPE Customer 9-Month 2024\nInvestment Recognition Earnings\nDec 2020 Mar 2021 Jul 2021 Jan 2022 Dec 2023 Mar 2024\nHashrate selling Antpool & BitFuFu BITMAIN BITMAIN and Registered Listed on Nasdaq Revenue:\nplatform went live begin strategic invested in Antpool commit to users surpass Adj.
