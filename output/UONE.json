An LMA or a TBA is an agreement under which a\nFederal Communications Commission (“FCC”) licensee of a radio station makes available, for a fee, airtime on its station to another party. The other party provides programming to be\nbroadcast during the airtime and collects revenues from advertising it sells for broadcast during that programming. In addition to entering into LMAs or TBAs, we will, from time to time,\nenter into management or consulting agreements that provide us with the ability, as contractually specified, to assist current owners in the management of radio station assets that we have\ncontracted to purchase, subject to FCC approval. In such arrangements, we generally receive a contractually specified management fee or consulting fee in exchange for the services\nprovided.\nThe radio broadcasting industry commonly refers to “station operating income” which consists of net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest\nexpense, interest income, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, other income, net, loss from unconsolidated joint venture, corporate selling, general and administrative\nexpenses, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets and (gain) loss on retirement of debt. However, given the diverse nature of our\nbusiness, station operating income is not truly reflective of our multi-media operation and, therefore, we use the term broadcast and digital operating income. Broadcast and digital\noperating income is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Nevertheless, broadcast and digital operating\nincome is a significant basis used by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our core operating segments. Broadcast and digital operating income provides helpful\ninformation about our results of operations, apart from expenses associated with our fixed and long-lived intangible assets, income taxes, investments, impairment charges, debt\nfinancings and retirements, corporate overhead and stock-based compensation. Our measure of broadcast and digital operating income is similar to our historic use of station operating\nincome; however, it reflects our more diverse business, and therefore, may not be similar to “station operating income” or other similarly titled measures as used by other companies.\nBroadcast and digital operating income does not represent operating income or loss, or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance.\nUnless otherwise indicated:\n● we obtained total radio industry revenue levels from the Radio Advertising Bureau (the “RAB”);\n● we obtained audience share and ranking information from Nielsen Audio, Inc. (“Nielsen”); and\n● we derived historical market statistics and market revenue share percentages from data published by Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP (“Miller Kaplan”), a public\naccounting firm that specializes in serving the broadcasting industry and BIA/Kelsey (“BIA”), a media and telecommunications advisory services firm.\n3\nTable of Contents\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nOur disclosure and analysis in this annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (“Form 10-K”) concerning our operations, cash flows and financial position,\ncontain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-\nlooking statements do not relay historical facts, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future operations, results and events. All statements other than statements of\nhistorical fact are “forward-looking statements” including any projections of earnings, revenues or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of\nmanagement for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new activities, services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance;\nany statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. You can identify some of these forward-looking statements by our use of words such as\n“anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “likely,” “may,” “estimates” and similar expressions. You can also identify a forward-looking statement in that such\nstatements discuss matters in a way that anticipates operations, results or events that have not already occurred but rather will or may occur in future periods. We cannot guarantee that we\nwill achieve any forward-looking plans, intentions, results, operations or expectations. Because these statements apply to future events, they are subject to risks and uncertainties, some of\nwhich are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasted or anticipated in the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and\nfactors include (in no particular order), but are not limited to:\n• public health crises, epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19 and other future pandemics and their impact on our business and the businesses of our advertisers, including\ndisruptions and inefficiencies in the supply chain;\n• lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (particularly in our largest markets, Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte; Dallas; Houston; Indianapolis; and Washington, DC), including\nchanges in social and business dynamics and the impact of any future outbreaks or variants and reduced government stimulus, the impact on our employees, and the extent of the impact\nof the changes in social and business dynamics on overall demand for advertising across our various media;\n• recession, economic volatility, financial market unpredictability and fluctuations in the United States and other world economies that may affect our business and financial\ncondition, and the business and financial conditions of our advertisers;\n• our degree of leverage, certain cash commitments related thereto, and potential inability to finance strategic transactions given fluctuations in market conditions;\n• fluctuations in the local economies of the markets in which we operate (particularly our largest markets, Atlanta; Baltimore; Charlotte; Dallas; Houston; Indianapolis; and\nWashington, DC) or fluctuations within individual business sectors experiencing a downturn even in the absence of a broader recession could negatively impact our ability to meet our\ncash needs;\n• increased costs due to inflation or any changes in music royalty fees;\n• risks associated with the implementation and execution of our business diversification strategy, including our strategic actions with respect to expansion into gaming;\n• risks associated with our investments or potential investment in gaming businesses;\n• regulation by the FCC relative to maintaining our broadcasting licenses, enacting media ownership rules and enforcing of indecency rules;\n• changes in our key personnel and on-air talent;\n• increases in competition for and in the costs of our programming and content, including on-air talent and content production or acquisitions availability/costs;\n4\nTable of Contents\n• financial losses that may be incurred due to impairment charges against our broadcasting licenses, goodwill, and other intangible assets;\n• increased competition for advertising revenues with other radio stations, broadcast and cable television, newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail, internet\nradio, satellite radio, smart phones, tablets, and other wireless media, the internet, social media, and other forms of advertising;\n• the impact of our acquisitions, dispositions and similar transactions, as well as consolidation in industries in which we and our advertisers operate;\n• developments and/or changes in laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act or other similar federal or state regulation through legislative action and\nrevised rules and standards;\n• disruptions to our technology network including computer systems and software, whether by man-made or other disruptions of our operating systems, structures or equipment,\nincluding as we further develop alternative work arrangements, as well as natural events such as pandemic, severe weather, fires, floods and earthquakes;\n• material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not remediated, could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial\nstatements;\n• failure to meet the continued listing standards of NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”), which could cause our common stock to be delisted, and which could have a material\nadverse effect on the liquidity and market price of our common stock and expose the Company to litigation; and\n• other factors mentioned in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) including the factors discussed in detail in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” contained in\nthis report.\nYou should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our views based only on information currently available to us as of the date of this report. We\nundertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements because of new information, future events or otherwise.\n5\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nUrban One, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries, (collectively, “Urban One,” the “Company”, “we”, “our” and/or “us”) is an urban-oriented, multi-media company that\nprimarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation that primarily targets\nAfrican-American and urban listeners. As of December 31, 2023, we owned and/or operated 72 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 57 FM or AM\nstations, 13 HD stations, and the 2 low power television stations we operate), located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States. While a core source of\nour revenue has historically been and remains the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, our strategy is to operate the premier multi-media\nentertainment and information content platform targeting African-American and urban consumers. Thus, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments\nin other complementary media properties. Our diverse media and entertainment interests include TV One, LLC (“TV One”), which operates two cable television networks targeting\nAfrican-American and urban viewers, TV One and CLEO TV; our 90.0% ownership interest in Reach Media, Inc. (“Reach Media”) which operates the Rickey Smiley Morning Show and\nour other syndicated programming assets, including the Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell Show, and the DL Hughley Show; and Interactive One, LLC (“Interactive One”), our\nwholly owned digital platform serving the African-American community through social content, news, information, and entertainment websites, including its iONE Digital, Cassius and\nBossip, HipHopWired and MadameNoire digital platforms and brands. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its investment in MGM National\nHarbor (the “MGM Investment”), a gaming resort located in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Please refer to Note 3(q) – Investments of our consolidated financial statements for more\ndetails. Through our national multi-media operations, we provide advertisers with a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to communicate with African-American and urban\naudiences.\nOur core radio broadcasting franchise operates under the brand “Radio One.” We also operate other brands, such as TV One, CLEO TV, Reach Media, iONE Digital and One\nSolution, while developing additional branding reflective of our diverse media operations and our targeting of African-American and urban audiences.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Urban One and subsidiaries in which Urban One has a controlling financial interest, which is generally\ndetermined when the Company holds a majority voting interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interests have been\nrecognized where a controlling interest exists, but the Company owns less than 100% of the controlled entity.\nThe Company is required to include in its consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of variable interest entities (“VIE”). Under the VIE model, the Company\nconsolidates an investment if it has control to direct the activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the\nVIE.\nRecent Developments\nOn April 11, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Cox Media Group (“the CMG Acquisition”) to purchase its Houston radio cluster. Under the\nterms of the agreement, the Company agreed to acquire 93Q Country KKBQ-FM, classic rock station The Eagle 106.9 & 107.5 KHPT-FM and KGLK-FM, and Country Legends 97.1\nKTHT-FM. The transaction price was $27.5 million. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2023. As part of the FCC approval of and closing conditions of the CMG Acquisition,\nthe Company was required to divest two stations KTHT-FM and KROI-FM before it could close the CMG Acquisition. On June 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive asset\npurchase agreement with Educational Media Foundation (“EMF”) to sell KTHT-FM, and all its assets, for $3.1 million (“the KTHT Divestiture”). Immediately prior to the closing of the\nCMG Acquisition on August 1, 2023, the KTHT-FM assets were transferred directly into an irrevocable trust until the sale to EMF was finalized. On November 1, 2023, after the\napproval by the FCC, the KTHT Divestiture was completed.\n6\nTable of Contents\nIn anticipation of the FCC divestiture requirement and the CMG Acquisition, the Company agreed to sell its KROI-FM radio broadcasting license along with the associated station\nassets from the radio broadcasting segment to an unrelated third party for approximately $7.5 million. The identified assets and liabilities of KROI-FM have a combined carrying value of\napproximately $9.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The major category of the assets included radio broadcasting licenses in the amount of approximately $7.3 million (net of\nimpairment of approximately $16.8 million included in impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets, on the consolidated statement of operations). On August 1, 2023,\nimmediately prior to the closing of the CMG Acquisition, the identified assets and liabilities were transferred to an irrevocable trust and removed from the Company’s ownership and\nconsolidated balance sheet as part of customary closing terms. The identified assets and liabilities will remain in the trust until the transaction is complete, which is anticipated to occur in\n2024. As the identified assets and liabilities of KROI-FM were held in an irrevocable trust and the respective divestiture had not been completed as of December 31, 2023, the Company\nhas recorded a right to receive payment from KROI-FM’s acquirer as a receivable of $5.6 million within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nSegments\nAs part of our consolidated financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we have provided selected\nfinancial information on the Company’s four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) cable television; (iii) Reach Media; and (iv) digital. Business activities unrelated to these\nfour segments are included in an “all other” category which the Company refers to as “All Other - Corporate/Eliminations.” (See Note 15 – Segment Information of our consolidated\nfinancial statements.)\nOur Radio Station Portfolio, Strategy and Markets\nAs noted above, our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation in the country primarily targeting African-American and urban\nlisteners. Within the markets in which we operate, we strive to build clusters of radio stations with each radio station targeting different demographic segments of the African-American\npopulation. This clustering and programming segmentation strategy allows us to achieve greater penetration within the distinct segments of our overall target market. In addition, we have\nbeen able to achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating office and studio space where possible to minimize duplicative management positions and reduce overhead expenses.\nDepending on market conditions, changes in ratings methodologies and economic and demographic shifts, from time to time, we may reprogram some of our stations in underperforming\nsegments of certain markets.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned and/or operated 72 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 57 FM or AM stations, 13 HD stations, and the 2\nlow power television stations we operate but excluding translators) located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States. The following tables set forth\nfurther selected information about our portfolio of radio stations that we owned and/or operated as of December 31, 2023.\n7\nTable of Contents\nUrban One Market Data\nEntire Audience Ranking by Size of Estimated Fall 2023\nFour Book African-American Metro\nAverage Audience Population Persons Population Persons\nMarket Number of Stations* Share(1) 12+(2) 12+\nAfrican-\nTotal American\nFM AM HD LP/TV** (millions) %\nAtlanta 4 1 15.4 2 5.2 36\nWashington, DC 4 2 10.9 3 5.1 27\nDallas 2 3.8 5 6.6 18\nHouston 5 4 21.1 6 6.2 18\nPhiladelphia 2 2 4.5 7 4.7 20\nBaltimore 2 2 1 13.1 11 2.4 30\nCharlotte 5 1 1 20.4 12 2.5 23\nRaleigh-Durham 4 16.7 19 1.8 21\nCleveland 2 2 1 12.2 21 1.8 20\nRichmond 4 2 18.0 25 1.1 29\nColumbus 5 1 7.2 26 1.8 18\nIndianapolis 5 1 2 1 32.3 30 1.7 17\nCincinnati 2 1 1 6.1 34 1.9 13\nTotal 46 11 13 2\n(1) Audience share data are for the 12+ demographic and derived from the Nielsen Survey ending with the Fall 2023 Nielsen Survey.\n(2) Population estimates are from the Nielsen Radio Market Survey Population, Rankings and Information, Fall 2023.\n* 19 non-independently formatted HD stations and 14 non-independently formatted translators owned and operated by the Company are not included in the above station count.\nChanges in the programming of our HD stations or translators may alter our station count from time to time.\n** Low power television station\nMarket Rank Metro\nMarket Population 2023 Format Target Demo\nAtlanta 7\nWAMJ/WUMJ Urban AC 25-54\nWHTA Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWPZE Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nWAMJ-HD2 Urban Contemporary 25-54\nWashington DC 8\nWKYS Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWMMJ/WDCJ Urban AC 25-54\nWPRS Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nWOL-AM News/Talk 35-64\nWYCB-AM Gospel 35-64\nPhiladelphia 9\nWPPZ Adult Contemporary 25-54\nWRNB Urban Contemporary 25-54\nWPPZ-HD2 Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\n8\nTable of Contents\nWRNB-HD2 Urban AC 25-54\nHouston 6\nKBXX Urban Contemporary 18-34\nKMJQ Urban AC 25-54\nKKBQ Country 25-54\nKGLK/KHPT Classic Rock 25-54\nKMJQ HD2 Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nWGLK HD2 Variety 80s/90s 25-54\nKKBQ HD 2 Country Legends 25-54\nKKBQ HD 3 Texas Country 25-54\nDallas 5\nKBFB Urban Contemporary 18-34\nKZMJ Urban Contemporary 25-54\nBaltimore 23\nWERQ Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWOLB News/Talk 35-64\nWWIN-FM Urban AC 25-54\nWWIN-AM Gospel 35-64\nWLIF-HD2 Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nCharlotte 21\nWPZS Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nWOSF Urban AC / Old School 25-54\nWOSF-HD2 Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWBT AM/FM News Talk 25-54\nWFNZ Sports Talk 25-54\nWLNK Hot Adult Contemporary 25-54\nCincinnati 33\nWIZF Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWOSL Urban AC / Old School 25-54\nWDBZ-AM Talk 35-64\nWIZF-HD3 Hispanic 25-54\nCleveland 35\nWENZ Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWERE-AM News/Talk 35-64\nWJMO-AM Contemporary Inspirational 35-64\nWZAK Urban AC 25-54\nWENZ-HD2 Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\n9\nTable of Contents\nColumbus 36\nWCKX/WHTD Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWXMG Urban AC 25-54\nWJYD Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nWWLG Hispanic 25-54\nWQMC-TV Television 25-54\nRaleigh 37\nWFXC/WFXK Urban AC 25-54\nWQOK Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWNNL Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nIndianapolis 38\nWTLC-FM Urban AC 25-54\nWHHH Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWTLC-AM Contemporary Inspirational 35-64\nWIBC News Talk 25-54\nWHHH-HD2/HD3 Regional Mexican 25-54\nWLHK Country 25-54\nWIBC-HD2 Sports Talk 25-54\nWYXB Adult Contemporary 25-54\nWDNI-TV Television 25-54\nRichmond 53\nWKJS/WKJM Urban AC 25-54\nWCDX Urban Contemporary 18-34\nWPZZ Contemporary Inspirational 25-54\nWXGI-AM/WTPS-AM Classic Hip Hop 25-54\nAC-refers to Adult Contemporary\nOld School - refers to Old School Hip/Hop\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 31.2% of our net revenue was generated from the sale of advertising in our core radio business, excluding Reach Media. We\nconsider our radio broadcasting segment to be our core radio business. Within our core radio business, seven (Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Cleveland, Houston, Indianapolis, and\nWashington, DC) of the 13 markets in which we operated radio stations throughout 2023 or a portion thereof accounted for approximately 76.6% of our radio station net revenue for\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue from the operations of Reach Media, along with revenue from the seven significant contributing radio markets, accounted for approximately\n36.1% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Adverse events or conditions (economic, including government cutbacks or otherwise) could lead to\ndeclines in the contribution of Reach Media or declines in one or more of the seven significant contributing radio markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall\nfinancial performance and results of operations.\n10\nTable of Contents\nRadio Advertising Revenue\nSubstantially all net revenue generated from our radio franchise is generated from the sale of local, national and network advertising. Local sales are made by the sales staff located in\nour markets. National sales are made primarily by Katz Communications, Inc. (“Katz”), a firm specializing in radio advertising sales on the national level. Katz is paid agency\ncommissions on the advertising sold. Approximately 57.5% of our net revenue from our core radio business for the year ended December 31, 2023, was generated from the sale of local\nadvertising and 34.9% from sales to national advertisers, including network/syndication advertising. The balance of net revenue from our radio segment is primarily derived from ticket\nsales, and revenue related to sponsored events, management fees and other alternative revenue.\nAdvertising rates charged by radio stations are based primarily on:\n● a radio station’s audience share within the demographic groups targeted by the advertisers;\n● the number of radio stations in the market competing for the same demographic groups; and\n● the supply and demand for radio advertising time.\nA radio station’s listenership is measured by the Portable People MeterTM (the “PPMTM”) system or diary ratings surveys, both of which estimate the number of listeners tuned to a\nradio station and the time they spend listening to that radio station. Ratings are used by advertisers to evaluate whether to advertise on our radio stations, and are used by us to chart\naudience size, set advertising rates and adjust programming. Advertising rates are generally highest during the morning and afternoon commuting hours.\nCable Television, Reach Media and Digital Segments, Strategy and Sources of Revenue and Income\nAs a diversified media company, our operations include media forms that are complementary to our radio business. In a strategy similar to our radio market segmentation, we have\nmultiple complementary media and online brands. Each of these brands focuses on a different segment of African-American consumers. With our multiple brands, we are able to direct\nadvertisers to specific audiences within the urban communities in which we are located, or to bundle the brands for advertising sales purposes when advantageous.\nTV One, our primary cable television franchise targeting the African-American and urban communities, derives its revenue from advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising\nrevenue is derived from the sale of television airtime to advertisers and is recognized when the advertisements are run. TV One also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of\nvarious affiliation agreements generally based upon a per subscriber royalty for the right to distribute the Company’s programming under the terms of the distribution contracts. Our other\ncable television franchise, CLEO TV, is a lifestyle and entertainment network targeting Millennial and Gen X women of color that is also operated by TV One, LLC. CLEO TV derives\nits revenue principally from advertising.\nReach Media, our syndicated radio unit, primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Rickey Smiley\nMorning Show, Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell Show and the DL Hughley Show. In addition to being broadcast on 50 Urban One stations, our syndicated radio programming\nalso was available on 224 non-Urban One stations throughout the United States as of December 31, 2023.\nWe have launched websites that simultaneously stream radio station content for each of our radio stations, and we derive revenue from the sale of advertisements on those websites.\nWe generally encourage our web advertisers to run simultaneous radio campaigns and use mentions in our radio airtime to promote our websites. By providing streaming, we have been\nable to broaden our listener reach, particularly to “office hour” listeners, including at home “office hour” listeners. We believe streaming has had a positive impact on our radio stations’\nreach to listeners. In addition, our station websites link to our other online properties operated by our primary digital unit, Interactive One. Interactive One operates the largest social\nnetworking site primarily targeting African-Americans and other branded websites, including Bossip, HipHopWired and MadameNoire. Interactive One derives revenue from advertising\nservices on non-radio station branded\n11\nTable of Contents\nwebsites, and studio services where Interactive One provides services to other publishers. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. Advertising\nrevenue is recognized as impressions (the number of times advertisements appear in viewed pages) are delivered.\nFinally, we have made other investments in the entertainment industry, such as our past investment in MGM National Harbor, a casino operation in Prince George’s County,\nMaryland. Our MGM Investment entitled us to an annual cash distribution based on net gaming revenue from gaming activities conducted on the site of the facility. In March 2023, the\nCompany exercised the put option available to it and received approximately $136.8 million at the time of settlement of the put option in April 2023. Future opportunities could include\ninvestments in, acquisitions of, or the development of companies in diverse media businesses, gaming and entertainment, music production and distribution, movie distribution, internet-\nbased services, and distribution of our content through emerging distribution systems such as the Internet, smartphones, cellular phones, tablets, and the home entertainment market.\nCompetition\nThe media industry is highly competitive and we face intense competition across our core radio franchise and all of our complementary media properties and investments. Our media\nproperties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and with other media such as broadcast and cable television, the Internet, satellite radio, newspapers,\nmagazines, direct mail and outdoor advertising, some of which may be owned or controlled by horizontally-integrated companies. Audience ratings and advertising revenue are subject to\nchange and any adverse change in a market could adversely affect our net revenue in that market. If a competing radio station converts to a format similar to that of one of our radio\nstations, or if one of our competitors strengthens its signal or operations, our stations could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue. Other media companies which are larger\nand have more resources may also enter or increase their presence in markets or segments in which we operate. Although we believe our media properties are well positioned to compete,\nwe cannot assure you that our properties will maintain or increase their current ratings, market share or advertising revenue.\nProviding content across various platforms is a highly competitive business. Our digital and cable television segments compete for the time and attention of internet users and\nviewers and, thus, advertisers and advertising revenues with a wide range of internet companies such as AmazonTM, NetflixTM, Yahoo!TM, GoogleTM, and MicrosoftTM, with social\nnetworking sites such as FacebookTM and TikTokTM and with traditional media companies, which are increasingly offering their own digital products and services both organically and\nthrough acquisition. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of content, sale of commercial time on our digital and cable television\nnetworks and viewership. There is competition from other digital companies, production studios and other television networks for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as\nwriters, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of\nadvertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and\naudience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.\nOur TV One and CLEO TV cable television networks compete with other networks and platforms for the acquisition and distribution of content and for fees charged to cable\ntelevision operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our\naudiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed,\nconsolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and\nmaintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the\nproduction, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of\nnetworks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.\nOur networks and digital products compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences\nand the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of\n12\nTable of Contents\neach network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings/algorithms as determined by third-party research companies\nor search engines, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.\nFederal Antitrust Laws\nThe agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) or the Department of Justice, may investigate certain acquisitions. We\ncannot predict the outcome of any specific FTC or Department of Justice investigation. Any decision by the FTC or the Department of Justice to challenge a proposed acquisition could\naffect our ability to consummate the acquisition or to consummate it on the proposed terms. For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust\nImprovements Act of 1976 requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms concerning antitrust issues with the FTC and the Department of Justice and to observe specified\nwaiting period requirements before consummating the acquisition.\nFederal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting\nThe radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing regulation by the FCC and other federal agencies of ownership, programming, technical operations, employment\nand other business practices. The FCC regulates radio broadcast stations pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The Communications\nAct permits the operation of radio broadcast stations only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest,\nconvenience and necessity. Among other things, the FCC:\n● assigns frequency bands for radio broadcasting;\n● determines the particular frequencies, locations, operating power, interference standards, and other technical parameters for radio broadcast stations;\n● issues, renews, revokes and modifies radio broadcast station licenses;\n● imposes annual regulatory fees and application processing fees to recover its administrative costs;\n● establishes technical requirements for certain transmitting equipment to restrict harmful emissions;\n● adopts and implements regulations and policies that affect the ownership, operation, program content, employment, and business practices of radio broadcast stations; and\n● has the power to impose penalties, including monetary forfeitures, for violations of its rules and the Communications Act.\nThe Communications Act prohibits the assignment of an FCC license, or the transfer of control of an FCC licensee, without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to\ngrant or renew a radio broadcast license or consent to the assignment or transfer of control of a license, the FCC considers a number of factors, including restrictions on foreign\nownership, compliance with FCC media ownership limits and other FCC rules, the character and other qualifications of the licensee (or proposed licensee) and compliance with the Anti-\nDrug Abuse Act of 1988. A licensee’s failure to comply with the requirements of the Communications Act or FCC rules and policies may result in the imposition of sanctions, including\nadmonishment, fines, the grant of a license renewal for less than a full eight-year term or with conditions, denial of a license renewal application, the revocation of an FCC license, and/or\ndisqualification from acquiring additional broadcast properties.\nCongress, the FCC and, in some cases, other federal agencies and local jurisdictions are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies that\ncould affect the operation, ownership and profitability of\n13\nTable of Contents\nour radio stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenue for our radio broadcast stations or affect our ability to acquire additional radio broadcast stations or finance\nsuch acquisitions. Such matters include or may include:\n● changes to the license authorization and renewal process;\n● proposals to increase record keeping, including enhanced disclosure of stations’ efforts to serve the public interest;\n● proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees;\n● changes to rules relating to political broadcasting, including proposals to grant free airtime to candidates, and other changes regarding political and non-political program\ncontent, political advertising rates and sponsorship disclosures;\n● revised rules and policies regarding the regulation of the broadcast of indecent content;\n● proposals to increase the actions stations must take to demonstrate service to their local communities;\n● technical and frequency allocation matters;\n● changes in broadcast multiple ownership, foreign ownership, cross-ownership and ownership attribution rules and policies;\n● service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters;\n● legislation that would provide for the payment of sound recording royalties to artists, musicians or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations; and\n● changes to tax laws affecting broadcast operations and acquisitions.\nThe FCC also has adopted procedures for the auction of broadcast spectrum in circumstances where two or more parties have filed mutually exclusive applications for authority to\nconstruct new stations or certain major changes in existing stations. Such procedures may limit our efforts to modify or expand the broadcast signals of our stations.\nWe cannot predict what changes, if any, might be adopted or considered in the future, or what impact, if any, the implementation of any particular proposals or changes might have on\nour business.\nFCC License Grants and Renewals. In making licensing determinations, the FCC considers an applicant’s legal, technical, character and other qualifications. The FCC grants radio\nbroadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may renew them for additional terms. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its\nlicense if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. Under the Communications Act, radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years.\nGenerally, the FCC renews radio broadcast licenses without a hearing upon a finding that:\n● the radio station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity;\n● there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations; and\n14\nTable of Contents\n● there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC rules and regulations which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse.\nAfter considering these factors and any petitions to deny or informal objections against a license renewal application (which may lead to a hearing), the FCC may grant the license\nrenewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. Historically, our licenses have been renewed for full eight-year\nterms without any conditions or sanctions; however, there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of our stations will be renewed for a full term without conditions or sanctions.\nTypes of FCC Broadcast Licenses. The FCC classifies each AM and FM radio station. An AM radio station operates on either a clear channel, regional channel or local channel. A\nclear channel serves wide areas, particularly at night. A regional channel serves primarily a principal population center and the contiguous rural areas. A local channel serves primarily a\ncommunity and the suburban and rural areas immediately contiguous to it. AM radio stations are designated as Class A, Class B, Class C or Class D. Class A, B and C stations each\noperate unlimited time. Class A radio stations render primary and secondary service over an extended area. Class B stations render service only over a primary service area. Class C\nstations render service only over a primary service area that may be reduced as a consequence of interference. Class D stations operate either during daytime hours only, during limited\ntimes only, or unlimited time with low nighttime power.\nFM class designations depend upon the geographic zone in which the transmitter of the FM radio station is located. The minimum and maximum facilities requirements for an FM\nradio station are determined by its class. In general, commercial FM radio stations are classified as follows, in order of increasing power and antenna height: Class A, B1, C3, B, C2, C1,\nC0 and C. The FCC has adopted a rule subjecting Class C FM stations that do not satisfy a certain antenna height requirement to an involuntary downgrade in class to Class C0 under\ncertain circumstances.\nUrban One’s Licenses. The following table sets forth information with respect to each of our radio stations for which we held the license as of December 31, 2023. Stations which we\ndid not own as of December 31, 2023, but operated under an LMA, are not reflected on this table. A broadcast station’s market may be different from its community of license. The\ncoverage of an AM radio station is chiefly a function of the power of the radio station’s transmitter, less dissipative power losses and any directional antenna adjustments. For FM radio\nstations, signal coverage area is chiefly a function of the radio station’s ERP and the HAAT of the radio station’s antenna. “ERP” refers to the effective radiated power of an FM radio\nstation. “HAAT” refers to the height above average terrain of an FM radio station antenna. The table below excludes HD Radio multicast streams and LPTV stations.\n15\nTable of Contents\nYear of FCC Power HAAT in Broadcasting License\nMarket Station Call Letters Acquisition Class Kilowatts Meters Frequency Expiration Date\nAtlanta WUMJ-FM 1999 C3 8.5 165 97.5 MHz 4/1/2028\nWAMJ-FM 1999 C2 33 185 107.5 MHz 4/1/2028\nWHTA-FM 2002 C2 35 177 107.9 MHz 4/1/2028\nWPZE-FM 1999 A 3 143 102.5 MHz 4/1/2028\nWashington, DC WOL-AM 1980 C 0.37 N/A 1450 kHz 10/1/2027\nWMMJ-FM 1987 A 2.9 146 102.3 MHz 10/1/2027\nWKYS-FM 1995 B 24.5 215 93.9 MHz 10/1/2027\nWPRS-FM 2008 B 20.0 244 104.1 MHz 10/1/2027\nWYCB-AM 1998 C 1.0 N/A 1340 kHz 10/1/2027\nWDCJ-FM 2017 A 2.2 169 92.7 MHz 10/1/2027\nPhiladelphia WRNB-FM 2000 B 12.5 302.0 100.3 MHz 8/1/2030\nWPPZ-FM 2004 A 0.8 276.0 107.9 MHz 6/1/2030\nHouston KMJQ-FM 2000 C 100 524 102.1 MHz 8/1/2029\nKKBQ-FM 2023 C 100 585 92.9 MHz 8/1/2029\nKBXX-FM 2000 C 100 585 97.9 MHz 8/1/2029\nKHPT-FM 2023 C 100 579 106.9 MHz 8/1/2029\nKGLK-FM 2023 C 98 601 107.5 MHz 8/1/2029\nDallas KBFB-FM 2000 C 100 574 97.9 MHz 8/1/2029\nKZMJ-FM 2001 C 100 591 94.5 MHz 8/1/2029\nBaltimore WWIN-AM 1992 C 0.5 N/A 1400 kHz 10/1/2027\nWWIN-FM 1992 A 3 91 95.9 MHz 10/1/2027\nWOLB-AM 1993 D 0.25 N/A 1010 kHz 10/1/2027\nWERQ-FM 1993 B 37 173 92.3 MHz 10/1/2027\nCharlotte WFNZ-FM 2000 C3 10.5 154 92.7 MHz 12/1/2027\nWPZS-FM 2004 A 6 94 100.9 MHz 12/1/2027\nWOSF-FM 2014 C1 51 395 105.3 MHz 12/1/2027\nWBT-FM 2021 C3 7.7 182 99.3 MHz 12/1/2027\nWBT-AM 2021 A 50 N/A 1110 kHz 12/1/2027\nWFNZ-AM 2021 B 5 N/A 610 kHz 12/1/2027\nWLNK-FM 2021 C 100 516 107.9 MHz 12/1/2027\nCleveland WJMO-AM 1999 B 5 N/A 1300 kHz 10/1/2028\nWENZ-FM 1999 B 16 272 107.9 MHz 10/1/2028\nWZAK-FM 2000 B 27.5 189 93.1 MHz 10/1/2028\nWERE-AM 2000 C 1 N/A 1490 kHz 10/1/2028\nRaleigh-Durham WQOK-FM 2000 C2 50 146 97.5 MHz 12/1/2027\nWFXK-FM 2000 C1 100 299 104.3 MHz 12/1/2027\nWFXC-FM 2000 C3 13 141 107.1 MHz 12/1/2027\nWNNL-FM 2000 C3 7.9 176 103.9 MHz 12/1/2027\nRichmond WPZZ-FM 1999 C1 100 299 104.7 MHz 10/1/2027\nWCDX-FM 2001 B1 4.5 235 92.1 MHz 10/1/2027\nWKJM-FM 2001 A 6 100 99.3 MHz 10/1/2027\nWKJS-FM 2001 A 2.3 162 105.7 MHz 10/1/2027\nWTPS-AM 2001 C 1 N/A 1240 kHz 10/1/2027\nWXGI-AM 2017 D 3.9 N/A 950 kHz 10/1/2027\nColumbus WCKX-FM 2001 A 1.9 126 107.5 MHz 10/1/2028\nWHTD-FM 2001 A 6 99 106.3 MHz 10/1/2028\nWXMG-FM 2016 B 21 232 95.5 MHz 10/1/2028\nWJYD-FM 2016 A 6 100 107.1 MHz 10/1/2028\nIndianapolis WTLC-FM 2000 A 6 99 106.7 MHz 8/1/2028\nWHHH-FM 2000 A 6 100 100.9 MHz 8/1/2028\nWTLC-AM 2001 B 5 N/A 1310 kHz 8/1/2028\nWIBC-FM 2022 B 13.5 302 93.1 MHz 8/1/2028\nWYXB-FM 2022 B 50 150 105.7 MHz 8/1/2028\nWLHK-FM 2022 B 23 223 97.1 MHz 8/1/2028\nCincinnati WIZF-FM 2001 A 2.5 155 101.1 MHz 8/1/2028\nWDBZ-AM 2007 C 1 N/A 1230 kHz 10/1/2028\nWOSL-FM 2006 A 3.1 141 100.3 MHz 10/1/2028\n16\nTable of Contents\nTo obtain the FCC’s prior consent to assign or transfer control of a broadcast license, an appropriate application must be filed with the FCC. If the assignment or transfer involves a\nsubstantial change in ownership or control of the licensee, for example, the transfer of more than 50% of the voting stock, the applicant must give public notice and the application is\nsubject to a 30-day period for public comment. During this time, interested parties may file petitions with the FCC to deny the application. Informal objections may be filed at any time\nuntil the FCC acts upon the application. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application, administrative procedures provide for petitions seeking reconsideration or full FCC\nreview of the grant. The Communications Act also permits the appeal of a contested grant to a federal court.\nUnder the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any person who is not a U.S. citizen or by any entity that has more than 20% of its capital stock\nowned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, or by foreign governments or their representatives. The Communications Act prohibits more than 25% indirect\nforeign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by such prohibition. The FCC has interpreted this provision\nof the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before this 25% limit may be exceeded. Since we serve as a holding company for subsidiaries that serve as\nlicensees for our stations, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by non-U.S. citizens or their representatives,\nforeign governments, representatives of foreign governments, or foreign business entities unless we seek and obtain FCC authority to exceed that level. The FCC will entertain and\nauthorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in\nbroadcast licensees.\nThe FCC applies its media ownership limits to “attributable” interests. The interests of officers, directors and those who directly or indirectly hold five percent or more of the total\noutstanding voting stock of a corporation that holds a broadcast license (or a corporate parent) are generally deemed attributable interests, as are any limited partnership or limited liability\ncompany interests that are not properly “insulated” from management activities. Certain passive investors that hold stock for investment purposes only are deemed attributable with the\nownership of 20% or more of the voting stock of a licensee or parent corporation. An entity with one or more radio stations in a market that enters into a LMA or a TBA with another\nradio station in the same market obtains an attributable interest in the brokered radio station if the brokering station supplies programming for more than 15% of the brokered radio\nstation’s weekly broadcast hours. Similarly, a radio station owner’s right under a joint sales agreement (“JSA”) to sell more than 15% per week of the advertising time on another radio\nstation in the same market constitutes an attributable ownership interest in such station for purposes of the FCC’s ownership rules. Debt instruments, non-voting stock, unexercised\noptions and warrants, minority voting interests in corporations having a single majority shareholder, and limited partnership or limited liability company membership interests where the\ninterest holder is not “materially involved” in the media-related activities of the partnership or limited liability company pursuant to FCC-prescribed “insulation” provisions, generally do\nnot subject their holders to attribution unless such interests implicate the FCC’s equity-debt-plus (or “EDP”) rule. Under the EDP rule, a major programming supplier or the holder of an\nattributable interest in a same-market radio station will have an attributable interest in a station if the supplier or same-market media entity also holds debt or equity, or both, in the station\nthat is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. For purposes of the EDP rule, equity includes all stock, whether voting or nonvoting, and interests held by\nlimited partners or limited liability company members that are “insulated” from material involvement in the company’s media activities. A major programming supplier is any supplier\nthat provides more than 15% of the station’s weekly programming hours.\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules generally restrict ownership, operation or control of, or the common holding of attributable interests in, radio broadcast stations serving the\nsame local market in excess of specified numerical limits.\nThe numerical limits on radio stations that one entity may own in a local market are as follows:\n● in a radio market with 45 or more commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which\nare in the same service (AM or FM);\n● in a radio market with 30 to 44 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are\nin the same service (AM or FM);\n17\nTable of Contents\n● in a radio market with 15 to 29 commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to six commercial radio stations, not more than four of which are in\nthe same service (AM or FM); and\n● in a radio market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations, a party may hold an attributable interest in up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which\nare in the same service (AM or FM), except that a party may not hold an attributable interest in more than 50% of the radio stations in such market.\nTo apply these tiers, the FCC currently relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist. In other areas, the FCC relies on a contour-overlap methodology. The market\ndefinition used by the FCC in applying its ownership rules may not be the same as that used for purposes of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In 2003, when the FCC changed its methodology\nfor defining local radio markets, it grandfathered existing combinations of radio stations that would not comply with the modified rules. The FCC’s rules provide that these grandfathered\ncombinations may not be sold intact except to certain “eligible entities,” which the FCC defines as entities qualifying as a small business consistent with Small Business Administration\nstandards.\nThe media ownership rules are subject to review by the FCC every four years. In December 2023, the FCC issued an order concluding its 2018 quadrennial review, which retained\nthe local radio ownership rule without significant changes. This order is subject to appeal, and in addition, the FCC’s 2022 quadrennial review of its media ownership rules is currently\npending.\nThe attribution and media ownership rules limit the number of radio stations we may acquire or own in any particular market and may limit the prospective buyers of any stations we\nwant to sell. The FCC’s rules could affect our business in a number of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:\n● the FCC’s radio ownership limits could have an adverse effect on our ability to accumulate stations in a given area or to sell a group of stations in a local market to a single\nentity;\n● restricting the assignment and transfer of control of “grandfathered” radio combinations that exceed the ownership limits as a result of the FCC’s 2003 change in local\nmarket definition could adversely affect our ability to buy or sell a group of stations in a local market from or to a single entity; and\n● in general terms, future changes in the way the FCC defines radio markets or in the numerical station caps could limit our ability to acquire new stations in certain markets,\nour ability to operate stations pursuant to certain agreements, and our ability to improve the coverage contours of our existing stations.\nProgramming and Operations. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the “public interest” by presenting programming that responds to community problems, needs\nand interests and by maintaining records demonstrating such responsiveness. The FCC considers complaints from viewers or listeners about a broadcast station’s programming. All radio\nstations are now required to maintain their public inspection files on a publicly accessible FCC-hosted online database. Moreover, the FCC has from time-to-time proposed rules designed\nto increase local programming content and diversity, including renewal application processing guidelines for locally-oriented programming and a requirement that broadcasters establish\nadvisory boards in the communities where they own stations. Stations also must follow FCC rules and policies regulating political advertising, obscene or indecent programming,\nsponsorship identification, contests and lotteries and technical operation, including limits on human exposure to radio frequency radiation.\nThe FCC requires that licensees not discriminate in hiring practices on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. It also requires stations with at least five full-time\nemployees to broadly disseminate information about all full-time job openings and undertake outreach initiatives from an FCC list of activities such as participation in job fairs,\ninternships, or scholarship programs. The FCC is considering whether to apply these recruitment requirements to part-time employment positions. Stations must retain records of their\noutreach efforts and keep an annual Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) report in their public inspection files and post an electronic version on their websites.\n18\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, complaints may be filed against any of our radio stations alleging violations of these or other rules. In addition, the FCC may conduct audits or inspections to\nensure and verify licensee compliance with FCC rules and regulations. Failure to observe these or other rules and regulations can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including\nfines or conditions, the grant of “short” (less than the maximum eight year) renewal terms or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the\nrevocation of a license.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 948 full-time employees and 450 part-time employees. Our employees are not unionized.\nWe believe that our success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and\nbonuses, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and offer an employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health\ncare, retirement planning and paid time off.\nAs a business founded by an African-American woman, diversity and inclusion is engrained in our corporate history. Our Board of Directors is diverse; Catherine L. Hughes, our\nFounder and Chairperson, is an African-American woman, and four of our six directors are minorities. Our President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), who is also a director, Alfred\nC. Liggins, III is an African-American male, as is our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Kristopher Simpson. Further, Karen Wishart, our Executive Vice President and Chief\nAdministrative Officer, is an African-American woman, as is Michelle Rice, President of TV One. As of December 31, 2023, 74% of our employees were racially diverse, and 46% of\nour employees were women. We are proud that our organization is governed and propelled by such a diverse group of individuals, which we believe contributes to our Company’s success\nnow, and in the long-term.\nOur senior leadership team has introduced various initiatives to ensure that our Company remains inclusive and supportive for all, including: (i) conducting workplace training, which\nincludes focuses on unconscious bias, discrimination and harassment; (ii) leveraging a diverse slate of candidates for all job vacancies, including senior leadership; and (iii) developing\ncontent across our multi-media platform that elevates the voice of minority communities to foster equality and inclusion in both the entertainment industry and across the nation.\nEnvironmental\nAs the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with\nthese laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance, however, that compliance with existing or new environmental laws and\nregulations will not require us to make significant expenditures in the future.\nSeasonality\nSeasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures. Typically, revenues are lowest in the\nfirst calendar quarter of the year. Due to this seasonality and certain other factors, the results of interim periods may not necessarily be indicative of results for the full year. In addition,\nour operations are impacted by political cycles and generally experience higher revenues in congressional and presidential election years. This seasonality and similar recurring\nfluctuation may affect comparability between years.\nCorporate Governance\nCode of Ethics.

RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIn an enterprise as large and complex as ours, a wide range of factors could affect our business and financial results. The factors described below are considered to be the most\nsignificant but are not listed in any particular order. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have\nmaterial adverse effects on our future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results\nor trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and\nResults of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial\nstatements.\nAs discussed in Part II, Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” of this Form 10-K, management has concluded that our internal controls related to certain business processes and\ndisclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 due to the identified material weaknesses.\nIn addition, as discussed in Note 2 – Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, during the preparation of the\ninterim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period as of March 31, 2023, management and our Audit Committee, after discussion with our independent registered public\naccounting firm, concluded that identified misstatements in our accounting for stock-based compensation and the Company’s investment in the operation of RVA Entertainment Holdings,\nLLC, (“RVAEH”), and the related tax effects, were not material to its previously issued consolidated financial statements, however, the effect of correcting these adjustments in 2023\nwould materially misstate the Company’s unaudited financial statements for three months ended March 31, 2023. The understatement of stock-based compensation is related to the\nCompany’s material weakness over stock-based compensation. The Company’s misstatement relating to the accounting change in RVAEH is related to our material weakness in internal\ncontrol over financial reporting over investments in RVAEH. In addition to the adjustments related to the stock-based compensation and RVAEH, the Company also included corrections\nfor other immaterial adjustments impacting trade accounts receivable, net, accounts payable, other long-term liabilities, and accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets and\nselling, general and administrative expenses, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, and related tax effect in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange\nAct. Management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in\ninternal\n20\nTable of Contents\ncontrol over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – An Integrated Framework (“COSO”). We are actively engaged in remediation efforts designed\nto address these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our\ninternal control are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nThe material weaknesses, or a failure to promptly remediate them, may adversely affect our business, our reputation, our results of operations and the market price of our common\nstock. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, our investors, customers and other business partners may lose confidence in our business or our financial\nreports, and our access to capital markets may be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial\nstatements within the time periods specified by the rules and regulations of the SEC and other regulatory authorities, could be adversely affected, which may result in violations of\napplicable securities laws, stock exchange listing requirements and the covenants under our debt agreements. We could also be exposed to lawsuits, investigations, or other legal actions.\nIn such actions, a governmental authority may interpret a law, regulation or accounting principle differently than we have, exposing us to different or additional risks. We could incur\nsignificant costs in connection with these actions. We have not accrued for any such liabilities.\nThe control deficiencies resulting in the material weaknesses, in the aggregate, if not effectively remediated could also result in misstatements of accounts or disclosures that would\nresult in a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will not\nidentify additional control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. If we identify future control deficiencies or material weaknesses, these may lead to adverse effects on our\nbusiness, our reputation, our results of operations, and the market price of our common stock.\nWe face risks related to the revision of our previously issued consolidated financial statements with respect to December 31, 2023 and 2022 (the “Affected Periods”).\nAs discussed in Note 2 – Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K, we reached a determination to revise certain\nfinancial information and related footnote disclosures in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the Affected Periods. As a result, we have become subject to a\nnumber of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. We\nexpect to continue to face many of the risks and challenges related to the revision, including the following:\n● we may face potential for litigation or other disputes, which may include, among others, claims invoking the federal and state securities laws, contractual claims or other\nclaims arising from the revision; and\n● the processes undertaken to effect the revision may not have been adequate to identify and correct all errors in our historical financial statements and, as a result, we may\ndiscover additional errors and our financial statements remain subject to the risk of future revision or restatement.\nWe cannot assure that all of the risks and challenges described above will be eliminated or that general reputational harm will not persist. If one or more of the foregoing risks or\nchallenges persist, our business, operations and financial condition are likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nThe revision of our previously issued financial statements and ongoing remediation of material weaknesses have been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to\nadditional risks that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the revision of our previously issued financial statements and\nthe ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our\n21\nTable of Contents\ninternal control over financial reporting. We have implemented and will continue to implement additional processes utilizing existing resources and adding new resources as needed. To\nthe extent these steps are not successful, we could be forced to incur additional time and expense. Our management’s attention has also been diverted from the operation of our business in\nconnection with the revision and ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nThe delayed filings of our 2022 and 2023 annual reports and our first quarter 2024 quarterly report have made us currently ineligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to\nregister the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nAs a result of the delayed filings of our 2022 and 2023 annual reports and our first quarter 2024 quarterly report with the SEC, we will not be eligible to register the offer and sale of\nour securities using a short form registration statement on Form S-3 until one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. Should we wish to register the offer and\nsale of our securities to the public prior to the time we are eligible to use a short form registration statement on Form S-3, both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to\ncomplete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to timely execute any such transaction successfully and potentially harming our financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Nature and Operations of Our Business\nOur results may be impacted by economic trends.\nOur results of operations could be negatively impacted by economic fluctuations or future economic downturns. Advertising expenditures by our clients tend to be cyclical, reflecting\noverall economic conditions. The risks associated with our business could be more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in\nadvertising expenditures. A decrease in advertising expenditures could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe state and condition of the global financial markets and fluctuations in the global and U.S. economies may have an unpredictable impact on our business and financial\ncondition.\nFrom time to time, including as a result of inflation, bank failures, changes in interest rates, recession or the COVID-19 pandemic public health crisis, the global equity and credit\nmarkets experience high levels of volatility and disruption. At various points in time, the markets have produced upward and/or downward pressure on stock prices and limited credit\ncapacity for certain companies without regard to those companies’ underlying financial strength. In addition, advertising is a discretionary and variable business expense which may be\nreduced as companies contend with lower revenues or higher expenses, including higher costs of capital. Spending on advertising tends to decline disproportionately during an economic\nrecession or downturn as compared to other types of business spending. Consequently, a downturn in the United States economy generally has an adverse effect on our advertising\nrevenue and, therefore, our results of operations. A recession or downturn in the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market in which we operate, also may\nhave a significant effect on us. Radio revenues in the markets in which we operate may also face greater challenges than the U.S. economy generally and may remain so. Radio revenues\nin certain markets in which we operate have lagged the growth of the general United States economy as audiences have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.\nInflation has the potential to adversely affect our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable\nto achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher interest rates\nand capital costs, increased costs of labor, weakening exchange rates and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, cost\nincreases. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity\ncould be materially adversely affected.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable. This risk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions.\nOur outstanding accounts receivable are not covered by collateral or credit insurance. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on our receivables, this\nrisk is heightened during periods of uncertain economic conditions and there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk. Such failures could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIncreases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing for consumer products may impact the demand for advertising.\nIn general, demand for certain consumer products may be adversely affected by increases in interest rates and the reduced availability of financing. Also, banks failures, loan defaults\nand/or other trends in the financial industry which influence the requirements used by lenders to evaluate potential consumers can result in reduced availability of financing. If interest\nrates or lending requirements increase and consequently, the ability of prospective consumers to finance purchases of products is adversely affected, the demand for advertising may also\nbe adversely impacted and the impact may be material. In addition, our borrowing costs could be impacted, and such cost changes could reduce the expected returns on certain of our\ncorporate development and other investment opportunities.\nThe terms of our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our direct and indirect subsidiaries may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to\nchanges in market conditions or to take some actions.\nOur debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur\nadditional indebtedness, issue preferred stock, incur liens, pay dividends, enter into asset purchase or sale transactions, merge or consolidate with another company, dispose of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets or make certain other payments or investments. These restrictions could limit our ability to grow our business through acquisitions and could limit our\nability to respond to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs.\nWe have historically incurred net losses which could resume in the future.\nWe have historically reported net losses in our consolidated statements of operations, due mostly in part to recording non-cash impairment charges for write-downs to radio\nbroadcasting licenses and goodwill, interest expenses (both cash and non-cash), and revenue declines caused by weakened advertising demand resulting from the current economic\nenvironment. These results have had a negative impact on our financial condition and could be exacerbated in a poor economic climate. If such items recur in the future, they could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur revenue is substantially dependent on spending and allocation decisions by advertisers, and seasonality and/or weakening economic conditions may have an impact upon our\nbusiness.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from sales of advertisements and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers. Any reduction in advertising expenditures or\nchanges in advertisers’ spending priorities and/or allocations across different types of media/platforms or programming could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and\nresults of operations. We do not obtain long-term commitments from our advertisers and advertisers may cancel, reduce, or postpone advertisements without penalty, which could\nadversely affect our revenue. Seasonal net revenue fluctuations are common in the media industries and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures by local and national\nadvertisers. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years tend to benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality (including\nthe weather), combined with the severe structural changes that have occurred in the U.S. economy, make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of\nany specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur success is dependent upon audience acceptance of our content, particularly our television and radio programs, which is difficult to predict.\nRadio, television, and digital content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of media content\nor a radio program, and the licensing of rights to the intellectual property associated with the content or program, depend primarily upon their acceptance and perceptions by the public,\nwhich can change quickly and are difficult to predict. The commercial success of content or a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs\nreleased into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions, and other tangible\nand intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Our failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content on any part of our multi-media platform could adversely affect our\nrevenues.\nRatings for broadcast stations and traffic on a particular website are also factors that are weighed when advertisers determine which outlets to use and in determining the advertising\nrates that the outlet receives. Poor ratings or traffic levels can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. For example, if there is an event causing a change of programming at\none of our stations, there could be no assurance that any replacement programming would generate the same level of ratings, revenues, or profitability as the previous programming. In\naddition, changes in ratings methodology, search engine algorithms and technology could adversely impact our businesses and negatively affect our advertising revenues.\nTelevision content production is inherently a risky business because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a television program and the licensing of rights to\nthe associated intellectual property depends primarily upon the public’s level of acceptance, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a television program also depends\nupon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs in the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities,\ngeneral economic conditions, and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the\nadvertising rates that TV One/CLEO TV receive. Poor ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenues. Consequently, low public acceptance of TV One/CLEO TV’s\ncontent may have an adverse effect on our cable television segment’s results of operations. Further, networks or programming launched by NetflixTM, Oprah Winfrey (OWNTM), Sean\nCombs (REVOLT TVTM), and Magic Johnson (ASPIRETM), could take away from our audience share and ratings and thus have an adverse effect on our cable television’s results of\noperations.\nIncreases in or new royalties, including through legislation, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently pay royalties to song composers and publishers through Broadcast Music, Inc (“BMI”), American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (“ASCAP”),\nSEASAC, Inc. (“SESAC”) and Global Music Rights Inc. (“GMR”) but not to record labels or recording artists for exhibition or use of over the air broadcasts of music. We must also pay\nroyalties to the copyright owners of sound recordings for the digital audio transmission of such sound recordings on the Internet. We pay such royalties under federal statutory licenses\nand pay applicable license fees to Sound Exchange, the non-profit organization designated by the United States Copyright Royalty Board to collect such license fees. The royalty rates\napplicable to sound recordings under federal statutory licenses are subject to adjustment. The royalty rates we pay to copyright owners for the public performance of musical\ncompositions on our radio stations and internet streams could increase as a result of private negotiations and the emergence of new performing rights organizations, which could adversely\nimpact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, from time to time, Congress considers legislation which could change the copyright fees and the\nprocedures by which the fees are determined. The legislation historically has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the broadcast industry and other parties affected by\nthe proposed legislation. It cannot be predicted whether any proposed future legislation will become law or what impact it would have on our results from operations, cash flows or\nfinancial position.\n24\nTable of Contents\nA disproportionate share of our radio segment revenue comes from a small number of geographic markets and our syndicated radio business, Reach Media.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 31.1% of our net revenue was generated from the sale of advertising in our core radio business, excluding Reach Media.\nWithin our core radio business, seven (Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, and Washington, DC) of the 13 markets in which we operated radio stations\nthroughout 2023 or a portion thereof accounted for approximately 77.0% of our radio station net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Revenue from the operations of Reach\nMedia, along with revenue from the seven significant contributing radio markets, accounted for approximately 36.2% of our total consolidated net revenue for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. Adverse events or conditions (economic, including government cutbacks or otherwise) could lead to declines in the contribution of Reach Media or declines in one or\nmore of the seven significant contributing radio markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall financial performance and results of operations.\nWe may lose audience share and advertising revenue to our competitors.\nOur media properties compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other radio stations and station groups and other media such as broadcast television, newspapers,\nmagazines, cable television, satellite television, satellite radio, outdoor advertising, “over the top providers” on the internet and direct mail. Adverse changes in audience ratings, internet\ntraffic, and market shares could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. Larger media companies, with more financial resources than we have may target our core audiences or\nenter the segments or markets in which we operate, causing competitive pressure. Further, other media and broadcast companies may change their programming format or engage in\naggressive promotional campaigns to compete directly with our media properties for our core audiences and advertisers. Competition for our core audiences in any of our segments or\nmarkets could result in lower ratings or traffic and, hence, lower advertising revenue for us, or cause us to increase promotion and other expenses and, consequently, lower our earnings\nand cash flow. Changes in population, demographics, audience tastes and other factors beyond our control, could also cause changes in audience ratings or market share.\nConsolidation among our competitors and other market participants has increased, and may continue to increase, also resulting in increased competitive pressures, such as limited\navailability of licensable content. Our competitors include companies with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, as well as companies in adjacent\nsectors with significant financial, marketing and other resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing. Such competitors could also have\npreferential access to content and important technologies, such as artificial intelligence (“AI”), customer data or other competitive information. Our competitors may also enter into\nbusiness combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.\nFailure by us to respond successfully to these changes could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain or\nincrease our current audience ratings and advertising revenue.\nWe must respond to the rapid changes in technology, content offerings, services, and standards across our entire platform in order to remain competitive.\nThe media entertainment and internet businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies. Technological standards across\nour media properties are evolving and new distribution technologies/platforms are emerging at a rapid pace. We cannot assure that we will have the resources to acquire new technologies\nor to introduce new features, content or services to compete with these new technologies. Our customers may require features and capabilities that we do not offer. A key basis on which\nwe compete with other companies is on adapting to technological change including the successful utilization of data analytics, AI and machine learning. Rules governing new\ntechnological developments, such as developments in generative AI, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue\nstreams for the use of our intellectual property and how we create our services and products.\nTechnological standards across our media properties are evolving and new distribution technologies/platforms are emerging at a rapid pace. We cannot assure that we will have the\nresources to acquire new technologies or to introduce\n25\nTable of Contents\nnew features, content or services to compete with these new technologies. New media has resulted in fragmentation in the advertising market, and we cannot predict the effect, if any, that\nadditional competition arising from new technologies or content offerings may have across any of our business segments or our financial condition and results of operations, which may\nbe adversely affected if we are not able to adapt successfully to these new media technologies or distribution platforms. The continuing growth and evolution of channels and platforms\nhas increased our challenges in differentiating ourselves from other media platforms. We continually seek to develop and enhance our content offerings and distribution\nplatforms/methodologies. Failure to effectively execute in these efforts, actions by our competitors, or other failures to deliver content effectively could hurt our ability to differentiate\nourselves from our competitors and, as a result, have adverse effects across our business.\nThe loss of key personnel, including certain on-air talent, could disrupt the management and operations of our business.\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executive officers and other key employees, including certain on-air personalities. We believe that the\ncombination of skills and experience possessed by our executive officers and other key employees could be difficult to replace, and that the loss of one or more of them could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us, including the impairment of our ability to execute our business strategy. In addition, several of our on-air personalities and syndicated radio programs hosts\nhave large loyal audiences in their respective broadcast areas and may be significantly responsible for the ratings of a station. The loss of such on-air personalities or any change in their\npopularity could impact the ability of the station to sell advertising and our ability to derive revenue from syndicating programs hosted by them. We cannot be assured that these\nindividuals will remain with us or will retain their current audiences or ratings.\nIf our digital segment does not continue to develop and offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services, our advertising revenues could be adversely affected.\nIn order to attract consumers and generate increased activity on our digital properties, we believe that we must offer compelling and differentiated content, products and services.\nHowever, acquiring, developing, and offering such content, products and services may require significant costs and time to develop, while consumer tastes may be difficult to predict and\nare subject to rapid change. If we are unable to provide content, products and services that are sufficiently attractive to our digital users, we may not be able to generate the increases in\nactivity necessary to generate increased advertising revenues. In addition, although we have access to certain content provided by our other businesses, we may be required to make\nsubstantial payments to license such content. Many of our content arrangements with third parties are non-exclusive, so competitors may be able to offer similar or identical content. If we\nare not able to acquire or develop compelling content and do so at reasonable prices, or if other companies offer content that is similar to that provided by our digital segment, we may not\nbe able to attract and increase the engagement of digital consumers on our digital properties.\nContinued growth in our digital business also depends on our ability to continue offering a competitive and distinctive range of advertising products and services for advertisers and\npublishers and our ability to maintain or increase prices for our advertising products and services. Continuing to develop and improve these products and services may require significant\ntime and costs. If we cannot continue to develop and improve our advertising products and services or if prices for our advertising products and services decrease, our digital advertising\nrevenues could be adversely affected. Finally, recently, our digital business has seen significant growth in its business due to advertisers increased interest in minority-controlled media\ngiven recent social justice/equality trends. Should these trends reverse or decline, revenues within our digital and other segments could be adversely impacted.\nUnrelated third parties may claim that we infringe on their rights based on the nature and content of information posted on websites we maintain.\nWe host internet services that enable individuals to exchange information, generate content, comment on our content, and engage in various online activities. The law relating to the\nliability of providers of these online services for activities of their users is currently unsettled both within the United States and internationally. While we monitor postings to such\nwebsites, claims may be brought against us for defamation, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories\nbased on the nature and content of information that may be\n26\nTable of Contents\nposted online or generated by our users. Our defense of such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources.\nIf we are unable to protect our domain names and/or content, our reputation and brands could be adversely affected.\nWe currently hold various domain name registrations relating to our brands, including urban1.com, radio-one.com and interactiveone.com. The registration and maintenance of\ndomain names are generally regulated by governmental agencies and their designees. Governing bodies may establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name\nregistrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may be unable to register or maintain relevant domain names. We may be unable, without significant\ncost or at all, to prevent third parties from registering domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\nFailure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our reputation and brands and make it more difficult for users to find our websites and our services. In addition, piracy of the\nCompany’s content, including digital piracy, may decrease revenue received from the exploitation of the Company’s programming and other content and adversely affect its businesses\nand profitability.\nFuture asset impairment to the carrying values of our FCC licenses and goodwill within the radio broadcasting segment could adversely impact our results of operations and net\nworth.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $375.3 million in broadcast licenses and $30.0 million in goodwill within the radio broadcasting segment, which totaled $405.3\nmillion and represented approximately 33.4% of our total assets. Therefore, we believe estimating the fair value of goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting\nestimate because of the significance of their carrying values in relation to our total assets.\nWe are required to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which we have traditionally done as of October 1 each year, or on an\ninterim basis when events or changes in circumstances suggest impairment may have occurred. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite-\nlived intangible asset over its fair value. Impairment may result from deterioration in our performance, changes in anticipated future cash flows, changes in business plans, adverse\neconomic or market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, or other factors beyond our control. The amount of any impairment must be expensed as a charge to\noperations. Fair values of FCC licenses have been estimated using the income approach, which incorporates several judgmental assumptions over a 10-year model including, but not\nlimited to, market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, operating profit margins, discount rate and terminal growth rate. Fair values of goodwill within\nthe radio broadcasting segment have been estimated using the income approach, which incorporates several judgmental assumptions over a 10-year model including, but not limited to,\nrevenue growth rates of each radio market, operating profit margins, discount rate and terminal growth rate. We also utilize a market-based approach to evaluate our fair value estimates.\nThere are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analysis.\nChanges in certain events or circumstances could result in changes to our estimated fair values and may result in further write-downs to the carrying values of these assets. Additional\nimpairment charges could adversely affect our financial results, financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nOur business depends on maintaining our licenses with the FCC. We could be prevented from operating a radio station if we fail to maintain its license.\nWithin our core radio business, we are required to maintain radio broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC. These licenses are ordinarily issued for a maximum term of eight years\nand are renewable. Currently, subject to renewal, our radio broadcasting licenses expire at various times beginning October 2027 through August 1, 2030. While we anticipate receiving\nrenewals of all of our broadcasting licenses, interested third parties may challenge our renewal applications. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a\ntimely filed license renewal application was filed and is pending, as is the case with respect to each of our stations with licenses that have expired. During the periods when a renewal\napplication is pending, informal objections and petitions to deny the renewal application can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public, on a variety of grounds. In\naddition, we are subject to extensive and\n27\nTable of Contents\nchanging regulation by the FCC with respect to such matters as programming, indecency standards, technical operations, employment and business practices. If we or any of our\nsignificant stockholders, officers, or directors violate the FCC’s rules and regulations or the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”), or is convicted of a\nfelony or found to have engaged in certain other types of non-FCC related misconduct, the FCC may commence a proceeding to impose fines or other sanctions upon us. Examples of\npossible sanctions include the imposition of fines, the renewal of one or more of our broadcasting licenses for a term of fewer than eight years or the revocation of our broadcast licenses.\nIf the FCC were to issue an order denying a license renewal application or revoking a license, we would be required to cease operating the radio station covered by the license only after\nwe had exhausted administrative and judicial review without success.\nDisruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise client information and expose us to liability, possibly\ncausing our business and reputation to suffer.\nThe use of our computers and digital technology in substantially all aspects of our business operations gives rise to cybersecurity risks. Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third\nparties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could\nresult in the loss or misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering\n(predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent in general. Our efforts to protect our company’s data or the information we receive may be\nunsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance; government surveillance; or other threats that evolve. In\naddition, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ data on a continual basis.\nAny internal technology breach, error or failure impacting systems hosted internally or externally, or any large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on,\nsuch as power, telecommunications or the Internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service\nand result in increased costs or reduced revenues. Our technology systems and related data also may be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control,\nincluding natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. Our technology security initiatives, disaster recovery plans\nand other measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our reputation.\nIn addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we may collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our clients, listeners and employees. The secure\noperation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Any compromise of our\ntechnology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to clients’,\nlisteners’, employees’ or business partners’ information. Any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties\nunder laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. Although we\nhave developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such\nmeasures will provide absolute security.\nIn the event of a technical or cyber event, we could experience a significant, unplanned disruption, or substantial and extensive degradation of our services, or our network may fail in\nthe future. Despite our significant infrastructure investments, we may have insufficient communications and server capacity to address these or other disruptions, which could result in\ninterruptions in our services. Any widespread interruption or substantial and extensive degradation in the functioning of our IT or technical platform for any reason could negatively\nimpact our revenue and could harm our business and results of operations. If such a widespread interruption occurred, or if we failed to deliver content to users as expected, our reputation\ncould be damaged severely. Moreover, any disruptions, significant degradation, cybersecurity threats, security breaches, or attacks on our internal information technology systems could\nimpact our ratings and cause us to lose listeners, users or viewers or make it more difficult to attract new ones, either of which could harm our business and results of operations.\n28\nTable of Contents\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophic events.\nAny economic failure or other material disruption caused by war, climate change or natural disasters, including fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes; power loss or\nshortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. If such\ndisruptions contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on information technology, or impair our ability to meet our customer demands, our operating\nresults and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThere is also an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. In addition to physical risks, climate change risk includes\nlonger-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or\nthird parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility.\nOur entry into new lines of business may not succeed and may result in increased shareholder value.\nWe have historically operated as an urban-oriented, multi-media company that primarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Over the years we have invested in other\nventures such as gaming. Entry into, or further development of, lines of business in which we have not historically operated, including gaming, may expose us to business and operational\nrisks that are different from those we have experienced historically. We may not be able to effectively manage these additional risks or implement successful business strategies in new\nlines of business. Additionally, our new and existing competitors in these lines of business may possess greater operational knowledge, resources and experience than we do. These\ndiversification initiatives may not succeed and/or may not result in an increase in shareholder value and could result in a reduction in shareholder value depending upon our capital\ninvestment and success.\nCertain Regulatory Risks\nThe FCC’s media ownership rules could restrict our ability to acquire radio stations.\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules and policies limit the number of broadcasting properties that any person or entity may own (directly or by attribution) in any market and\nrequire FCC approval for transfers of control and assignments of licenses. The FCC’s media ownership rules remain subject to further agency and court proceedings. As a result of the\nFCC media ownership rules, the outside media interests of our officers and directors could limit our ability to acquire stations. The filing of petitions or complaints against Urban One or\nany FCC licensee from which we are acquiring a station could result in the FCC delaying the grant of, refusing to grant or imposing conditions on its consent to the assignment or transfer\nof control of licenses. The Communications Act and FCC rules and policies also impose limitations on non-U.S. ownership and voting of our capital stock.\n29\nTable of Contents\nEnforcement by the FCC of its indecency rules against the broadcast industry could adversely affect our business operations.\nThe FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters\nrisk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency and profanity definitions, coupled with the spontaneity of live\nprogramming. The FCC has in the past vigorously enforced its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry and has threatened to initiate license revocation proceedings against\nbroadcast licensees for “serious” indecency violations. Further, broadcasting obscene, indecent or profane programming, may potentially subject broadcasters to license revocation,\nrenewal or qualification proceedings. We may in the future become subject to inquiries or proceedings related to our stations. To the extent that these proceedings result in the imposition\nof fines, a settlement with the FCC, revocation of any of our station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflow could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in current federal regulations could adversely affect our business operations.\nCongress and the FCC have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies that could, directly or indirectly, affect the profitability of our\nbroadcast stations. In particular, Congress may consider and adopt a revocation of terrestrial radio’s exemption from paying royalties to performing artists and record companies for use of\ntheir recordings (radio already pays a royalty to songwriters, composers and publishers). In addition, commercial radio broadcasters and entities representing artists are negotiating\nagreements that could result in broadcast stations paying royalties to artists. A requirement to pay additional royalties could have an adverse effect on our business operations and\nfinancial performance. Moreover, it is possible that our license fees and negotiating costs associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our\nprogramming could sharply increase as a result of private negotiations, one or more regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. Finally, there has been in the\npast and there could be again in the future proposed legislation that requires radio broadcasters to pay additional fees such as a spectrum fee for the use of the spectrum. We cannot predict\nwhether such actions will occur.\nThe television and distribution industries in the United States are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including\nthe FCC. The television broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under\nconsideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operations of our cable\ntelevision segment. For example, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising such as product placement and product\nintegration. Enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect our cable television segment’s advertising revenues. Changes to the\nmedia ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by TV One/CLEO TV. Proposals have also been advanced\nfrom time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned by\ncable distribution systems) to all cable program services. TV One/CLEO TV’s ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such\nan extension be enacted into law. We are unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on our cable television segment’s operations.\nNew or changing federal, state or international privacy regulation or requirements could hinder the growth of our internet business.\nA variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our business uses to operate its services and to deliver certain\nadvertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially\ndisparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are now pending at both the federal and state level in the U.S. Further, third-party service\nproviders may from time to time change their privacy requirements. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements by governments or\nother businesses could hinder the growth of our business and cause us to incur new and additional costs and expenses. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or\nrequirements or with our own policies and\n30\nTable of Contents\nprocedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers.\nUnique Risks Related to Our Cable Television Segment\nThe loss of affiliation agreements could materially adversely affect our cable television segment’s results of operations.\nOur cable television segment is dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with cable and direct broadcast distributors for its revenues, and there can be no assurance\nthat these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such distributors. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of TV One’s\nand/or CLEO TV’s programming services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other\nmarketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscribers and associated subscriber fees. In addition, consolidation among cable distributors and increased\nvertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our cable television\nsegment’s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The results of renewals could have a material\nadverse effect on our cable television segment’s revenues and results and operations. We cannot assure you that TV One and/or CLEO TV will be able to renew their affiliation\nagreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of a significant number of these arrangements or the loss of carriage on basic programming tiers could reduce the\ndistribution of our content, which may adversely affect our revenues from subscriber fees and our ability to sell national and local advertising time.\nChanges in consumer behavior resulting from new technologies and distribution platforms may impact the performance of our businesses.\nOur cable television segment faces emerging competition from other providers of digital media, some of which have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In\nparticular, content offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved. Providers such as NetflixTM, HuluTM, AppleTM,\nAmazonTM and GoogleTM, as well as gaming and other consoles such as Microsoft’s XboxTM, Sony’s PS5TM, Nintendo’s WiiTM, and RokuTM, are aggressively establishing themselves as\nalternative providers of video content and services, including new and independently developed long form video content. Most recently, new online distribution services have emerged\noffering live sports and other content without paying for a traditional cable bundle of channels. These services and the growing availability of online content, coupled with an expanding\nmarket for mobile devices and tablets that allow users to view content on an on-demand basis and internet-connected televisions, may impact our cable television segment’s distribution\nfor its services and content. Additionally, devices or services that allow users to view television programs away from traditional cable providers or on a time-shifted basis and\ntechnologies that enable users to fast-forward or skip programming, including commercials, such as DVRs and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to store or make\nportable copies of content, have caused changes in consumer behavior that may affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could therefore adversely affect our revenues.\nIf we cannot ensure that our distribution methods and content are responsive to our cable television segment’s target audiences, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe acquire content and ancillary rights and pay related rights fees, license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation. We license content from other media organizations. If\ncompetitive pressures continue to increase, we may not be able to produce or acquire content in a cost-effective manner. We may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new,\npopular content or in connection with the renewals of popular rights we currently hold. Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated returns on our investments.\nUnique Risks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur President and CEO has an interest in TV One that may conflict with your interests.\nPursuant to the terms of employment with our President and CEO, Mr. Alfred C. Liggins, III, in recognition of Mr. Liggins’ contributions in founding TV One on our behalf, he is\neligible to receive an award amount equal to\n31\nTable of Contents\napproximately 4% of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of our aggregate investment in TV One (the “Employment Agreement Award”). Our\nobligation to pay the award was triggered after our recovery of the aggregate amount of capital contribution in TV One, and payment is required only upon actual receipt of distributions\nof cash or marketable securities or proceeds from a liquidity event in excess of such invested amount. Mr. Liggins’ rights to the Employment Agreement Award (i) cease if he is\nterminated for cause or he resigns without good reason and (ii) expire at the termination of his employment (but similar rights could be included in the terms of a new employment\nagreement or arrangement). As a result of this arrangement, the interest of Mr. Liggins’ with respect to TV One may conflict with your interests as holders of our debt or equity securities.\nTwo common stockholders have a majority voting interest in Urban One and have the power to control matters on which our common stockholders may vote, and their interests may\nconflict with yours.\nAs of December 31, 2023, our Chairperson and her son, our President and CEO, together held in excess of 75% of the outstanding voting power of our common stock. As a result,\nour Chairperson and our CEO control our management and policies and decisions involving or impacting Urban One, including transactions involving a change of control, such as a sale\nor merger. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other stockholders and our debt holders. In addition, certain covenants in our debt instruments require\nthat our Chairperson and the CEO maintain a specified ownership and voting interest in Urban One, and prohibit other parties’ voting interests from exceeding specified amounts. Our\nChairperson and the CEO have agreed to vote their shares together in elections of members to the Board of Directors of Urban One.\nFurther, we are a “controlled company” under rules governing the listing of our securities on the NASDAQ because more than 50% of our voting power is held by our Chairperson\nand the CEO. Therefore, we are not subject to NASDAQ listing rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors on the board; (ii) a compensation\ncommittee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers determined by a\nmajority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board’s\nselection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. While a majority of our board members are currently\nindependent directors, we do not make any assurances that a majority of our board members will be independent directors at any given time.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to our filing status will\nmake our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a “smaller reporting company” and, thus, have certain decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, including, among other things, simplified executive compensation\ndisclosures and only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a “smaller\nreporting company” may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects and may make our common stock a less attractive investment.\nIf we fail to meet the continued listing standards of NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted, which could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity and market price of our\ncommon stock and expose the Company to litigation.\nAs a result of the delayed filings of our 2022 annual report and 2023 quarterly reports (the “Delayed 2022/2023 Reports”) with the SEC, we fell out of compliance with NASDAQ\nListing Rule 5250(c) (the “Periodic Filing Rule”) which requires NASDAQ listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. After filing all of the\n2022/2023 Delayed Reports, we regained compliance with the Periodic Filing Rule on December 22, 2023, and received confirmation from NASDAQ on December 29, 2023. However,\non April 8, 2024, the Company received a new letter (the \"First 2024 NASDAQ Notice\") from NASDAQ notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the Periodic Filing\nRule as a result of not having timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”). The First 2024 NASDAQ Notice noted\nthat pursuant to the NASDAQ Listing Rules, the Company was being afforded sixty (60) calendar days, or until June 7, 2024, to regain compliance or to submit\n32\nTable of Contents\na plan to regain compliance. If NASDAQ accepts the compliance plan, NASDAQ may grant the Company an exception of up to 180 calendar days from the filing’s due date to regain\ncompliance.\nOn May 23, 2024, the Company received a second letter (the \"Second 2024 NASDAQ Notice\") from NASDAQ notifying the Company that it was further non-compliant with the\nPeriodic Filing Rule as a result of not having timely filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024 (the \"2024 Q1 Form 10-Q\" and together with the 2023\nForm 10-K, the “ 2024 Delayed Filings”) with the SEC. The Second NASDAQ Notice noted that the Company has until June 7, 2024, to file both 2024 Delayed Filings or to submit a\ncompliance plan as required by the First 2024 NASDAQ Notice.\nIf our common stock were to be delisted, the liquidity of our common stock would be adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock could decrease. In addition,\ndelayed financial reports could expose us to the risk of litigation concerning any impact upon the price of our common stock. Any such litigation could distract management from day-to-\nday operations and further adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nDisclosure Regarding Cybersecurity Risk Management\nAssessment and Management of Cybersecurity Risks:\nWe have established a robust framework for the assessment, identification, and management of material risks arising from cybersecurity threats. Our approach to cybersecurity risk\nmanagement includes ongoing assessments of potential threats and vulnerabilities, coupled with the implementation of safeguards and controls to mitigate these risks. We maintain\nvigilance over the cybersecurity landscape to identify emerging threats, adapting our strategies accordingly. Our cybersecurity risk management process includes:\n● Regular risk assessments to systematically identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks;\n● Implementation of advanced technical controls, encryption, and intrusion detection systems to safeguard sensitive data;\n● Employee training and testing programs designed to enhance awareness about cybersecurity best practices;\n● Collaboration with third-party cybersecurity experts for conducting penetration testing; vulnerability assessments and providing support in the triage of any cybersecurity event;\nand\n● Select processes to review and manage the risks associated with third-party service providers.\nMaterial Effects of Cybersecurity Threats and Incidents:\nWe acknowledge the potential material impact that cybersecurity threats and incidents can have on our operations, financial condition, and reputation. While we did not experience\nany significant cybersecurity incidents during the reporting period, we recognize that such incidents could include:\n● Disruption of our operations, potentially leading to revenue loss;\n● Unauthorized access to or theft of sensitive customer information, resulting in legal and regulatory implications; and\n● Damage to our brand and reputation, which could affect customer trust and investor confidence.\n33\nTable of Contents\nBoard Oversight:\nOur Board of Directors plays a significant role in overseeing our cybersecurity risk management efforts. The Board receives periodic updates from the Chief Information Officer\n(“CIO”) on our cybersecurity posture, encompassing reports on potential threats, vulnerabilities, and the efficacy of our risk mitigation measures. These updates are provided based on\ninternal reports from the tools employed and managed by the IT organization and reports generated by a managed security service provider overseen by the Chief Information Security\nOfficer (“CISO”). The Board is committed to ensuring that cybersecurity is a priority for the organization, providing the necessary resources and expertise to address evolving threats\neffectively.\nManagement's Role and Expertise:\nOur management team is actively involved in the assessment and management of cybersecurity risks. We have a CIO overseeing the Company’s technology infrastructure and a\ndesignated a CISO responsible for cybersecurity program oversight. The CISO possesses over two decades of comprehensive experience in the information technology landscape,\naugmented by a robust background in program management. With a portfolio enriched by industry certifications and advanced academic degrees, including an MBA, the CISO stands as\na seasoned leader within our corporate information security domain. The CISO collaborates with cross-functional teams to implement and uphold our cybersecurity policies and practices.\nOur executive leadership team is aligned with our cybersecurity objectives and regularly reviews our cybersecurity-related initiatives.\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nThe types of properties required to support each of our radio stations include offices, studios and transmitter/antenna sites. Our other media properties, such as Interactive One,\ngenerally only require office space. We typically lease our studio and office space with lease terms ranging from five to 15 years in length. A station’s studios are generally housed with\nits offices in business districts. We generally consider our facilities to be suitable and of adequate size for our current and intended purposes. We lease a majority of our main\ntransmitter/antenna sites and associated broadcast towers and, when negotiating a lease for such sites, we try to obtain a lengthy lease term with options to renew. In general, we do not\nanticipate difficulties in renewing facility or transmitter/antenna site leases, or in leasing additional space or sites, if required.\nWe own substantially all of our equipment, consisting principally of transmitting antennae, transmitters, studio equipment and general office equipment. The towers, antennae and\nother transmission equipment used by our stations are generally in good condition, although opportunities to upgrade facilities are periodically reviewed. The tangible personal property\nowned by us and the real property owned or leased by us are subject to security interests under our senior credit facility.\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nUrban One is involved from time to time in various routine legal and administrative proceedings and threatened legal and administrative proceedings incidental to the ordinary course\nof our business. Urban One believes the resolution of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nITEM 4.

(See Note 10 — Long-Term Debt of our consolidated financial statements.)\nITEM 6. [RESERVED]\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) has been revised to give effect to the revision of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, as more fully described\nin Note 2 - Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements of our consolidated financial statements.\nOverview\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, consolidated net revenue decreased approximately 1.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For 2024, our strategy will be to:\n(i) grow market share; (ii) improve audience share in certain markets and improve revenue conversion of strong and stable audience share in certain other markets; and (iii) grow and\ndiversify our revenue by executing our multimedia strategy.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nWithin our core radio business, we primarily derive revenue from the sale of advertising time and program sponsorships to local and national advertisers on our radio stations.\nAdvertising revenue is affected primarily by the advertising rates our radio stations are able to charge, as well as the overall demand for radio advertising time in a market. These rates are\nlargely based upon a radio station’s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers, the number of radio stations in the related market, and the supply of, and demand\nfor, radio advertising time. Advertising rates are generally highest during morning and afternoon commuting hours.\nNet revenue consists of gross revenue, net of local and national agency and outside sales representative commissions. Agency and outside sales representative commissions are\ncalculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing.\nThe following chart shows the percentage of consolidated net revenue generated by each reporting segment.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nRadio broadcasting segment 32.7% 32.3%\nReach Media segment 11.1% 8.9%\nDigital segment 15.8% 16.2%\nCable television segment 41.1% 43.3%\nAll other - corporate/eliminations (0.7)% (0.7)%\n36\nTable of Contents\nThe following chart shows the percentages generated from local and national advertising as a subset of net revenue from our core radio business.\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nPercentage of core radio business generated from local advertising 60.6% 57.3%\nPercentage of core radio business generated from national advertising, including network advertising 33.9% 38.8%\nNational and local advertising also includes advertising revenue generated from our digital segment. The balance of net revenue from our radio segment was generated from ticket\nsales and revenue related to our sponsored events, management fees and other revenue.\nThe following chart shows the sources of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 $ Change % Change\n(In thousands)\nNet Revenue:\nRadio advertising $ 182,362 $ 177,268 $ 5,094 2.9%\nPolitical advertising 3,881 13,226 (9,345) (70.7)\nDigital advertising 74,866 76,730 (1,864) (2.4)\nCable television advertising 108,307 112,857 (4,550) (4.0)\nCable television affiliate fees 87,747 96,963 (9,216) (9.5)\nEvent revenues & other 20,527 7,560 12,967 171.5\nNet revenue $ 477,690 $ 484,604 $ (6,914) (1.4)%\nIn the broadcasting industry, radio stations and television stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to reduce cash expenses by exchanging advertising time for goods or\nservices. In order to maximize cash revenue for our spot inventory, we closely manage the use of trade and barter agreements.\nWithin our digital segment, Interactive One generates the majority of the Company’s digital revenue. Our digital revenue is principally derived from advertising services on non-radio\nstation branded, but Company-owned websites. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. As the Company runs its advertising campaigns, the\ncustomer simultaneously receives benefits as impressions are delivered, and revenue is recognized over time. The amount of revenue recognized each month is based on the number of\nimpressions delivered multiplied by the effective per impression unit price and is equal to the net amount receivable from the customer.\nOur cable television segment generates the Company’s cable television revenue and derives its revenue principally from advertising and affiliate revenue. Advertising revenue is\nderived from the sale of television airtime to advertisers and is recognized when the advertisements are run. Our cable television segment also derives revenue from affiliate fees under\nthe terms of various multi-year affiliation agreements generally based on a per subscriber royalty for the right to distribute the Company’s programming under the terms of the distribution\ncontracts.\nReach Media primarily derives its revenue from the sale of advertising in connection with its syndicated radio shows, including the Rickey Smiley Morning Show, and the DL\nHughley Show. Reach Media also operates www.BlackAmericaWeb.com, an African-American targeted news and entertainment website, in addition to providing various other event-\nrelated activities.\n37\nTable of Contents\nExpenses\nOur significant expenses are: (i) employee salaries and commissions; (ii) programming expenses; (iii) marketing and promotional expenses; (iv) rental of premises for office facilities\nand studios; (v) rental of transmission tower space; (vi) music license royalty fees; and (vii) content amortization. We strive to control these expenses by centralizing certain functions\nsuch as finance, accounting, legal, human resources and management information systems and, in certain markets, the programming management function. We also use our multiple\nstations, market presence and purchasing power to negotiate favorable rates with certain vendors and national representative selling agencies. In addition to salaries and commissions,\nmajor expenses for our internet business include membership traffic acquisition costs, software product design, post-application software development and maintenance, database and\nserver support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with internet service provider (“ISP”) hosting services and other internet content delivery expenses. Major\nexpenses for our cable television business include content acquisition and amortization, sales and marketing.\nWe generally incur marketing and promotional expenses to increase and maintain our audiences. However, because Nielsen reports ratings either monthly or quarterly, depending on\nthe particular market, any changed ratings and the effect on advertising revenue tends to lag behind both the reporting of the ratings and the incurrence of advertising and promotional\nexpenditures.\n38\nTable of Contents\nURBAN ONE, INC.

These amounts are net of agency and outside sales representative commissions. We recognized approximately $156.2 million of revenue from our radio broadcasting segment\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $156.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $0.5 million, primarily due to\nlower political revenue offset by new stations in the Indianapolis and Houston markets. Based on reports prepared by Miller Kaplan, the markets we operate in decreased 5.5% in total\nrevenues. We experienced net revenue reduction in all of our existing radio markets, with the exception of Cleveland and Columbus. We recognized approximately $52.9 million of\nrevenue from our Reach Media segment during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $43.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of\napproximately $9.8 million. The increase was primarily driven by the addition of the Fantastic Voyage cruise during the second quarter of 2023. We recognized approximately $75.5\nmillion of revenue from our digital segment during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $78.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately\n$3.0 million. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in direct revenue. We recognized approximately $196.2 million of revenue from our cable television segment during the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, compared to $209.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $13.7 million. The decrease was primarily driven by\na decrease in affiliate fees due to subscriber churn, lower ratings and decreased advertising sales.\nOperating expenses\nProgramming and technical, excluding stock-based compensation\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 136,884 $ 122,629 $ 14,255 11.6%\nProgramming and technical expenses include expenses associated with on-air talent and the management and maintenance of the systems, tower facilities, and studios used in the\ncreation, distribution and broadcast of programming content on our radio stations. Programming and technical expenses for the radio segment also include expenses associated with our\nprogramming research activities and music royalties. For our digital segment, programming and technical expenses include software product design, post-application software\ndevelopment and maintenance, database and server support costs, the help desk function, data center expenses connected with ISP hosting services and other internet content delivery\nexpenses. For our cable television segment, programming and technical expenses include expenses associated with technical, programming, production, and content management.\nProgramming and technical expenses were $136.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $122.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of\napproximately $14.3 million. The increase in programming and technical expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the same period in 2022 was due to higher\nexpenses across most segments. Expenses in our radio broadcasting segment increased approximately $5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, due primarily to the CMG acquisition (as discussed in Note 4 – Acquisitions and Dispositions of our consolidated financial statements) as well as higher music\nroyalties, payroll, contract labor and rent expense. Expenses in our digital segment decreased approximately $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year\nended December 31, 2022 due primarily to lower content expenses and video production costs partially offset by higher payroll expenses. Expenses in our Reach Media segment\nincreased approximately $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to higher station compensation expenses.\nExpenses in our cable television segment increased approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to\nhigher content amortization expense, payroll, production facility and bad debt expense, partially offset by a decrease in promotional expenses.\n40\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 172,440 $ 160,403 $ 12,037 7.5%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with our sales departments, offices and facilities and personnel (outside of our corporate headquarters),\nmarketing and promotional expenses, special events and sponsorships and back-office expenses. Expenses to secure ratings data for our radio stations and visitors’ data for our websites\nare also included in selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses for the radio broadcasting segment and internet segment include\nexpenses related to the advertising traffic (scheduling and insertion) functions. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include membership traffic acquisition costs for our\nonline business. Selling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $172.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $160.4 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $12.0 million. Expenses in our radio broadcasting segment increased approximately $7.4 million for the year ended December 31,\n2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to higher payroll, research, travel and entertainment and insurance expenses, as well as promotional accounts.\nExpenses in our digital segment decreased approximately $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to lower\ncompensation costs. Expenses in our Reach Media segment increased $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due\nto the Fantastic Voyage cruise and to a lesser extent, higher affiliate station costs. Finally, expenses in our cable television segment decreased approximately $4.6 million for the year\nended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to a decrease in promotional, travel and entertainment expenses.\nCorporate selling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 53,583 $ 49,854 $ 3,729 7.5%\nCorporate expenses consist of expenses associated with our corporate headquarters and facilities, including personnel as well as other corporate overhead functions. Corporate\nselling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $53.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nan increase of approximately $3.7 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher third-party consulting and audit expenses, partially offset by lower executive compensation costs.\nStock-based compensation\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 9,975 $ 9,912 $ 63 0.6%\nStock-based compensation expense was approximately $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an\nincrease of approximately $0.1 million. The increase in stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to year ended December 31, 2022, was primarily due\nto the timing of grants and vesting of stock awards for certain executive officers and other management personnel.\n41\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation and amortization\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 7,101 $ 10,034 $ (2,933) (29.2)%\nDepreciation and amortization expense was approximately $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $10.0 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $2.9 million. This decrease is due to capitalized assets becoming fully depreciated.\nImpairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 129,278 $ 40,683 $ 88,595 217.8%\nImpairment of goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets was approximately $129.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $40.7 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $88.6 million. The impairment loss of $129.3 million in 2023 was entirely associated with the impairment of broadcasting\nlicenses within the radio broadcasting segment. The primary factors leading to the impairments were a decline in projected gross market revenues throughout 2023 and an increase in\ndiscount rate during the first three quarters in 2023.\nInterest income\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 6,967 $ 939 $ 6,028 642.0%\nInterest income was approximately $7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an\nincrease of approximately $6.0 million. The increase was primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalents balances during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInterest expense\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 56,196 $ 61,751 $ (5,555) (9.0)%\nInterest expense decreased to approximately $56.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a\ndecrease of approximately $5.6 million. The decrease is due to lower overall debt balances outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased\napproximately $25.0 million of its $825.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2028 (“2028 Notes”) at an average price of approximately 89.1% of par.\nGain on retirement of debt\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 2,356 $ 6,718 $ (4,362) (64.9)%\nGain on retirement of debt was approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a\ndecrease of approximately $4.4 million. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately $25.0 million of its 2028 Notes at an\naverage price of approximately 89.1% of par, resulting in a net gain on retirement of debt. During the year ended\n42\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately $75.0 million of its 2028 Notes at an average price of approximately 89.5% of par, resulting in a net gain on retirement of\ndebt of approximately $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther income, net\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 96,084 $ 16,083 $ 80,001 497.4%\nOther income, net increased $80.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the gain on sale of the\nCompany’s MGM Investment, which was recognized in other income, net, during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company\nrecognized income related to the MGM investment as well as the Paycheck Protection Program loan program (“PPP”) and related accrued interest that was forgiven in other income, net.\nProvision for income taxes\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 7,944 $ 16,418 $ (8,474) (51.6)%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a provision for income taxes of approximately $7.9 million on the pre-tax income of $17.6 million resulting with an annual\neffective tax rate of 45.0%. The difference between the effective rate and the Company’s statutory rate relates primarily to the effect of state taxes, uncertain tax positions, Internal\nRevenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382 adjustments, and permanent differences associated with non-deductible officer compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a\nprovision for income taxes of approximately $16.4 million on pre-tax income of $53.1 million resulting with an annual effective tax rate of 30.9%. This rate primarily reflects taxes at\nstatutory tax rates, and the impact of permanent differences associated with non-deductible officer compensation, and non-taxable PPP Loan income forgiveness. In general, permanent\nbook to tax differences have a greater impact on pre-tax income when the income is lower in the given period.\nLoss from unconsolidated joint venture\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ (5,131) $ — $ (5,131) 100%\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $5.1 million loss from unconsolidated joint venture related to the Company’s investment in RVAEH.\n43\nTable of Contents\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests\nYears Ended December 31, Change\n2023 2022\n$ 2,515 $ 2,317 $ 198 8.5%\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to approximately $2.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the loss from RVEAH no longer being recorded for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December\n31, 2022.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to the financial information prepared and\npresented in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures including broadcast and digital operating income and Adjusted EBITDA as additional means to evaluate our\nbusiness and operating results through period-to-period comparisons. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are\nincluded below for review. Reliance should not be placed on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nMeasurement of Performance\nWe monitor and evaluate the growth and operational performance of our business using net income and the following key metrics:\n(a) Net revenue: The performance of an individual radio station or group of radio stations in a particular market is customarily measured by its ability to generate net revenue. Net\nrevenue consists of gross revenue, net of local and national agency and outside sales representative commissions consistent with industry practice. Net revenue is recognized in the period\nin which advertisements are broadcast. Net revenue also includes advertising aired in exchange for goods and services, which is recorded at fair value, revenue from sponsored events,\nand other revenue. Net revenue is recognized for our online business as impressions are delivered. Net revenue is recognized for our cable television business as advertisements are run,\nand during the term of the affiliation agreements at levels appropriate for the most recent subscriber counts reported by the affiliate, net of launch support.\n(b) Broadcast and digital operating income: The radio broadcasting industry commonly refers to “station operating income” which consists of net income (loss) before depreciation\nand amortization, income taxes, interest expense, interest income, noncontrolling interests in income of subsidiaries, other income, net, loss from unconsolidated joint venture, corporate\nselling, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets and (gain) loss on retirement of debt. However,\ngiven the diverse nature of our business, station operating income is not truly reflective of our multi-media operation and, therefore, we use the term “broadcast and digital operating\nincome.” Broadcast and digital operating income is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. Nevertheless, broadcast and digital operating income is a significant measure\nused by our management to evaluate the operating performance of our core operating segments. Broadcast and digital operating income provides helpful information about our results of\noperations, apart from expenses associated with our fixed assets and goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets, income taxes, investments, impairment charges, debt financings\nand retirements, corporate overhead and stock-based compensation. Our measure of broadcast and digital operating income is similar to industry use of station operating income;\nhowever, it reflects our more diverse business and therefore is not completely analogous to “station operating income” or other similarly titled measures as used by other companies.\nBroadcast and digital operating income does not represent operating income or loss, or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under GAAP, and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to those measurements as an indicator of our performance.\n44\nTable of Contents\nBroadcast and digital operating income decreased to approximately $168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $201.6 million for the year\nended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $33.2 million or 16.5%. This decrease was due to lower broadcast and digital operating income at each of our segments. Our radio\nbroadcasting segment generated approximately $34.6 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $47.5\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of approximately $12.9 million, primarily due to lower net revenues and higher expenses. Reach Media generated\napproximately $17.9 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $18.9 million during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to higher expenses offset by higher revenue. Our digital segment generated approximately $20.0 million of broadcast and digital operating income\nduring the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to approximately $21.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to decrease in net revenues and increased\nexpenses. Finally, our cable television segment generated approximately $95.5 million of broadcast and digital operating income during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to\napproximately $113.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, with the decrease primarily due to lower net revenues and higher expenses.\n(c) Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income (loss) plus (1) depreciation and amortization, income taxes, interest expense, net income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests, impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, (gain) loss on retirement of debt, employment agreement award and\nother compensation, corporate development costs, severance-related costs, investment income, loss from unconsolidated joint venture, less (2) other income, net and interest income. Net\nincome before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization is commonly referred to in our business as “EBITDA.” Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are\nnot measures of financial performance under GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is often a useful measure of a company’s operating performance and is a significant measure used by\nour management to evaluate the operating performance of our business. Accordingly, based on the previous description of Adjusted EBITDA, we believe that it provides useful\ninformation about the operating performance of our business, apart from the expenses associated with our fixed assets and goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets or capital\nstructure. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used as one of the measures for comparing businesses in the broadcasting industry, although our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be\ncomparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including, but not limited to the fact that our definition includes the results of all four of our operating segments (radio\nbroadcasting, Reach Media, digital and cable television). Business activities unrelated to these four segments are included in an “all other” category which the Company refers to as “All\nother - corporate/eliminations.” Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA do not purport to represent operating income or cash flow from operating activities, as those terms are defined under\nGAAP, and should not be considered as alternatives to those measurements as an indicator of our performance.\nSummary of Performance\nThe table below provides a summary of our performance based on the metrics described above:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet revenue $ 477,690 $ 484,604\nBroadcast and digital operating income 168,366 201,572\nAdjusted EBITDA 128,379 165,180\nNet income attributable to common stockholders 2,050 34,343\n45\nTable of Contents\nThe reconciliation of net income to broadcast and digital operating income is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 2,050 $ 34,343\nAdd back/(deduct) certain non-broadcast and digital operating income items included in net income:\nInterest income (6,967) (939)\nInterest expense 56,196 61,751\nProvision for income taxes 7,944 16,418\nCorporate selling, general and administrative, excluding stock-based compensation 53,583 49,854\nStock-based compensation 9,975 9,912\nGain on retirement of debt (2,356) (6,718)\nOther income, net (96,084) (16,083)\nLoss from unconsolidated joint venture 5,131 —\nDepreciation and amortization 7,101 10,034\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,515 2,317\nImpairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets 129,278 40,683\nBroadcast and digital operating income $ 168,366 $ 201,572\nThe reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 2,050 $ 34,343\nAdd back/(deduct) certain non-broadcast and digital operating income items included in net income:\nInterest income (6,967) (939)\nInterest expense 56,196 61,751\nProvision for income taxes 7,944 16,418\nDepreciation and amortization 7,101 10,034\nEBITDA $ 66,324 $ 121,607\nStock-based compensation 9,975 9,912\nGain on retirement of debt (2,356) (6,718)\nOther income, net (96,084) (16,083)\nLoss from unconsolidated joint venture 5,131 —\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,515 2,317\nCorporate development costs 8,196 2,221\nEmployment Agreement Award and other compensation 169 1,587\nSeverance-related costs 669 850\nImpairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets 129,278 40,683\nInvestment income (expense) from MGM National Harbor1 (115) 8,804\nOther nonrecurring expenses 4,677 —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 128,379 $ 165,180\n1Investment income (expense) from MGM National Harbor is included in other income, net.\n46\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFrom time to time, the Company may repurchase its outstanding debt and/or equity securities in open market purchases.

The Current ABL Facility is governed by a credit agreement by and\namong the Company, the other borrowers party thereto, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Current ABL Facility\n47\nTable of Contents\nprovides for up to $50.0 million revolving loan borrowings in order to provide for the working capital needs and general corporate requirements of the Company. The Current ABL\nFacility also provides for a letter of credit facility up to $5.0 million as a part of the overall $50.0 million in capacity. As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding on\nthe Current ABL Facility.\nAt the Company’s election, the interest rate on borrowings under the Current ABL Facility are based on either (i) the then applicable margin relative to Base Rate Loans (as defined\nin the Current ABL Facility) or (ii) until execution of the Waiver and Amendment (as defined below) took effect, the then applicable margin relative to LIBOR Loans (as defined in\nthe Current ABL Facility) corresponding to the average availability of the Company for the most recently completed fiscal quarter.\nOn April 30, 2023, the Company entered into a waiver and amendment (the “Waiver and Amendment”) to the Current ABL Facility. The Waiver and Amendment waived certain\nevents of default under the Current ABL Facility related to the Company’s failure to timely deliver certain Annual Financial Deliverables for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022.\nAdditionally, under the Waiver and Amendment, the Current ABL Facility was amended to provide that from and after the date thereof, any request for a new LIBOR Loan (as defined in\nthe Current ABL Facility), for a continuation of an existing LIBOR Loan (as defined in the Current ABL Facility) or for a conversion of a Loan to a LIBOR Loan (as defined in the\nCurrent ABL Facility) shall be deemed to be a request for a loan bearing interest at Term SOFR (as defined in the Amended Current ABL Facility) (the “SOFR Interest Rate Change”).\nAdvances under the Current ABL Facility are limited to (a) eighty-five percent (85%) of the amount of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), less the amount, if\nany, of the Dilution Reserve (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), minus (b) the sum of (i) the Bank Product Reserve (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), plus (ii) the AP and\nDeferred Revenue Reserve (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), plus (iii) without duplication, the aggregate amount of all other reserves, if any, established by Administrative Agent.\nAll obligations under the Current ABL Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all (i) deposit accounts (related to accounts receivable), (ii) accounts receivable, and (iii) all other\nproperty which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the Current ABL Facility). The obligations are also guaranteed by all material restricted subsidiaries of the Company.\nAs the Company was undrawn under the Current ABL Facility as of the date of the Waiver and Amendment, the SOFR Interest Rate Change would only bear upon future borrowings\nby the Company such that they bear an interest rate relating to the secured overnight financing rate. These provisions of the Waiver and Amendment are intended to transition loans under\nthe Current ABL Facility to the new secured overnight financing rate as the benchmark rate.\nBetween June 5, 2023 and November 9, 2023, the Company entered into four more waiver and amendments related to the Company’s failure to timely deliver both the annual\nfinancial deliverables for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022 and quarterly financial deliverables for the quarters ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 as\nrequired under the Current ABL Facility, dated as of February 19, 2021. On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into a fifth waiver and amendment (the “Fifth Waiver and\nAmendment”) to the Current ABL Facility, dated as of February 19, 2021. The Fifth Waiver and Amendment waived certain events of default under the Current ABL Facility related to\nthe Company’s failure to timely deliver the delayed reports. The Fifth Waiver and Amendment set a due date of November 30, 2023 for the quarterly financial deliverables for the\nquarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 and a due date of December 31, 2023 for the quarterly financial deliverables for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note\n16 – Subsequent Events of our consolidated financial statements for further background on the Sixth Waiver and Amendment and the Seventh Waiver and Amendment, each executed\nafter the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Current ABL Facility matures on the earlier to occur of (a) the date that is five years from the effective date of the Current ABL Facility, and (b) 91 days prior to the maturity of\nthe Company’s 2028 Notes.\nThe Current ABL Facility is subject to the terms of the Revolver Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Current ABL Facility) by and among the Administrative Agent and\nWilmington Trust, National Association.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the interest rates in effect with respect to our debt as of December 31, 2023:\nApplicable\nAmount Interest\nType of Debt Outstanding Rate\n(In millions)\n2028 Notes, net of issuance costs (fixed rate) $ 716.2 7.375%\nAsset-backed credit facility (variable rate) (1) — —\n(1) Subject to variable SOFR or Prime plus a spread that is incorporated into the applicable interest rate.\nThe following table provides a summary of our statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities $ 64,645 $ 66,548\nNet cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 95,358 (28,683)\nNet cash flows used in financing activities (28,312) (94,704)\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were approximately $64.6 million and $66.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash flow from\noperating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023, decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in earnings partially offset by improved working capital\nrequirements, including improved collections of receivables partially offset by timing of payments. Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity\nare expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements.\nNet cash flows provided by investing activities were approximately $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and net cash flows used in investing activities were\napproximately $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the sale of the Company’s MGM investment partially offset by the\ndeconsolidation of RVAEH.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were approximately $28.3 million and $94.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We repurchased\napproximately $1.6 million and $26.5 million of our Class D Common Stock during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31,\n2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased approximately $22.3 million and $67.1 million, respectively, of our 2028 Notes. Finally, Reach Media paid approximately $4.4 million and\n$1.6 million in dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCredit Rating Agencies\nOn a continuing basis, Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Services and other rating agencies may evaluate our indebtedness in order to assign a credit rating. Our corporate\ncredit ratings by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s Investors Service are speculative-grade and have been downgraded and upgraded at various times during the last\nseveral years. Any reductions in our credit ratings could increase our borrowing costs, reduce the availability of financing to us or increase our cost of doing business or otherwise\nnegatively impact our business operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements.\n49\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 3 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements. We prepare our consolidated financial\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets\nand liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the\nfollowing policies and estimates to be most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could affect our results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows.\nGoodwill within the Radio Broadcasting Segment and Radio Broadcasting Licenses\nGoodwill exists whenever the purchase price exceeds the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad approximately $375.3 million in broadcasting licenses and $30.0 million in goodwill within the radio broadcasting segment, which totaled $405.3 million and represented\napproximately 33.4% of our total assets.\nWe account for goodwill and broadcasting licenses under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” (“ASC 350”) which requires the\nCompany to test goodwill at the reporting unit level and radio broadcasting licenses at the unit of accounting level for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate\nthat impairment may exist.\nOur annual impairment assessment is performed as of October 1 of each year using an income approach. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted\ncash flow models against available market data by comparing our overall average implied multiple based on our cash flow projections and fair values to recently completed sales\ntransactions for goodwill, and by comparing our estimated reporting unit fair values to the market capitalization of the Company. Impairment exists when the carrying value of these\nassets exceeds its respective fair value. When the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment amount is charged to operations for the excess.\nWe have 13 radio market reporting units within the radio broadcasting segment. Significant impairment charges have been an ongoing trend experienced by media companies in\ngeneral and are not unique to us.\nWe believe our estimate of the value of our radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill within the radio broadcasting segment is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant\nin relation to our total assets, and our estimate of the value uses judgmental assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and expectations about future operating\nperformance. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and estimates and market factors. The key assumptions\nassociated with determining the estimated fair value for radio broadcasting licenses include market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, operating\nprofit margin, terminal growth rate, and discount rate. The key assumptions associated with determining the estimated fair value for goodwill within the radio broadcasting segment\ninclude revenue growth rates of each radio market reporting unit, operating profit margins, terminal growth rate, and the discount rate.\nWhile we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair values, changes in any one estimate, assumption or a combination of estimates and\nassumptions, or changes in certain events or circumstances (including uncontrollable events and circumstances resulting from continued deterioration in the economy or credit markets)\ncould require us to assess recoverability of broadcasting licenses and goodwill at times other than our annual October 1 assessments, and could result in changes to our estimated fair\nvalues and further write-downs to the carrying values of these assets. Impairment charges are non-cash in nature, and as with current and past impairment charges, any future impairment\ncharges will not impact our cash needs or liquidity or our bank ratio covenant compliance.\nWe had a total goodwill carrying value of approximately $30.0 million across seven of our 13 radio market reporting units within the radio broadcasting segment as of December 31,\n2023.\n50\nTable of Contents\nAs of October 1, 2023, we performed an annual impairment assessment (quantitative for all reporting units) for goodwill. As of December 31, 2023, we performed an interim\nimpairment assessment (qualitative for six reporting units and quantitative for one reporting unit) for goodwill because of a decline in operating cash flows. Based on the annual and\ninterim impairment assessments performed, no goodwill impairment losses were recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nBased on the most recent impairment assessments performed, for the six reporting units where a qualitative assessment was performed, it was not more likely than not the fair value\nof the reporting units was less than the respective carrying amounts. For the one reporting unit where a quantitative assessment was performed, the fair value exceeded the carrying value\nby 11.1%. We do not believe we have any reporting units that are at risk of failing the quantitative impairment test.\nBelow are the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating the fair value of the goodwill for the seven radio market reporting units within the radio\nbroadcasting segment in the most recent interim impairment assessment performed as of December 31, 2023 and the annual impairment assessment performed as of October 1, 2023.\nReporting Discount Revenue Growth Terminal Growth Operating\nUnit (a) Rate Rate Range Rate Profit Margin Range\n1 10.0% (4.4) % - 0.2 % (0.5) % 29.5 % - 39.0%\n2 10.0% (2.5) % - 1.0 % (0.5) % 29.8 % - 35.3%\n6 10.0% (2.1) % - 1.5 % (0.5) % 18.6 % - 25.4%\n10 10.0% (0.7) % - 8.0 % (0.5) % 28.5 % - 34.1%\n11 10.0% (0.7) % - 0.0 % (0.5) % 9.7 % - 15.4%\n13 10.0% (0.5) % - 4.2 % (0.5) % 30.8 % - 31.7%\n16 9.0% (0.5) % - 0.2 % (0.5) % 26.0 % - 29.6%\n(a) The most recent quantitative impairment assessment was performed as of October 1, 2023 for all radio market reporting units, except for reporting unit 16 for which the most\nrecent quantitative impairment assessment was performed as of December 31, 2023.\nOur total broadcasting licenses had a total carrying value of approximately $375.3 million as of December 31, 2023. We have concluded the combined broadcasting licenses in each\nof our 13 radio markets represent a unit of accounting for impairment purposes. As of October 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023, the Company performed an annual impairment\nassessment and an interim impairment assessment, respectively, for the broadcasting licenses for all 13 radio markets to determine whether they were impaired. To determine the fair\nvalue of the broadcasting licenses, the Company utilized the income approach which values a license by calculating the value of a hypothetical startup company that initially has no assets\nexcept the asset to be valued (the license). Based on the annual assessment, there was no impairment loss to be recognized for any of the radio markets.\nThe Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $124.3 million for broadcasting licenses in eight radio markets during the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nbased on previous interim impairment assessments. Based on the most recent interim assessment as of December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately\n$5.0 million for broadcasting licenses in three radio markets during the three months ended December 31, 2023. Excluding the broadcasting licenses in the three radio markets where an\nimpairment loss was recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023, the fair value of broadcasting licenses in eight radio markets, approximately $204.9 million in\naggregate, exceeded its carrying value by less than 10% as of December 31, 2023. The broadcasting licenses in those eight radio markets are considered at risk of failing the quantitative\nimpairment assessment in future quarters if financial performance decreases.\nBelow are the key assumptions used in the income approach model for estimating the fair value of the broadcasting licenses for all 13 radio markets in the most recent impairment\nassessment performed for each market.\n51\nTable of Contents\nUnit of Carrying Value Excess % Discount Revenue Growth Terminal Growth Mature Market Operating\nAccounting (a) (in millions) FV over CV Rate Rate Range Rate Share Profit Margin\n1 $ 61.0 4.2% 9.5% (2.3) % - 0.8 % (0.5) % 15.3% 29.7%\n2 $ 3.1 530.0% 9.5% (1.9) % - 0.6 % (0.5) % 12.9% 29.5%\n4 $ 19.4 3.9% 9.5% (2.3) % - 0.8 % (0.5) % 23.2% 20.0%\n5 $ 10.2 Impaired 9.5% (2.2) % - 0.7 % (0.5) % 7.1% 27.5%\n6 $ 19.7 Impaired 9.5% (1.4) % - 0.5 % (0.5) % 14.6% 27.6%\n7 $ 12.4 0.9% 9.5% (2.3) % - 0.8 % (0.5) % 12.2% 23.0%\n8 $ 37.4 5.4% 9.5% (2.0) % - 0.7 % (0.5) % 7.1% 30.6%\n10 $ 95.8 48.4% 9.5% (1.5) % - 0.5 % (0.5) % 25.4% 31.9%\n11 $ 20.7 8.1% 9.5% (2.2) % - 0.7 % (0.5) % 30.0% 23.0%\n12 $ 10.0 1.3% 9.5% (1.9) % - 0.6 % (0.5) % 5.2% 17.0%\n13 $ 28.2 2.1% 9.5% (2.0) % - 0.7 % (0.5) % 23.8% 29.5%\n14 $ 7.4 7.4% 9.5% (2.1) % - 0.7 % (0.5) % 21.0% 19.0%\n16 $ 49.9 Impaired 10.0% (2.0) % - 0.7 % (0.5) % 15.1% 26.0%\n(a) The units of accounting are not disclosed on a specific market basis so as to not make publicly available sensitive information that could be competitively harmful to the\nCompany.\nThe following table presents sensitivity analyses for broadcasting licenses and goodwill of reporting units within the radio broadcasting segment showing the impact on our most\nrecent quantitative impairment assessment resulting from: (i) a 100 basis point decrease in industry or reporting unit terminal growth rates; (ii) a 100 basis point decrease in operating\nprofit margins; (iii) a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate; and (iv) both a 5% and 10% reduction in the fair values of broadcasting licenses and reporting units.\nHypothetical Increase in the\nRecorded Impairment Charg e\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2023\nBroadcasting\nLicenses Goodwill (a)\n(in millions)\nImpairment Charge Recorded:\nRadio Market Reporting Units $ 129.3 $ —\nHypothetical Change for Radio Market Reporting Units:\nA 100 basis point decrease in radio industry terminal growth rates $ 10.2 $ 3.7\nA 100 basis point decrease in operating profit margin in the projection period 5.5 3.4\nA 100 basis point increase in the applicable discount rate 25.1 5.4\nA 5% reduction in the fair value of broadcasting licenses and reporting units 6.6 3.8\nA 10% reduction in the fair value of broadcasting licenses and reporting units 20.1 5.8\n(a) Goodwill impairment charge applies only to further goodwill impairment and not to any potential license impairment that could result from changing other assumptions.\nSee Note 6 – Goodwill, Radio Broadcasting Licenses and Other Intangible Assets, of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company completed the sale of its MGM Investment on April 21, 2023. Please refer to Note 3(q) – Investments of our consolidated financial statements for more details. The\ninvestment in MGM National Harbor was preferred stock that had a non-transferable put right and was classified as an available-for-sale debt security. The investment was initially\nmeasured at fair value using a dividend discount model. Significant inputs to the dividend discount model include revenue growth rates, discount rate and a terminal growth rate. As of\nJune 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the investment’s fair value was measured using a contractual valuation approach. This method relied on a contractually agreed upon formula\nestablished between the Company and MGM National Harbor as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Operating\n52\nTable of Contents\nAgreement of MGM National Harbor, LLC (“the Agreement”) rather than market-based inputs or traditional valuation methods. As defined in the Agreement, the calculation of the put\nwas based on operating results, Enterprise Value and the Put Price Multiple. The inputs used in this measurement technique were specific to the entity, MGM National Harbor, and there\nare no current observable prices for investments in private companies that are comparable to MGM National Harbor. The inputs used to measure the fair value of this security are\nclassified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Throughout the periods from the fourth quarter of 2020 up until the third quarter of 2022, the Company relied on the dividend\ndiscount model for valuation purposes based on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the time. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company adopted the contractual\nvaluation method described above as it believes it more closely approximates the fair value of the investment at that time.\nThe Company accounts for an award called for in the CEO’s employment agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) at fair value. According to the Employment Agreement,\nexecuted in April 2008, the CEO is eligible to receive an award (the “Employment Agreement Award”) in an amount equal to approximately 4% of any proceeds from distributions or\nother liquidity events in excess of the return of the Company’s aggregate investment in TV One. The Company’s obligation to pay the award was triggered after the Company recovered\nthe aggregate amount of capital contributions in TV One, and payment is required only upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities or proceeds from a liquidity\nevent with respect to such invested amount. The long-term portion of the award is recorded in other long-term liabilities and the current portion is recorded in other current liabilities in\nthe consolidated balance sheets. The CEO was fully vested in the award upon execution of the Employment Agreement, and the award lapses if the CEO voluntarily leaves the Company\nor is terminated for cause. In April 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved terms for a new employment agreement with the CEO, which\nwere effective January 2022, including a renewal of the Employment Agreement Award upon similar terms as in the prior Employment Agreement.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Employment Agreement Award as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, at approximately $23.0 million and $25.7 million, respectively, and,\naccordingly, adjusted the liability to that amount. The fair value estimate incorporated a number of assumptions and estimates, including but not limited to revenue growth rates, future\noperating profit margins, discount rate, peer companies, EBITDA multiples and weighting of the income and market approach. As the Company will measure changes in the fair value of\nthis award at each reporting period as warranted by certain circumstances, different estimates or assumptions may result in a change to the fair value of the award amount previously\nrecorded.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests are interests in subsidiaries that are redeemable outside of the Company’s control either for cash or other assets. These interests are classified as\nmezzanine equity and measured at the greater of estimated redemption value at the end of each reporting period or the historical cost basis of the noncontrolling interests adjusted for\ncumulative earnings allocations. The resulting increases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are affected by corresponding charges against retained earnings, or in the\nabsence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital.\nThe Company assesses the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests in Reach Media as of the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, was approximately $16.5 million and $25.3 million, respectively. The redeemable noncontrolling interests in Reach Media are\nmeasured at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology as of December 31, 2022. Significant inputs to the discounted cash flow analysis include revenue growth rates, future\noperating profit margins, discount rate. As of December 31, 2023 the fair value is measured using an exit price methodology. Significant inputs to the exit price analysis include revenue\ngrowth rates, future operating profit margins, discount rate and an exit multiple. Different estimates and assumptions may result in a change to the fair value of the redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests amount previously recorded.\nCapital and Commercial Commitments\nIndebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $725.0 million of our 2028 Notes outstanding within our corporate structure. See Note 10 - Long-Term Debt of our consolidated\nfinancial statements. The Company had no other indebtedness.\n53\nTable of Contents\nLease Obligations\nWe have non-cancelable operating leases for office space, studio space, broadcast towers and transmitter facilities that expire over the next forty-nine years.\nOperating Contracts and Agreements\nWe have other operating contracts and agreements including employment contracts, on-air talent contracts, severance obligations, retention bonuses, consulting agreements,\nequipment rental agreements, programming related agreements, and other general operating agreements that expire over the next five years.\nRoyalty Agreements\nMusical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations, such as the ASCAP, BMI and\nSESAC. The market for rights relating to musical works is changing rapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations,\nparticularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as GMR, have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and\ndistribute them to the rights holders. These licenses periodically come up for renewal, and as a result certain of our PRO licenses are currently the subject of renewal negotiations. The\noutcome of these renewal negotiations could impact, and potentially increase, our music license fees. In addition, there is no guarantee that additional PROs will not emerge, which could\nimpact, and in some circumstances increase, our royalty rates and negotiation costs.\nThe Radio Music Licensing Committee (the “RMLC”), of which we are a represented participant: has negotiated and entered into, on behalf of participating members, an Interim\nLicense Agreement with the ASCAP effective January 1, 2022 and to remain in effect until the date on which the parties reach agreement as to, or there is court determination of, new\ninterim or final fees, terms, and conditions of a new license for the five year period commencing on January 1, 2022 and concluding on December 31, 2026. On February 7, 2022, the\nRMLC and GMR reached a settlement and achieved certain conditions which effectuate a four-year license to which the Company is a party for the period April 1, 2022 to March 31,\n2026. The license includes an optional three-year extended term that the Company may effectuate prior to the end of the initial term. The RMLC is negotiating with BMI and SESAC.\nReach Media Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, the noncontrolling interest shareholders of Reach Media have had an annual right to require Reach Media to purchase all or a portion of their shares at\nthe then current fair market value for such shares (the “Put Right”). This annual right is exercisable for a 30-day period beginning January 1 of each year. The purchase price for such\nshares may be paid in cash and/or registered Class D common stock of Urban One, at the discretion of Urban One. The noncontrolling interest shareholders of Reach Media exercised\n50% of their Put Right on January 29, 2024. Management, at this time, cannot reasonably determine the period when and if the remaining portion of the Put Right will be exercised by the\nnoncontrolling interest shareholders.\n54\nTable of Contents\nContractual Obligations Schedule\nThe following table represents our scheduled contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023:\nPayments Due by Period\n2029 and\nContractual Obligations 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Beyond Total\n(In thousands)\n7.375% Subordinated Notes (1) $ 53,469 $ 53,469 $ 53,469 $ 53,469 $ 729,456 $ — $ 943,332\nOther operating contracts/agreements (2) 88,778 37,108 14,991 4,983 3,560 9,615 159,035\nOperating lease obligations 13,767 7,658 5,674 4,148 3,114 14,726 49,087\nTotal $ 156,014 $ 98,235 $ 74,134 $ 62,600 $ 736,130 $ 24,341 $ 1,151,454\n(1) Includes interest obligations based on effective interest rates on senior secured notes outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n(2) Includes employment contracts (including the Employment Agreement Award), severance obligations, on-air talent contracts, consulting agreements, equipment rental agreements,\nprogramming related agreements, launch liability payments, asset-backed credit facility (if applicable) and other general operating agreements. Also includes contracts that our cable\ntelevision segment has entered into to acquire entertainment programming rights and programs from distributors and producers. These contracts relate to their content assets as well\nas prepaid programming related agreements.\nOf the total amount of other operating contracts and agreements included in the table above, approximately $106.0 million has not been recorded on the balance sheet as of\nDecember 31, 2023, as it does not meet recognition criteria. Approximately $33.5 million relates to certain commitments for content agreements for our cable television segment,\napproximately $29.2 million relates to employment agreements, and the remainder relates to other agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company currently is under a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement with capacity of up to $1.2 million which expires on October 8, 2024.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nOn July 12, 2023, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Audit Committee”) dismissed BDO USA, P.A. (“BDO”) as the Company’s independent registered\npublic accounting firm. On July 12, 2023, the Audit\n55\nTable of Contents\nCommittee appointed Ernst & Young LLP (EY) to serve as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.\nThe audit reports of BDO on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 contained no adverse\nopinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that BDO’s report on the Company’s financial\nstatements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 noted that “As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the 2021 consolidated financial\nstatements have been restated to correct misstatements.”\nDuring the Company’s fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and through July 11, 2023, no “reportable event” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation\nS-K occurred, other than the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting initially disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022.\nDuring the Company’s fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and through July 11, 2023, neither the Company nor anyone acting on the Company’s behalf\nconsulted with EY regarding any matters referred to in Item 304(a)(2)(i) or (ii) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nWe have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our CEO and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and\noperation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act, are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nonly provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship\nof possible controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide a reasonable level of assurance of reaching our desired disclosure controls objectives.\nBased on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2023 as a result of material\nweaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described below.\n(b) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under\nthe supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the COSO.\nWe identified certain control deficiencies in the design and implementation of our internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness\nis a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated\nannual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, we did not design and or implement an effective control environment or control\nactivities as further detailed below:\n● Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information and Communication, and Monitoring – We did not have appropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the (1)\ncontrol environment, (2) risk assessment procedures, (3) identification of control activities and (4) monitoring activities to prevent or detect material\n56\nTable of Contents\nmisstatements to the financial statements and assess whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. We did not adequately communicate the\nrelevant information, including objectives and responsibilities, necessary to support the functioning of internal controls over financial reporting. We did not develop and\nperform sufficient ongoing evaluations to ascertain whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. These deficiencies were attributed to an\ninsufficient number of qualified resources with the requisite knowledge to effectively perform control design and execution activities and oversee internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience that is commensurate with the Company’s financial reporting requirements.\n● IT General Control Activities – The Company has not sufficiently designed and maintained information technology general controls in the areas of user access, program\nchange management and IT Operations for certain information technology systems that support the Company’s financial reporting and other processes. Specifically, the\nCompany did not maintain (1) user access controls that adequately restrict privileged and end-user access to certain financial applications, system infrastructure, programs,\nand data to appropriate company personnel, including consideration of segregation of incompatible duties; (2) change management controls for certain financial applications\nand related system infrastructure to provide reasonable assurance that IT program and data changes are authorized, sufficiently tested, approved, and implemented\nappropriately; and (3) IT operations controls for certain financial applications to monitor that scheduled financial programs have run and were completed without errors.\n● Control Activities and Information and Communication - Management has determined that the Company did not have adequate selection and development of effective\ncontrol activities resulting in the following material weaknesses:\n● Management did not have properly designed internal controls over its financial statement close process. This includes an inadequate level of precision in management’s\nreview during the financial statement close process, an inadequate evaluation and review of the accounting for significant and non-recurring transactions, ineffective\ndesign and operating effectiveness of controls to support proper segregation of duties related to the review of manual journal entries and an inadequate review as part of\nits reporting and disclosure process.\n● Management did not have properly designed management review controls over matters that require significant judgment. Specifically, controls are not designed to\nsufficiently evaluate the completeness and accuracy of data used in account analyses related to judgmental areas. Additionally, the Company’s management review\ncontrols are not operating effectively, as sufficient evidence was not maintained to demonstrate that reviews occurred with a sufficient level of precision to detect a\nmaterial misstatement.\n● Management did not have appropriately designed internal controls related to the approval of IT equipment purchases and the related recognition of this equipment as a\nfixed asset. Specifically, the Company did not have effective internal controls in place to ensure IT equipment was being purchased for a valid business purpose.\nAdditionally, the Company did not have properly designed internal controls to support the existence of its IT assets.\nConsidering the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, we performed additional procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial\nstatements included in this Form 10-K were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Following such additional procedures, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that\nour consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in this Annual Report, in\nconformity with GAAP.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of\nthis Form 10-K under the caption “Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\n57\nTable of Contents\nRemediation of the Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nIn response to the material weaknesses identified, management designed a remediation plan which was approved by the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. As of June 7,2024,\nmanagement has made progress to remediate the control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses, as described below:\n● We provided training to new and existing personnel on proper execution of designed control procedures;\n● As part of our ongoing effort to expand our accounting department, we hired a Corporate Controller and a Senior VP – Finance/Chief Accounting Officer and engaged external\nresources to augment our accounting team. We developed a preliminary hiring plan which has been approved by the Audit Committee and continued to assess our personnel\nneeds, expertise and requirements and will hire personnel as needed.\n● We engaged external resources with the appropriate depth of expertise to establish a robust financial controls governance structure, conduct a financial risk assessment, establish\ninternal materiality thresholds, and identify key business processes.\n● We conducted process and control walkthroughs of all key processes to identify risk points and established corresponding controls to address identified design gaps.\n● We have initiated the process to document, implement and redesign controls, policies, and procedures with an appropriate level of precision to detect a material misstatement,\nand to retain sufficient documentation to support the operating effectiveness of the controls. The control enhancement procedures are focused on:\no Increasing the precision and specificity of our control activities, addressing completeness and accuracy of the information used in performing management review\ncontrols, as well as documenting sufficient evidence of management’s review supporting its conclusions; and\no Modifying our journal entry operating procedures to establish a formal hierarchy of review of journal entries to enforce proper segregation of duties in advance of\nimplementing a new general ledger system.\no Assessing roles and permissions across relevant financial systems and restricting access based on job responsibilities.\no Redesigning information technology general controls across relevant systems related to user access and change management.\n● We will also seek to improve the process of assessing the effectiveness of the control environment by;\no Implementing a Governance Risk and Compliance (“GRC”) tool to manage the control assessment annually; and\no Designing and implementing an ongoing controls evaluation strategy to be executed by an independent party\nManagement is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, as well as the continued improvement of the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting. The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our board of directors. We may also conclude\nthat additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses. We will not be able to conclude that we have remediated a material weakness until the applicable controls\noperate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through formal testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We will continue to monitor the design and\neffectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes management deems appropriate.\n58\nTable of Contents\n(c) Changes in internal control over financial reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we hired a Senior VP – Finance/Chief Accounting Officer and engaged additional external resources to augment our accounting team. We\nconducted process and control walkthroughs of key processes to identify risk points and established corresponding controls to address identified design gaps. We modified our journal\nentry operating procedures to establish a formal hierarchy of review of journal entries and assessed roles and permissions across relevant financial systems and restricting access based on\njob responsibilities. We also redesigned information technology general controls across relevant systems related to user access and change management. Except for these matters, there\nwere no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading\narrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of SEC Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.

Hughes,\nour Chairperson of the Board and Secretary, and Alfred C. Liggins, III, our CEO and President. See “Security Ownership of Beneficial Owners and Management” below. Therefore, we\nare not subject to NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a majority of independent directors on the board; (ii) a compensation committee\ncomposed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority\nof the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board’s selection, either\nby a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nThe Board of Directors is currently comprised of six members, four of whom are neither officers, nor employees of Urban One. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board\nof Directors was comprised of six members, four of whom were neither officers, nor employees of Urban One. The Board held five meetings during the calendar year ended December\n31, 2023, and acted three times by unanimous written consent. All six members of the Board of Directors, including each of the current six directors who are currently standing for\nelection, attended more than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board and committees thereof on which he or she served. It is the policy of the Company that all members of\nthe board of directors attend annual meetings of the stockholders. All of the directors attended the 2023 annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company.\nMs. Hughes has been Chairperson of the Board of Directors since 1980. Since the appointment of Mr. Liggins as CEO in 1997, the roles of Chairperson of the Board and CEO have\nbeen separated. We believe it is the CEO’s responsibility to run the Company and the Chairperson’s responsibility to run the Board of Directors. By having Ms. Hughes serve as\nChairperson of the Board, Mr. Liggins is better able to focus on running the day-to-day operations of the Company. Bifurcating the roles enables non-management Directors to raise\nissues and concerns for Board consideration without immediately involving the CEO. The Chairperson or lead Director also serves as a liaison between the Board and senior management\nand also provides further vision as to the strategic direction of the Company. Finally, the Board has a third leadership position in the Chairperson of our Audit Committee. As discussed\nbelow, our Audit Committee is comprised of three independent directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and\nreporting practices of Urban One and for the Company’s risk management. The Chair of the Audit Committee effectively serves as a “check” on both the Chairperson and the CEO by\nrepresenting a strong outside presence with significant financial and business experience.\n62\nTable of Contents\nThe Board of Directors believes that the appropriate leadership structure should be based on the needs and circumstances of the Board, the Company and its stockholders at a given\npoint in time, and that the Board should remain adaptable to shaping the leadership structure as those needs change in the future.\nCommunication with the Board\nOur stockholders may communicate directly with the Board of Directors. All communications should be in written form and directed to Urban One’s Assistant Secretary at the\nfollowing address:\nAssistant Secretary\nUrban One, Inc.\n1010 Wayne Avenue, 14th Floor\nSilver Spring, Maryland 20910\nCommunications should be enclosed in a sealed envelope that prominently indicates that it is intended for Urban One’s Board of Directors. Each communication intended for Urban\nOne’s Board of Directors and received by the Assistant Secretary that is related to the operation of Urban One and is relevant to the director’s service on the board shall be forwarded to\nthe specified party following its clearance through normal review and appropriate security procedures.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nThe board has a standing audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee.\nAudit Committee\nThe audit committee consists of D. Geoffrey Armstrong, Brian W. McNeill, Terry L. Jones, and B. Doyle Mitchell, each of whom satisfies the requirements for audit committee\nmembership under the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market. Each of the audit committee members is an “independent director,” as that term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of\nthe NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Mr. Armstrong, Mr. McNeill, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Mitchell qualify as “audit committee financial experts,”\nas defined by Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933. The board has adopted a written audit committee charter, which is available on our website at\nhttps://urban1.com/urban-one-investor-relations/. The audit committee met five times during the calendar year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe audit committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of Urban One, and as part of this responsibility the\naudit committee:\n● selects our independent registered public accounting firm;\n● reviews the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including non-audit services, if any;\n● reviews the scope and results of the annual audit;\n● reviews the adequacy of the system of internal accounting controls and internal control over financial reporting;\n● reviews and discusses the financial statements and accounting policies with management and our independent registered public accounting firm;\n● reviews the performance and fees of our independent registered public accounting firm;\n● reviews the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm;\n63\nTable of Contents\n● reviews the audit committee charter; and\n● reviews related party transactions, if any.\nThe audit committee also oversees Urban One’s risk policies and processes relating to the financial statements and financial reporting processes, as well as key credit liquidity risks,\nmarket risks and compliance, and the guidelines, policies and processes for monitoring and mitigating those risks.\nCompensation Committee\nOur compensation committee consists of Terry L. Jones, Brian W. McNeill, and D. Geoffrey Armstrong. The compensation committee did not meet during the calendar year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The board has adopted a revised written compensation committee charter. The functions of the compensation committee include:\n● reviewing and approving the salaries, bonuses, and other compensation of our executive officers, including stock options or restricted stock grants;\n● establishing and reviewing policies regarding executive officer compensation and perquisites; and\n● performing such other duties as shall from time to time be delegated by the board.\nNominating Committee\nOur nominating committee consists of Alfred C. Liggins, III, Catherine L. Hughes, Terry L. Jones, and Brian W. McNeill. The nominating committee is responsible for\nrecommending the criteria for selection of board members and assisting the board in identifying candidates. The nominating committee acted once by written consent during the\ncalendar year ended December 31, 2023. The nominating committee does not have a charter.\nThe nominating committee reviews the qualifications of all persons recommended by stockholders as nominees to the Board of Directors to determine whether the recommended\nnominees will make good candidates for consideration for membership on the board. The nominating committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for recommended\nnominees. However, as a matter of practice, the nominating committee evaluates recommended nominees for directors based on their integrity, judgment, independence, financial and\nbusiness acumen, relevant experience, and their ability to act on behalf of all stockholders, as well as meet the needs of the Board of Directors, including the need to have a diversity of\nperspective. In the consideration of diversity of perspective, the nominating committee is most concerned with finding nominees that counter any perceived weaknesses in board\ncomposition. Such weaknesses may include weaknesses in perspective based upon race, sex, gender identification, skill sets and industry insight particularly as the Company diversifies\nits business. Following such evaluation, the nominating committee will make recommendations for director membership and review the recommendations with the Board of Directors,\nwhich will decide whether to invite the candidate to be a nominee for election to the board. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex,\nsexual orientation, disability, or any other basis proscribed by law. The nominating committee recommended to the board that the incumbent directors be nominated for re-election to the\nboard at the 2024 annual meeting.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and meets the requirements of the rules of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. The\ncode of ethics is available on our website, www.urban1.com, or can be obtained without charge by written request to Assistant Secretary, Urban One, Inc., 14th Floor, 1010 Wayne\nAvenue, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910. We do not anticipate making material amendments to or waivers from the provisions of the code of ethics. If we make any material amendments\nto our code of ethics, or if our Board of Directors grants any waiver from a provision thereof to our executive officers or directors, we will disclose the nature of such\n64\nTable of Contents\namendment or waiver, the name of the person(s) to whom the waiver was granted and the date of the amendment or waiver in a current report on Form 8-K.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Matters\nWe recognize the importance of environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters in governance and in creating and sustaining long-term stockholder value. Given our long-\nlasting commitment to our stockholders and the communities we serve, we have invested heavily in our operations to ensure that they are conducted in a socially responsible manner. To\nprovide accountability and transparency for our stakeholders, we will provide annual updates to our ESG disclosures.\nEnvironmental\nWithin our operations, we strive toward our commitment to sustainability through building efficiency measures, use of environmentally friendly supplies, office recycling programs,\nand sustainable business practices at our consumer facing events. As a company primarily focused on broadcasting and online content, our carbon footprint is reasonably light. However,\nwe recognize that all companies have a role to play in protecting the environment and in environmental sustainability. Further, we recognize that the collective small efforts of each\nindividual can have a much larger aggregate impact on the world around us. Therefore, we are actively seeking ways to reduce energy consumption and waste.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nAs a business founded by an African American woman, diversity and inclusion is engrained in our corporate history. Our Board of Directors is diverse; Catherine L. Hughes, our\nFounder and Chairperson, is an African American woman, and four of our six directors are minorities. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, who is also a director, Alfred C.\nLiggins, III is an African American male, as is our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Kristopher Simpson. Further, Karen Wishart, our Executive Vice President, and Chief\nAdministrative Officer, is an African American woman, as is Michelle Rice, President of TV ONE. As of December 31, 2023, 74% of our employees were racially diverse, and 46% of\nour employees were women.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nCompensation Policies and Philosophy\nThe overall objective of our compensation to our executives is to attract, motivate, retain, and reward the top-quality management that we need to operate successfully and meet our\nstrategic objectives, including our diversification into a broader multi-media company. To achieve this, we aim to provide a performance-based compensation package that is competitive\nin the markets and industries in which we compete for talent, provides rewards for achieving financial, operational, and strategic performance goals, and aligns executives’ financial\ninterests with those of our shareholders.\nWe operate in the intensely competitive media industry, which is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent introduction of new media\nservices, price and cost competition, limited advertising dollars, and extensive regulation. We face many aggressive and well-financed competitors. In this environment, our success\ndepends on attracting and maintaining a leadership team with the integrity, skills, and dedication needed to manage a dynamic organization and the vision to anticipate and respond to\nfuture market developments. We use our executive compensation program to help us achieve this objective. Part of the compensation package is designed to enable us to assemble and\nretain a group of executives who have the collective and individual abilities necessary to run our business to meet these challenges. Other parts are intended to focus these executives on\nachieving financial results that enhance the value of our stockholders’ investment. At the same time, the compensation structure is flexible, so that we can meet the changing needs of our\nbusiness over time and reward executive officers and managers based on the financial performance of operations under their control.\nProcess\nOur compensation committee meets periodically throughout the year. In addition, members of the compensation committee discuss compensation matters with our CEO and CFO and\namong themselves informally outside of meetings. In establishing the compensation levels for Radio One’s executive officers, the compensation committee considers a number of\nqualitative and quantitative factors, including the competitive market for executives, the level and types of compensation paid to executive officers in similar positions by comparable\ncompanies, and an evaluation of Radio One’s financial and operational performance. We review the compensation paid to executives at other comparable media companies as a reference\npoint for determining the competitiveness of our executive compensation. Our peer group of radio broadcasting companies includes Citadel Broadcasting Corporation, Cox Radio, Inc.,\nEmmis Communications Corp.,\n69\nTable of Contents\nAudacy Communications Corp., and Saga Communications Inc. In addition, given the diversity of our business, the compensation committee may review the compensation practices at\ncompanies with which it competes for talent, including television, cable, film, online, software and other publicly held businesses with a scope and complexity like ours. The\ncompensation committee does not attempt to set each compensation element for any executive within a particular range related to levels provided by peers. Instead, the compensation\ncommittee uses market comparison as one factor in making compensation decisions. Other factors considered when making individual executive compensation decisions include\nindividual contribution and performance, reporting structure, internal pay relationship, complexity and importance of roles and responsibilities, leadership, and growth potential.\nOur CEO provides input into the compensation discussion and makes recommendations to the compensation committee for annual compensation changes and bonuses for the\nexecutive officers and the appropriateness of additional long-term incentive compensation. The compensation committee has retained and actively consults with a benefits consulting firm\nto assist with setting compensation for our executives.\nPrincipal Components of Executive Compensation\nWe seek to achieve our compensation philosophy through three key compensation elements:\n● base salary;\n● a performance-based annual bonus (that constitutes the short-term incentive element of our program), which may be paid in cash, restricted stock units, shares of stock or a\ncombination of these; and\n● grants of long-term, equity-based compensation (that constitute the long-term incentive element of our program), such as stock options and/or restricted stock units, which\nmay be subject to time-based and/or performance-based vesting requirements.\nThe compensation committee believes that this three-part approach is consistent with programs adopted by similarly situated companies and best serves the interests of our\nstockholders. The approach enables us to meet the requirements of the competitive environment in which we operate, while ensuring that executive officers are compensated in a manner\nthat advances both the short and long-term interests of our stockholders. Under this approach, compensation for our executive officers involves a high proportion of pay that is “at\nrisk,” namely, the annual bonus and the value of stock options and restricted stock units. Stock options and/or restricted stock units relate a sizable portion of each executive’s long-term\nremuneration directly to the stock price appreciation realized by our stockholders.\nThe compensation committee may award stock options or grant restricted stock to any executive officer or other eligible participants under the Plan, on its own initiative or at the\nrecommendation of management. In accordance with our Stock Plan Administration Procedures, as approved by the compensation committee, the grant date for grants approved by the\ncompensation committee to executive officers (other than a companywide grants) is the next monthly grant date immediately following the meeting of the compensation committee.\nMonthly grant dates are generally the fifth day of each month, or the next NASDAQ trading day in the event the fifth day is not a business day. However, it is also our practice in granting\noptions to executive officers to wait for the release of any material non-public information and settlement of that information in the marketplace.\nEmployment Agreements\nEmployment Agreement of the CFO\nChief Financial Officer.

These values are based on assumptions described in Note 9 to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included\nelsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n(3)For 2023 and 2022, for company automobile provided to Ms. Hughes and financial services and administrative support in the amounts of $7,015 and $4,988 and $32,985 and $43,816,\nrespectively.\n(4)Mr. Liggins’ employment terms provide, among other things, that in recognition of Mr. Liggins’ contributions in founding TV One on our behalf, he is eligible to receive an award\namount equal to approximately 4% of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of the Company's aggregate investment in TV One. The\nCompany's obligation to pay the award to Mr. Liggins was triggered during 2016 after its recovery of the aggregate amount of our pre-Comcast Buyout capital contribution in TV\nOne, and only upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities. An award in the amount of $2,939,512 and $4,038,131 was paid in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In\naddition, for 2023 and 2022, the Company provided financial services and administrative support to Mr. Liggins in the amounts of $150,000 and $166,724, respectively.\nPay Versus Performance\nAs required by new pay versus performance (“PVP”) rules adopted by the SEC in August 2022 and in effect for the first time for this proxy statement, the following Pay Versus\nPerformance table (“PVP Table”) provides required information about compensation for our named executive officers for the periods ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 (each of 2022\nand 2023, a “Covered Year”). We refer to all the named executive officers covered in the PVP Table below, collectively, as the “PVP NEOs.” The PVP Table also provides information\nabout the results for certain measures of financial performance during those same Covered Years. In reviewing this information, we believe you should consider:\n● The information in columns (b) and (d) of the PVP Table comes directly from this year’s Summary Compensation Table (or last year’s Summary Compensation Table),\nwithout adjustment, calculated in the manner as required under SEC rules for such table;\n74\nTable of Contents\n● As required by the SEC’s PVP rules, we describe the information in columns (c) and (e) of the PVP Table as “compensation actually paid” (or “CAP”) to the applicable\nPVP NEOs. However, we believe these CAP amounts do not entirely reflect the final compensation that our NEOs actually earned for their service in the Covered Years,\nrespectively. Instead, in accordance with the SEC’s PVP rules the amounts represent a combination of realized pay (primarily for cash amounts and equity that vested in the\napplicable Covered Year) and realizable or accrued pay as of the last day of the applicable Covered Year (primarily for equity awards that are unvested or vested but\nunexercised). As a result, we urge investors to use caution when evaluating CAP amounts, as they are calculated in a manner different than any information that we may\nhave presented before; and\n● As required by the SEC’s PVP rules, we provide information in the PVP Table below about our absolute total shareholder return (“TSR”) results and our U.S. GAAP net\nincome results (the “External Measures”) during the Covered Years. In column (h) we also present information with respect to our Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is\na non-GAAP financial measure. We present this measure as management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors by\nexcluding certain income/(loss), expenses and gains and losses that may not be indicative of the Company’s core operating and financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is a\nuseful performance measure because certain items included in the calculation of net income/(loss) may either mask or exaggerate trends in the Company's ongoing\noperating performance measures, by identifying the individual adjustments, provide a useful mechanism for investors to consider these adjusted measures with some or all\nthe identified adjustments. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the comparable GAAP financial measure is included in Non-GAAP Financial Measures in ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of this Form 10-K.\nPay Versus Performance\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h)\nAverage Summary Average Value of Initial\nCompensation Compensation Fixed $100\nSummary Table Total for Actually Paid to Investment\nCompensation Compensation Non-PEO Named Non-PEOs Based on Total Adjusted\nTable Total for Actually Paid to Executive Named Executive Shareholder Net Income EBITDA\nYear PEO (1) PEO (1)(2) Officers (1) Officers (1)(2) Return (3) (in thousands) (in thousands)\n2023 $ 7,449,520 $ 1,250,000 $ 2,340,557 $ 950,000 $ 0 $ 5,928 $ 128,378\n2022 $ 9,872,204 $ 1,250,000 $ 2,740,532 $ 1,691,500 $ 0 $ 36,660 $ 165,179\n(1) Reflects the total compensation of our current President and CEO, Alfred C. Liggins, III, who is our PEO. Our non-PEO PVP NEOs (“Non-PEO NEOs”) were Catherine L.\nHughes, our Chairperson, and Peter D. Thompson, our Chief Financial Officer, for each of the Covered Years. Amounts shown are as calculated in the Summary\nCompensation Table (SCT) for each of the years shown.\n(2) For each covered year, in determining both the compensation actually paid for our PEO and the average compensation actually paid for our Non-PEO NEOs for purposes of\nthis PVP Table, we deducted from or\n75\nTable of Contents\nadded back to the total amount of compensation reported in column (b) and column (d) for such Covered Year the following amounts:\nItem and Value Added (Deducted) 2023 2022\nFor Mr. Liggins:\nDeduction for Summary Compensation Table “Stock Awards” column value $ 2,473,371 $ 1,712,663\nDeduction for Summary Compensation Table “Option Awards” column value 636,637 517,186\nIncrease for year-end fair value of outstanding equity awards granted in Covered Year 0 0\nIncrease/Decrease for change in fair value of outstanding equity awards granted in prior years 2,261,624 2,921,970\nIncrease for vesting date fair value of equity awards granted and vested in Covered Year 0 0\nIncrease/Decrease for change in fair value of prior-year equity awards vested in Covered Year 0 0\nDecrease for prior year-end fair value of prior-year equity awards forfeited in Covered Year 0 0\nIncrease for includable dividends/earnings on equity awards during Covered Year 0 0\nItem and Value Added (Deducted) 2023 2022\nFor Non-PEO Named Executive Officers (Average):\nDeduction for Summary Compensation Table “Stock Awards” column value $ 1,103,408 $ 788,168\nDeduction for Compensation Table “Option Awards” column value 267,150 236,461\nIncrease for year-end fair value of outstanding equity awards granted in Covered Year 0 0\nIncrease/Decrease for change in fair value of outstanding equity awards granted in prior years 846,189 1,352,518\nIncrease for vesting date fair value of equity awards granted and vested in Covered Year 0 0\nIncrease/Decrease for change in fair value of prior-year equity awards vested in Covered Year 0 0\nDecrease for prior year-end fair value of prior-year equity awards forfeited in Covered Year 0 0\nIncrease for includable dividends/earnings on equity awards during Covered Year 0 0\n(3) For each Covered Year, our total shareholder return (“TSR”) was calculated based on the yearly percentage change in our cumulative TSR on each of our Class A and Class D\ncommon stock, measured as the quotient of (a) the sum of (i) the cumulative amount of dividends for a period beginning with our closing price on the NASDAQ Global Market\non December 31, 2021 through and including the last day of the fiscal year covered (each one- or two-year period, the “Measurement Period”), assuming dividend reinvestment,\nplus (ii) the difference between our closing Class A and Class D stock prices at the end versus the beginning of the Measurement Period, divided by (b) our closing Class A and\nClass D share prices at the beginning of the Measurement Period. Each of these yearly percentage changes was then applied to a deemed fixed investment of $100 at the\nbeginning of each Measurement Period to produce the Covered Year-end values of such investment as of the end of 2023 and 2022, as applicable. Because Covered Years are\npresented in the table in reverse chronical order (from top to bottom), the table should be read from bottom to top for purposes of understanding cumulative returns over time.\n76\nTable of Contents\nThe following charts provide, across the Covered Years, descriptions of the relationships between (1) the CAP for the PEO and the average CAP for our Non-PEO NEOs (in each\ncase as set forth in the PVP Table above) and (2) each of the performance measures set forth in columns (f) and (g) of the PVP Table above.\n77\nTable of Contents\nITEM 12.

Once a related person transaction has been identified, the Board of Directors may appoint a special\ncommittee of the Board of Directors to review and, if appropriate, approve such transaction. The special committee will consider the material facts, such as the nature of the related\nperson’s interest in the transaction, the terms of the transaction, the importance of the transaction to the related person and to us, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than\nterms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, and other matters it deems appropriate.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023, and the\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 7, 2024, expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the\napplicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to\nthe audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex\njudgments. The communication of this critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nF-1\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Radio Market Goodwill and Radio Market Broadcasting Licenses\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Company's goodwill balance attributable to its radio market reporting units was $30 million and the balance related to its radio\nbroadcasting licenses with indefinite lives was $375 million. As explained in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and radio broadcasting\nlicenses are subject to annual impairment assessments, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. The Company recorded\nan impairment charge of $129 million related to its radio broadcasting licenses during the year ended December 31, 2023. No impairment charges were\nrecorded related to the Company’s goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAuditing the Company’s impairment assessments for radio market goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses is complex and highly judgmental and required the\ninvolvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant estimation required by management in determining the fair value of the radio market goodwill\nreporting units and radio broadcasting licenses. For radio market goodwill, the Company's methodologies for estimating the fair value of the reporting units\ninvolve significant assumptions and inputs, including projected financial information for market revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, terminal growth\nrates and discount rates. For radio broadcasting licenses, the Company's methodologies for estimating the fair value of these assets involve significant\nassumptions and inputs, including projected financial information for market revenues, revenue growth by market, mature market share, operating profit\nmargins, terminal growth rates and discount rates. All of the assumptions are sensitive to and affected by economic, industry, and company-specific qualitative\nfactors. These significant assumptions and inputs are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our Audit To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s radio market goodwill reporting units and its radio broadcasting licenses, we performed audit procedures that\nincluded, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies, and testing the significant assumptions described above used in the Company’s analyses, as\nwell as testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions to current\nindustry and market trends, and to the Company's historical results. In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of management’s prior year estimates. We also\nperformed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the potential change in the fair values of the radio market goodwill reporting units and\nradio broadcasting licenses resulting from hypothetical changes in underlying assumptions. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in our evaluation of\nthe methodologies used and certain significant assumptions and inputs used by the Company to determine the estimated fair value of the radio market goodwill\nreporting units and radio broadcasting licenses. In addition, for goodwill, we tested management’s reconciliation of the fair value of its reporting units to the\nmarket capitalization of the Company.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2023.\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJune 7, 2024\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Urban One, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Urban One, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses\ndescribed below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Urban One, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement\nof the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in\nmanagement’s assessment. Management has identified pervasive material weaknesses throughout the Company’s internal control processes that involve the control environment, risk\nassessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring components of the COSO framework that are described in more detail in management’s assessment.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the\nCompany as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statement of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and the related notes. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2023\nconsolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated June 7, 2024, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether\neffective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of\nfinancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJune 7, 2024\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nUrban One, Inc.\nSilver Spring, Maryland\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Urban One, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022\n1. ORGANIZATION:\nUrban One, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Urban One,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and/or “us”) is an urban-oriented, multi-media company that\nprimarily targets African-American and urban consumers. Our core business is our radio broadcasting franchise which is the largest radio broadcasting operation that primarily targets\nAfrican-American and urban listeners. As of December 31, 2023, we owned and/or operated 72 independently formatted, revenue producing broadcast stations (including 57 FM or AM\nstations, 13 HD stations, and the 2 low power television stations we operate), located in 13 of the most populous African-American markets in the United States. While a core source of\nour revenue has historically been and remains the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations, our strategy is to operate the premier multi-media\nentertainment and information content platform targeting African-American and urban consumers. Thus, we have diversified our revenue streams by making acquisitions and investments\nin other complementary media properties. Our diverse media and entertainment interests include TV One, LLC (“TV One”), which operates two cable television networks targeting\nAfrican-American and urban viewers, TV One and CLEO TV; our 90.0% ownership interest in Reach Media, Inc. (“Reach Media”) which operates the Rickey Smiley Morning Show and\nour other syndicated programming assets, including the Get Up! Mornings with Erica Campbell Show and the DL Hughley Show; and Interactive One, LLC (“Interactive One”), our\nwholly owned digital platform serving the African-American community through social content, news, information, and entertainment websites, including its iONE Digital, Cassius and\nBossip, HipHopWired and MadameNoire digital platforms and brands. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its investment in MGM National\nHarbor (the “MGM Investment”), a gaming resort located in Prince George’s County, Maryland. Please refer to Note 3(q) – Investments of our consolidated financial statements for more\ndetails. Through our national multi-media operations, we provide advertisers with a unique and powerful delivery mechanism to communicate with African-American and urban\naudiences.\nOur core radio broadcasting franchise operates under the brand “Radio One.” We also operate other brands, such as TV One, CLEO TV, Reach Media, iONE Digital and One\nSolution, while developing additional branding reflective of our diverse media operations and our targeting of African-American and urban audiences.\nAs part of our consolidated financial statements, consistent with our financial reporting structure and how the Company currently manages its businesses, we have provided selected\nfinancial information on the Company’s four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) Reach Media; (iii) digital; and (iv) cable television. (See Note 15 – Segment Information of\nour consolidated financial statements).\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and require management\nto make certain estimates and assumptions. The most significant estimates and assumptions are used in determining: (i) estimates of future cash flows used to evaluate and recognize\nimpairments; (ii) estimates of fair value of Employment Agreement Award and redeemable noncontrolling interests in Reach Media; (iii) deferred taxes and related valuation allowance,\nincluding uncertain tax positions; (iv) determination of the amortization patterns of content assets; and (v) estimate allowance for expected credit losses on trade accounts receivable.\nThese estimates and assumptions may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial\nstatements. The Company bases these estimates on historical experience, current economic environment or various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the\ncircumstances. However, economic uncertainty and any disruption in financial markets increase the possibility that actual results may differ from these estimates.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of Urban One and subsidiaries in which Urban One has a controlling financial interest, which is generally\ndetermined when the Company holds a majority voting interest. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Noncontrolling interests have been\nrecognized where a controlling interest exists, but the Company owns less than 100% of the controlled entity.\nThe Company is required to include the financial statements of variable interest entities (“VIE”) in its consolidated financial statements. Under the VIE model, the Company\nconsolidates an investment if it has control to direct the activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the\nVIE.\n2. REVISION OF PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn connection with the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements for the quarterly period as of March 31, 2023, the Company identified immaterial errors in its\naccounting for its stock-based compensation expense, the Company’s investment in the operations of RVA Entertainment Holdings, LLC (“RVAEH”), and related tax effects. The\nCompany assessed the materiality of the adjustments both quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded that the adjustments were not material to its previously issued consolidated\nfinancial statements as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and for the years then ended. However, the Company concluded that the effect of correcting these adjustments in 2023 would\nmaterially misstate the Company’s unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Accordingly, the Company determined that it was\nnecessary to reflect these adjustments, as well as other immaterial adjustments previously identified during fiscal year 2022 and revised the previously issued consolidated financial\nstatements with respect to the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2022, and the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 16 – Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\nfor the revised quarterly and year-to-date unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30, 2022. The remainder of the notes to\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements have been updated and revised, as applicable, to reflect the impact of these adjustments.\nAdjustments Background\nStock-Based Compensation\nOn September 27, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Compensation Committee”) approved the principal terms of new employment\nagreements for the Company’s Founder and Executive Chairperson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Pursuant to the\nterms, annual Class D stock awards and stock options with fixed monetary value known at inception were awarded. The first tranche of equity awards was granted and vested on\nSeptember 27, 2022. The second and third annual grants were scheduled to vest in January 2023 and January 2024, respectively, with the grant price equal to the closing share price on\nthe fifth calendar day of the month following the date on which vesting occurs (February 5, each of 2023 and 2024) (“Executive Awards”).\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Company determined that it should have recognized expense for the second tranche of the Executive Awards during the third and fourth quarters\nof 2022 beginning at the service inception date that precedes the grant date and to classify these grants as a liability until vested. The effect of this adjustment was an understatement of\nstock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 and understatements of other current liabilities and accumulated\ndeficit in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2022.\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nRVAEH\nIn 2021, the Company and Peninsula Pacific Entertainment entered into a 75/25 partnership of RVAEH. During the preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements for\nthe quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company evaluated whether it should have consolidated RVAEH due to its 75% ownership interest. As the Company had control and was the\nprimary beneficiary of RVAEH, it was determined that RVAEH should have been consolidated in 2021 in accordance with ASC 810, “Consolidation”.\nThe Company historically recognized its 75% ownership portion of RVAEH’s financial statements on its consolidated financial statements under the equity method of accounting.\nThe adjustment primarily impacted restricted cash, other current assets, property and equipment, net, other current liabilities, other long-term liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling\ninterests, and accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets, and corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in\nthe consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Adjustments\nThe Company, in the process of correcting the immaterial errors discussed above, recorded other immaterial adjustments previously identified during fiscal year 2022. The\nadjustments, in aggregate, impacted trade accounts receivable, net, accounts payable, other long-term liabilities, and accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets and selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, corporate selling, general and administrative expenses, and related tax effect in the consolidated statements of operations.\nRevised Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe following tables reflect the correction of the immaterial errors and adjustments, discussed above, on the affected line items presented in the Company’s consolidated financial\nstatements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The previously reported amounts were derived from the Company's fiscal year 2022 Form 10-K. These amounts are labeled\nas “As Previously Reported” in the tables below. The columns labeled “Adjustments” represent the combined effects of the corrections of the stock-based compensation, the consolidation\nof RVAEH, and related tax effects. The columns labeled “Other Adjustments” represent the combined effects of the corrections of other immaterial adjustments and related tax effects.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nRevised Consolidated

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\n(a) Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and money market funds at various commercial banks that have original maturities of 90 days or less. For cash and cash equivalents, cost\napproximates fair value. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). However, the Company has amounts held with\nbanks that may exceed the amount of FDIC insurance provided on such accounts. Generally, the balances may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of\nreputable credit, and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk.\nIn July 2021, RVAEH, a previously consolidated joint venture of the Company, entered into a Host Community Agreement (the “Original HCA”) with the City of Richmond (the\n“City”) for the development of the ONE Casino + Resort, (the “Project”), and the partners of RVAEH made an initial investment of $26.0 million (the “Upfront Payment”) into an escrow\naccount. In February 2023, given a change in the joint venture ownership structure, RVAEH no longer met the consolidation requirements and therefore, the Company began accounting\nfor its investment in RVAEH under the equity method. Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated RVAEH (including $26.0 million in restricted cash) from its consolidated financial\nstatements. RVAEH’s restricted cash on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets was $0.0 million and $26.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nF-16\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as reported within the consolidated balance sheets to “Cash, cash equivalents and restricted\ncash, end of period” as reported within the consolidated statements of cash flows:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 233,090 $ 75,404\nRestricted cash 480 26,475\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in Consolidated Statements\nof Cash Flows $ 233,570 $ 101,879\n(b) Trade Accounts Receivable\nThe Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326):\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”) on January 1, 2023. The Company estimates the allowance for expected credit losses on trade accounts\nreceivable in pools based on the Company’s four reportable segments and historical credit loss information over a defined period adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts. Large individual receivables for which there is indication of increased credit risk are individually assessed for loss allowances. The Company reports the allowance\nfor expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The allowance for expected credit losses is reviewed periodically by management.\nTrade accounts receivable, which consist of both billed and unbilled receivables, are recorded at their invoiced amount, and presented as net of an allowance for expected credit loss.\nInactive delinquent accounts that are past due beyond a certain number of days are written off and often pursued by other collection efforts. Bankruptcy accounts are immediately written\noff upon receipt of the bankruptcy notice from the courts. Subsequent recoveries of these amounts are recorded as received.\nAllowance for Expected Credit Losses\nThe changes in the allowance for expected credit loss are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(In thousands)\nBalance at Beginning of Period(1) $ 8,643\nCharged to Expense, net 2,552\nLess: Deductions (2,557)\nBalance at End of Period $ 8,638\n(1) The allowance for expected credit loss as of January 1, 2023 includes $0.6 million cumulative-effect adjustment of the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\n(c) Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets (Primarily Radio Broadcasting Licenses)\nIn connection with past acquisitions, a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to radio broadcasting licenses, goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill consists\nof the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but\nare tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level and unit of accounting level, respectively. The Company tests for impairment annually, on October 1 of each year, or more\nfrequently when events or changes in circumstances or other conditions suggest impairment may have occurred. Radio broadcasting license impairment exists when the asset carrying\nvalues exceed their respective fair values. The excess is recorded to operations as an impairment\nF-17\nTable of Contents\ncharge. The Company tests for radio broadcasting license impairment at the unit of accounting level using the income approach, which involves, but is not limited to, judgmental\nestimates and assumptions about market revenue and projected revenue growth by market, mature market share, operating profit margin, discount rate and terminal growth rate. In testing\nfor goodwill impairment, the Company also relies primarily on the income approach that estimates the fair value of the reporting unit, which involves, but is not limited to, judgmental\nestimates and assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating profit margins, discount rate and terminal growth rate. The Company then performs a market-based analysis by\ncomparing the average implied multiple arrived at based on the Company’s cash flow projections and estimated fair values to multiples for actual recently completed sale transactions and\nby comparing the total of the estimated fair values of the Company’s reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company. The Company recognizes an impairment charge to\noperations in the amount that the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Any impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the\nreporting unit.\n(d) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets, Excluding Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nLong-lived assets, excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. If an impairment indicator is present, the Company evaluates recoverability by a comparison of the carrying\namount of the asset or group of assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or group of assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which\nthere are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. If the assets are impaired, the impairment recognized is measured by the\namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset or group of assets. Fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted future cash flows. The discount\nrate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate of return for a similar investment of like risk. The Company reviewed these long-lived assets during 2023 and 2022\nand concluded no impairment to the carrying value of these assets was required.\n(e) Financial Instruments\nAs of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company’s financial instruments consisted of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade accounts receivable, asset-backed credit\nfacility, long-term debt, and debt securities. The carrying amounts approximated fair value for each of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, except for the\nCompany’s long-term debt. On January 25, 2021, the Company borrowed $825.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due February 2028 and bearing interest at\na rate of 7.375% (the “2028 Notes”). The 2028 Notes had a carrying value of approximately $725.0 million and fair value of approximately $616.3 million as of December 31, 2023, and\nhad a carrying value of approximately $750.0 million and fair value of approximately $646.9 million as of December 31, 2022. The fair values of the 2028 Notes, classified as a Level 2\ninstrument, was determined based on the trading values of this instrument in an inactive market as of the reporting date. There were no borrowings outstanding on the Company’s asset-\nbacked credit facility as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n(f) Revenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in\nexchange for those goods or services. In general, spot and digital advertising is satisfied as advertising spots or as impressions are delivered. For cable television affiliate revenue, the\nCompany grants a license to the affiliate to distribute its television programming content through the license period, and the Company recognizes revenue based on the number of\nsubscribers each month. Finally, for event-based revenue, the Company’s events typically occur on one specified date when revenue is recognized. However, there may be performance\nobligations that are satisfied in the weeks leading up to the event, such as radio and digital advertising. In such instances revenue is recognized as the underlying performance obligations\nare satisfied based on the allocated transaction price and the pattern of delivery to the customer.\nWithin the radio broadcasting and Reach Media segments, revenues are generated from the sale of spot advertisements and sponsorships. Revenue from the sale of spot\nadvertisements is recognized over time when the advertisements are run. Revenue from sponsorships is recognized as each underlying sponsorship performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue is\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nrecognized for each performance obligation based on the allocated transaction price and the pattern of transfer to the customer. The Company records as revenue the amount of\nconsideration that it receives. For the radio broadcasting and Reach Media segments, agency and outside sales representative commissions were approximately $18.8 million and $18.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Radio broadcasting and Reach Media’s contracts with advertisers are typically a year or less in duration and are\ngenerally billed monthly upon satisfaction of the performance obligations.\nWithin the digital segment, Interactive One generates the majority of the Company’s digital revenue. The Company’s digital revenue is principally derived from advertising services\non non-radio station branded but Company-owned websites. Advertising services include the sale of banner and sponsorship advertisements. As the Company runs its advertising\ncampaigns, the customer simultaneously receives benefits as impressions are delivered, and revenue is recognized over time. The amount of revenue recognized each month is based on\nthe number of impressions delivered multiplied by the effective per impression unit price. Interactive One’s contracts with advertisers are typically a year or less in duration and are\ngenerally billed monthly upon satisfaction of the performance obligations.\nThe cable television segment derives advertising revenue from the sale of television airtime to advertisers and revenue is recognized over time when the advertisements are run. In\nthe agreements governing advertising campaigns, the Company may also promise to deliver to its customers a guaranteed minimum number of viewers or impressions on a specific\ntelevision network within a particular demographic. These guaranteed advertising campaigns are considered to represent a single, distinct performance obligation. For these campaigns,\nrevenues are recognized based on the audience levels reached multiplied by the average price per impression. The Company provides the advertiser with advertising until the guaranteed\naudience level is delivered, and invoiced amounts may exceed the value of the actual audience delivery. As such, a portion of revenues associated with such campaigns is deferred until\nthe guaranteed audience level is delivered or the rights associated with the guarantees lapse, which is typically less than one year. Actual audience and delivery information is obtained\nfrom independent ratings services. The Company records as revenue the amount of consideration that it receives. TV One’s contracts with advertisers are typically a year or less in\nduration and are generally billed monthly upon satisfaction of the performance obligations.\nThe Company’s cable television segment also derives revenue from affiliate fees under the terms of various multi-year affiliation agreements based on a per subscriber royalty\npayable by the affiliate, in exchange for the right to distribute the Company’s programming. The majority of the Company’s distribution fees are collected monthly throughout the year\nand distribution revenue is recognized over the term of the contracts based on contracted programming rates and reported subscriber levels. The Company applies the sales- or usage-\nbased royalty exception for its affiliate agreements. The amount of distribution fees due to the Company is reported by distributors based on actual subscriber levels. Such information is\ngenerally not received until after the close of the reporting period. In these cases, the Company estimates the number of subscribers receiving the Company’s programming to estimate\nroyalty revenue. Historical adjustments to recorded estimates have not been material. Revenues from the Company’s cable television segment are reduced by the amortization of the\nCompany’s launch support assets. Agency and outside sales representative commissions were approximately $19.4 million and $20.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nSome of the Company’s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. In an arrangement with multiple distinct performance obligations, the transaction price is\nallocated among the separate performance obligations on a relative stand-alone selling price basis. The stand-alone selling price is determined with consideration given to market\nconditions, the size and scope of the contract, customer information, and other factors.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nRevenue by Contract Type\nThe following chart shows the sources of the Company’s net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nRadio Reach Cable\n(In thousands) Broadcasting Media Digital Television Eliminations Consolidated\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nNet Revenue:\nRadio advertising $ 146,171 $ 39,851 $ - $ - $ (3,660) $ 182,362\nPolitical advertising 2,854 398 629 - - 3,881\nDigital advertising - - 74,866 - - 74,866\nCable television advertising - - - 108,307 - 108,307\nCable television affiliate fees - - - 87,747 - 87,747\nEvent revenues & other 7,189 12,639 - 153 546 20,527\nNet revenue $ 156,214 $ 52,888 $ 75,495 $ 196,207 $ (3,114) $ 477,690\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nNet Revenue:\nRadio advertising $ 139,470 $ 41,414 $ - $ - $ (3,616) $ 177,268\nPolitical advertising 11,143 287 1,796 - - 13,226\nDigital advertising - - 76,730 - - 76,730\nCable television advertising - - - 112,857 - 112,857\nCable television affiliate fees - - - 96,963 - 96,963\nEvent revenues & other 6,065 1,416 - 51 28 7,560\nNet revenue $ 156,678 $ 43,117 $ 78,526 $ 209,871 $ (3,588) $ 484,604\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets and contract liabilities that are not separately stated in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nContract assets:\nUnbilled receivables $ 5,437 $ 12,597\nContract liabilities:\nCustomer advances and unearned income $ 4,851 $ 6,123\nReserve for audience deficiency 12,779 9,629\nUnearned event income 4,864 5,708\nUnbilled receivables consist of earned revenue that has not yet been billed. Contract assets are included in trade accounts receivable, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCustomer advances and unearned income represent advance payments by customers for future services under contract that are generally incurred in the near term. For advertising sold\nbased on audience guarantees, audience deficiency typically results in an obligation to deliver additional advertising units to the customer, generally within one year of the campaign end\ndate. To the extent that audience guarantees are not met, a reserve for audience deficiency is recorded until such a time that the audience guarantee has been satisfied. Unearned event\nincome represents payments by customers for upcoming events. Contract liabilities are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nFor customer advances and unearned income as of January 1, 2023, $3.7 million was recognized as revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the reserve for audience\ndeficiency as of January 1, 2023, $6.0 million was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023. For unearned event income as of January 1, 2023, $5.7 million was\nrecognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPractical expedients and exemptions\nThe Company generally expenses employee sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within\nselling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which\nvariable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.\n(g) Launch Support\nThe cable television segment has entered into certain affiliate agreements requiring various payments for launch support. Launch support assets are used to initiate carriage under\naffiliation agreements and are amortized over the term of the respective contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company paid approximately $4.3 million and\n$9.3 million, respectively, for carriage initiation. The weighted-average amortization period for launch support was approximately 8.1 years as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The\nremaining weighted-average amortization period for launch support was 2.9 years and 3.8 years as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Amortization is recorded as a reduction to revenue.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, launch support asset amortization was approximately $5.0 million and $4.4 million, respectively. Launch assets are included in other\nintangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets, except for the portion of the unamortized balance that is expected to be amortized within one year which is included in other\ncurrent assets.\nThe gross value and accumulated amortization of the launch assets is as follows:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nLaunch assets $ 27,764 $ 27,764\nLess: accumulated amortization (14,084) (9,104)\nLaunch assets, net $ 13,680 $ 18,660\nFuture estimated launch support amortization related to launch assets for years 2024 through 2028 and thereafter is as follows:\n(In thousands)\n2024 $ 4,980\n2025 4,980\n2026 3,409\n2027 237\n2028 68\nThereafter 6\n(h) Barter Transactions\nIn a barter transaction, the Company provides broadcast advertising time in exchange for programming content and certain services. The Company includes the value of such\nexchanges in both broadcasting net revenue and station operating expenses. The valuation of barter time is based upon the fair value of the network advertising time provided for the\nprogramming content and services received. Barter transaction revenues were approximately $3.2 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nBarter transaction costs reflected in programming and\nF-21\nTable of Contents\ntechnical expenses were approximately $1.7 million and approximately $1.3 million, respectively for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Barter transaction costs reflected in\nselling, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1.5 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(i) Advertising and Promotions\nThe Company expenses advertising and promotional costs as incurred. Total advertising and promotional expenses for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, were\napproximately $27.1 million and $31.3 million, respectively.\n(j) Income Taxes\nThe Company recognizes income taxes in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based upon the difference between\nfinancial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax\nrates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized into income in the period of enactment. Deferred income tax expense or benefits are based upon the changes in the net deferred tax\nasset or liability from period to period.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, management\nconsiders all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and\nresults of recent operations. If management determines that the Company would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company\nwould make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Conversely, if management determines that the Company\nwould not be able to realize the recorded amount of deferred tax assets in the future, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would\nincrease the provision for income taxes.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on\nthe basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax\nbenefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax\nbenefits on the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included in other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\n(k) Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation cost for stock options based on the award’s fair value at the grant date as calculated by the Black-Scholes valuation option-\npricing model (“BSM”). The Company recognizes expense ratably over the requisite service period. The BSM incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected stock price\nvolatility, for which historical data is heavily relied upon, expected life of options granted and interest rates. The Company measures compensation expense for restricted stock grants\nbased on the fair value on the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock grants ratably during the vesting period. The Company accounts for\nforfeitures as they occur. The fair value measurement objective for liabilities incurred in a share-based payment transaction is the same as for equity instruments. Awards classified as\nliabilities are subsequently remeasured to their fair values at the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled.\n(l) Segment Reporting and Major Customers\nThe Company has determined it has four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) Reach Media; (iii) digital; and (iv) cable television. These four segments operate in the\nUnited States and are consistently aligned with the Company’s management of its businesses and its financial reporting structure.\nThe radio broadcasting segment consists of all broadcast results of operations. The Reach Media segment consists of the results of operations for the related activities and operations\nof the Company’s syndicated shows. The digital segment\nF-22\nTable of Contents\nincludes the results of the Company’s online business, including the operations of Interactive One, as well as the digital components of the Company’s other reportable segments. The\ncable television segment consists of the Company’s cable TV operation, including results of operations of TV One and CLEO TV. Business activities unrelated to these four segments are\nincluded in an “all other” category which the Company refers to as “All other - corporate/eliminations.”\nNo single customer accounted for over 10% of the Company’s consolidated net revenues during either of the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\n(m) Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is presented in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities: Class A,\nClass B, Class C, and Class D common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion,\nand transfer rights.\nBasic net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average\nnumber of common shares outstanding during the period.\nFor the calculation of diluted earnings per share, net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders for basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is adjusted by the effect of dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding, including all potentially dilutive common shares. In periods of loss, there are no potentially dilutive common shares to add to the\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The undistributed earnings or losses are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A, Class B, Class C\nand Class D common shares as if the earnings or losses for the year have been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings or losses are\nallocated on a proportionate basis, and as such, diluted and basic earnings per share is the same for each class of common stock under the two-class method.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (in thousands, except share and per share data):\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D stockholders $ 2,050 $ 34,343\nDenominator:\nDenominator for basic net income per share - weighted average outstanding shares 47,645,678 48,928,063\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options and restricted stock 2,598,132 3,246,274\nDenominator for diluted net income per share - weighted-average outstanding shares 50,243,810 52,174,337\nNet income attributable to Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D stockholders per share – basic $ 0.04 $ 0.70\nNet income attributable to Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D stockholders per share – diluted $ 0.04 $ 0.66\nThere were no material potentially antidilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nF-23\nTable of Contents\n(n) Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company reports the financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis under the provisions of ASC 820, “Fair Value\nMeasurement” (“ASC 820”) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nThe fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1\nprovides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than those included in Level 1 (i.e., quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or\nliabilities in inactive markets).\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value instrument.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are categorized as\nfollows:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(In thousands)\nAs of December 31, 2023\nLiabilities subject to fair value measurement:\nEmployment Agreement Award (a) $ 22,970 $ — $ — $ 22,970\nMezzanine equity subject to fair value measurement:\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests (b) $ 16,520 $ — $ — $ 16,520\nAssets subject to fair value measurement:\nCash equivalents - money market funds (d) $ 193,769 $ 193,769 $ — $ —\nAs of December 31, 2022\nLiabilities subject to fair value measurement:\nEmployment Agreement Award (a) $ 25,741 $ — $ — $ 25,741\nMezzanine equity subject to fair value measurement:\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests (b) $ 25,298 $ — $ — $ 25,298\nAssets subject to fair value measurement:\nAvailable-for-sale securities (c) $ 136,826 $ — $ — $ 136,826\nCash equivalents - money market funds (d) 39,798 39,798 — —\nTotal $ 176,624 $ 39,798 $ — $ 136,826\n(a) Pursuant to an employment agreement, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is eligible to receive an award (the “Employment Agreement Award”) amount equal to approximately\n4% of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of the Company’s aggregate investment in TV One. The Company reviews the factors\nunderlying this award at the end of each reporting period including the valuation of TV One (based on the\nF-24\nTable of Contents\nestimated enterprise fair value of TV One as determined by the income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis and the market approach using comparable public company\nmultiples). Significant inputs to the discounted cash flow analysis include revenue growth rates, future operating profit, and discount rate. Significant inputs to the market approach\ninclude publicly held peer companies and recurring EBITDA multiples. Please refer to Note 16 – Subsequent Events of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for more\ndetails.\n(b) The redeemable noncontrolling interests in Reach Media are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology as of December 31, 2022. Significant inputs to the\ndiscounted cash flow analysis include revenue growth rates, future operating profit margins, and discount rate. As of December 31, 2023 the fair value is measured using an exit price\nmethodology. Significant inputs to the exit price analysis include revenue growth rates, future operating profit margins, discount rate and an exit multiple.\n(c) During the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its MGM Investment. The investment in MGM National Harbor was preferred stock that had a\nnon-transferable put right and is classified as an available-for-sale debt security. The investment was initially measured at fair value using a dividend discount model. Significant\ninputs to the dividend discount model included revenue growth rates, discount rate and a terminal growth rate. At December 31, 2022, the investment’s fair value was measured using\na contractual valuation approach. This method relied on a contractually agreed upon formula established between the Company and MGM National Harbor as defined in the Second\nAmended and Restated Operating Agreement of MGM National Harbor, LLC (“the Agreement”) rather than market-based inputs or traditional valuation methods. As defined in the\nAgreement, the calculation of the put was based on operating results, Enterprise Value and the Put Price Multiple. The inputs used in this measurement technique were specific to the\nentity, MGM National Harbor, and there are no current observable prices for investments in private companies that are comparable to MGM National Harbor. The inputs used to\nmeasure the fair value of this security were classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. Throughout the periods from the fourth quarter of 2020 up until the third quarter of\n2022, the Company relied on the dividend discount model for valuation purposes based on the facts, circumstances, and information available at the time. During the fourth quarter of\n2022, the Company adopted the contractual valuation method described above as it believes it more closely approximates the fair value of the investment at that time.\n(d) The Company measures and reports its cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds and valued based on quoted market prices which approximate cost due to their short-\nterm maturities.\nThere were no transfers in or out of Level 1, 2, or 3 during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The following table presents the changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nEmployment Redeemable Available-\nAgreement Noncontrolling for-Sale\nAward Interests Securities\nBalance at December 31, 2021 $ 28,193 $ 18,655 $ 112,600\nNet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests — 2,626 —\nDividends paid to redeemable noncontrolling interests — (1,599) —\nDistribution (4,039) — —\nChange in fair value included within other comprehensive income — — 24,226\nChange in fair value (*) 1,587 5,616 —\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 25,741 $ 25,298 $ 136,826\nNet income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests — 2,530 —\nDividends paid to redeemable noncontrolling interests — (4,401) —\nDistribution (2,940) — —\nSale of available-for-sale securities — — (136,826)\nChange in fair value (*) 169 (6,907) —\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 22,970 $ 16,520 $ —\nF-25\nTable of Contents\n(*) Amount of total losses for the period included in earnings attributable to the change in unrealized losses relating to assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date.\nChanges in the fair value of the Employment Agreement Award were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as corporate selling, general and administrative expenses\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFor Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows:\nAs of As of\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nSignificant\nUnobservable Significant Unobservable\nLevel 3 liabilities Valuation Technique Inputs Input Value\nEmployment Agreement Award Discounted cash flow Discount rate 10.0% 10.5%\nEmployment Agreement Award Discounted cash flow Operating profit margin range 35.0% - 42.3% 33.7% - 46.6%\nEmployment Agreement Award Discounted cash flow Revenue growth rate range (2.1)% - 2.5% (4.1)% - 4.2%\nEmployment Agreement Award Market Approach Average recurring EBITDA multiple 6.3 - 6.5x 6.6x\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests Discounted cash flow Discount rate 12.5% 11.5%\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests Discounted cash flow Operating profit margin range 24.5% - 31.9% 25.8% - 29.8%\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests Discounted cash flow Revenue growth rate range 1.2% - 16.5% 0.2% - 32.2%\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests Discounted cash flow Exit Multiple 4.0x N/A\nAny significant increases or decreases in unobservable inputs could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.\nChanges in fair value measurements, if significant, may affect the Company’s performance of cash flows.\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis using Level 3 inputs as defined in ASC 820. These assets are not measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. Included in this category are goodwill, radio broadcasting licenses and other intangible assets, net,\nthat are written down to fair value when they are determined to be impaired, as well as content assets that are periodically written down to net realizable value.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the total recorded carrying values of goodwill and radio broadcasting licenses were approximately $216.6 million and $375.3 million, respectively. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges of approximately $129.3 million associated with certain radio broadcasting licenses.\n(o) Software and Web Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes direct internal and external costs incurred to develop internal-use computer software during the application development stage. Internal-use software is\namortized under the straight-line method using an estimated life of three years.\n(p) Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests are interests held by third parties in the Company’s subsidiaries that are redeemable outside of the Company’s control either for cash or other\nassets. These interests are classified as mezzanine equity and measured at the greater of estimated redemption value at the end of each reporting period or the historical cost basis of the\nnoncontrolling interests adjusted for cumulative earnings allocations. The resulting increases or decreases in the estimated redemption amount are affected by corresponding charges\nagainst retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in-capital.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\n(q) Investments\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nOn April 10, 2015, the Company made a $5.0 million investment in MGM’s world-class casino property, MGM National Harbor, LLC (“MGMNH” or “MGM National Harbor”)\nlocated in Prince George’s County, Maryland, which has a predominately African-American demographic profile. On November 30, 2016, the Company contributed an additional $35.0\nmillion to complete its investment. In return for this investment, the Company received preferred stock and a non-transferable put right, exercisable for a thirty-day period each year. The\nprice of the put right was determined based on the “Put Price” definition as defined in the agreement between the Company and MGM National Harbor.\nThe Company classified its investment in MGM National Harbor as an available-for-sale debt security. Investments classified as available-for-sale were carried at fair value with\nunrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Net realized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale securities, and\nunrealized losses considered to be other-than-temporary, are recorded to other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn March 8, 2023, Radio One Entertainment Holdings, LLC (“ROEH”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, issued a put notice (the “Put Notice”) with respect to one\nhundred percent (100%) of its interest (the “Put Interest”) in MGMNH. On April 21, 2023, ROEH closed on the sale of the Put Interest and the Company received approximately $136.8\nmillion in proceeds from the sale of the available-for-sale debt security and recognized a pre-tax gain of $96.8 million, which is included in other income, net on the consolidated\nstatements of operations. The cost of the available for sale security sold was determined using the specific identification method.\nThe investment entitled the Company to an annual cash distribution based on net gaming revenue. As the Company exercised its Put Interest in March 2023, the Company did not\nhave any distribution income for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company recognized approximately $8.8 million in distribution income, which is included in other income, net\non the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe amortized cost, estimated fair value, and gains and losses on the debt security classified as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized as follows:\nAmortized Gross Gross Gross\nCost Unrealized Unrealized Realized Fair\nBasis Gains Losses Gains Value\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31, 2023\nMGM Investment $ — $ — $ — $ 96,826 $ —\nDecember 31, 2022\nMGM Investment $ 40,000 $ 104,326 $ (7,500) $ — $ 136,826\nRVA Entertainment Holding\nIn 2021, the Company and Peninsula Pacific Entertainment (succeeded by Churchill Downs Incorporated (“CDI”) on November 1, 2022) formed a joint venture, RVAEH, to develop\nand operate a casino resort in Richmond. At the time, the Company owned 75% of the joint venture and met the requirements to consolidate the joint venture under the VIE method as the\nCompany had control to direct the activities of RVAEH and the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to RVAEH. The investment\nincluded a put right allowing the noncontrolling interest holder the option to require the Company to purchase all shares of the noncontrolling interest holder starting 10 years after\nreaching a certain milestone. Therefore, the put rights were required to be presented as mezzanine equity and were recorded at cost, adjusted for the noncontrolling interests in the net loss\nof RVAEH. When the redemption or carrying value is less than the recorded redemption value, the Company adjusts the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the redemption value\nwith changes recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings, or in the absence of retained earnings,\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nadditional paid-in-capital. Any such adjustment, when necessary, will be performed as of the applicable balance sheet date. RVAEH’s redeemable noncontrolling interests on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 were $6.6 million.\nOn February 14, 2023, CDI purchased 25% of the Company’s investment in RVAEH for $6.6 million, bringing both the Company’s and CDI’s ownership interests to 50%. On this\ndate, the Company’s share of voting power and its share of board rights was reduced, causing the Company to no longer be the primary beneficiary of RVAEH, and therefore no longer\nmeeting the requirements for consolidation. The Company deconsolidated RVAEH’s assets, liabilities, and redeemable noncontrolling interest, and, using CDI’s cash payment for 25% of\nRVAEH to calculate the fair value of the joint venture, recognized a $0.2 million loss in other income, net on the consolidated statements of operations. At this point, the Company began\naccounting for its interest in the joint venture using the equity method. Under the equity method, the initial investment is recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Company’s\nproportionate share of net income or losses, cash contributions made and distributions received, and other adjustments, as appropriate. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the\nCompany received $13.0 million in cash, which was released from escrow. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of the Company’s investment in unconsolidated joint ventures\non the consolidated balance sheet was $0.0 million. Additionally, the Company is committed to fund $0.2 million related to losses that exceeded the carrying value of the investment and\nis included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s proportionate share of net loss is included in loss from unconsolidated joint venture on the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n(r) Content Assets\nThe Company’s cable television segment has entered into contracts to license entertainment programming rights and programs from distributors and producers. The license periods\ngranted in these contracts generally run from one year to five years. Contract payments are typically made in quarterly installments over the terms of the contract period. Each contract is\nrecorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross contractual commitment when the license period begins, and the program is available for its first airing. The Company\nalso has programming for which the Company has engaged third parties to develop and produce, and it owns most or all rights (commissioned programming). For programming that is\npredominantly monetized as part of a content group, such as the Company’s commissioned programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the Company’s usage and\nbenefit from such programming. The estimates require management’s judgment and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the\nexpected number of future airings, among other factors. The Company’s acquired programs’ capitalized costs are amortized based on projected usage, generally resulting in an\namortization pattern that is the greater of straight-line or projected usage.\nThe Company utilizes judgment and prepares analyses to determine the amortization patterns of the Company’s content assets. Key assumptions include the categorization of content\nbased on shared characteristics and the use of a quantitative model to predict revenue. For each grouping of assets with similar characteristics, which the Company defines as genre, this\nmodel takes into account projected viewership which is based on (i) estimated household universe; (ii) ratings; and (iii) expected number of airings across different broadcast time slots.\nAs part of the Company's assessment of its amortization rates, the Company compares the estimated amortization rates to those that have been utilized during the year. Management\nregularly reviews, and revises, when necessary, its total revenue estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization and/or a write down of the asset to fair value. Based on\nthe expected pattern of benefit from the content, the Company applies either an accelerated method or a straight-line amortization method over the estimated useful lives of generally one\nto five years.\nContent that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and is tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair\nvalue of the content within the film group is less than its unamortized costs. The Company evaluates the fair value of content at the film group level by considering expected future\nrevenue generation using a cash flow analysis when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less\nthan unamortized costs. Estimates of future revenues consider historical airing patterns and future plans for airing content, including any changes in strategy. Given the significant\nestimates and judgments involved, actual demand or market conditions may be less favorable than those projected,\nF-28\nTable of Contents\nrequiring a write-down to fair value. The Company determined there were no impairment indicators during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Impairment and amortization of\ncontent assets are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as programming and technical expenses. All commissioned and licensed content is classified as a long-term asset,\nexcept for the portion of the unamortized content balance that is expected to be amortized within one year which is classified as a current asset.\nTax incentives offered by state governments are measured based on production activities and are recorded as a reduction to capitalized production costs.\n(s) Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13. ASU 2016-13 is intended to provide financial statement users with more decision useful information about the expected credit losses\non financial instruments and other commitments and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. In November\n2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842)”: Effective Dates which\ndeferred the effective date of credit loss standard ASU 2016-13 by two years for smaller reporting companies and permits early adoption. ASU 2016-13 became effective for the\nCompany beginning January 1, 2023.\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2023 using a modified retrospective transition method, which requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening\nretained earnings in the consolidated balance sheet to be recognized on the date of adoption without restating prior years. The cumulative-effect adjustment on January 1, 2023 was $0.6\nmillion.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting” to provide\noptional relief from applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the anticipated transition away from LIBOR. As a result of the\nreference rate reform initiative, certain widely used rates such as LIBOR are expected to be discontinued. The Company holds the ABL Facility, which now bears interest based on the\nSOFR rate, having formerly been subject to the LIBOR rate. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic\n848, to defer the sunset date of the temporary relief in Topic 848 to December 31, 2024. The guidance became effective upon issuance. The adoption of ASU 2022-06 did not have an\nimpact on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combination (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers”,\nwhich requires an acquirer to recognize and measure contract assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic\n606), rather than adjust them to fair value at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2023 and applies to acquisitions occurring after the\neffective date. The new guidance had no impact to the consolidated financial statements during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to\nReportable Segment Disclosures”, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim\nperiods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of\nthe Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to\ndetermine its reportable segments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2024, with early adoption permitted. A public entity should apply the amendments in this ASU retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company\nexpects this ASU to only impact the disclosures with no impacts to the results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income\ntaxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business\nF-29\nTable of Contents\nentity (PBE) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items\nfurther broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds\nreceived disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new\nstandard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing\nthe revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by\nproviding the revised disclosures for all period presented. The Company expects this ASU to only impact the disclosures with no impacts to the results of operations, cash flows and\nfinancial condition.\n(t) Related Party Transactions\nReach Media operates the Tom Joyner Foundation’s Fantastic Voyage® (the “Fantastic Voyage®”), an annual fund-raising event, on behalf of the Tom Joyner Foundation, Inc. (the\n“Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) entity. The agreement under which the Fantastic Voyage® operates provides that Reach Media provide all necessary operations of the cruise, and that Reach\nMedia will be reimbursed its expenditures and receive a fee plus a performance bonus. Reach Media bears the risk should the Fantastic Voyage® sustain a loss and bears all credit risk\nassociated with the related passenger cruise package sales. The agreement between Reach Media and the Foundation automatically renews annually. The agreement may be terminated\nby: mutual agreement; by one of the parties should its financial requirements not be met; or if a party is in breach by the non-breaching party, which shall have the right, but not the\nobligation, to terminate unilaterally. The Foundation owed Reach Media approximately $1.0 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nReach Media provides office facilities (including office space, telecommunications facilities, and office equipment) to the Foundation. Such services are provided to the Foundation\non a pass-through basis at cost. Additionally, from time to time, the Foundation reimburses Reach Media for expenditures paid on its behalf at Reach Media-related events. Under these\narrangements, the Foundation owed immaterial amounts to Reach Media as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nFantastic Voyage 2023 took place during the second quarter of 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, Reach Media's revenues, expenses, and operating income for the\nFantastic Voyage were approximately $9.7 million, $8.0 million, and $1.75 million, respectively. The Fantastic Voyage was not operated in 2022.\nAlfred C. Liggins, President and Chief Executive Officer, (“CEO”) of Urban One, Inc., is a compensated member of the Board of Directors of Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), a\nperformance rights organization to which the Company pays license fees in the ordinary course of business. The company incurred expenses of approximately $3.2 million and $3.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company owed BMI approximately $0.3 million and $1.5 million,\nrespectively. Please refer to Note 16 – Subsequent Events of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for more details.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a receivable from its CEO in the amount of $0.2 million and $0.2 million, respectively, as reimbursement for payments made\nfor various perquisites and other personal benefits, including payments for taxes for past financial services and administrative support. The full amount of this receivable will be offset\nagainst the CEO’s bonus and/or directly reimbursed to the Company by the CEO.\nF-30\nTable of Contents\n(u) Leases\nThe Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. In determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the Company considers all relevant facts\nand circumstances, including whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The determination involves\njudgment with respect to whether the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the identified asset and whether the Company has the right\nto direct the use of the identified asset.\nRight of use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. ROU assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within\noperating expenses over the term of the lease.\nLease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Many of the Company’s leases provide options to extend\nthe terms of the agreements. Generally, renewal periods are excluded when calculating the lease liabilities as the Company does not consider exercise of such options to be reasonably\ncertain. When exercise of a renewal option is reasonably assured, the optional terms and related payments are included within lease liability calculation. The implicit rate within the\nCompany’s lease agreements is generally not determinable and as such, the Company’s collateralized incremental borrowing rate is used.\nCertain of the Company’s operating lease agreements include variable lease payments that are adjusted periodically based on an index and a rate, such as the Consumer Price Index\nor a market rental rate. The Company recognizes the effect of the payment changes as part of variable lease cost in the appropriate period which is accounted for separately from periodic\nstraight-line lease expense.\nFor leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, the Company elected the exemption from recording ROU assets and lease liabilities and recognizes lease payments on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for the purpose of calculating ROU assets and lease liabilities, to the extent\nthat the non-lease components are fixed.\nThe Company’s operating leases are for office space, studio space, broadcast towers, and transmitter facilities that expire over the next forty-nine years.\nThe following table sets forth the components of lease expense and the weighted average remaining lease term and the weighted average discount rate for the Company’s leases:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\n(Dollars In thousands)\nOperating lease cost (cost resulting from lease payments) $ 12,738 $ 12,822\nVariable lease cost (cost excluded from lease payments) 127 40\nTotal lease cost $ 12,865 $ 12,862\nOperating lease - operating cash flows (fixed payments) $ 13,761 $ 13,978\nOperating lease - operating cash flows (liability reduction) $ 10,362 $ 9,935\nWeighted average lease term - operating leases 5.94years 4.85years\nWeighted average discount rate - operating leases 11.66% 11.00%\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2023, maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, (In thousands)\n2024 $ 13,767\n2025 7,658\n2026 5,674\n2027 4,148\n2028 3,114\nThereafter 14,726\nTotal future lease payments 49,087\nLess: imputed interest (16,062)\nTotal future lease payments $ 33,025\n4. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS:\nOn April 11, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Cox Media Group (“the CMG Acquisition”) to purchase its Houston radio cluster. Under the\nterms of the agreement, the Company agreed to acquire 93Q Country KKBQ-FM, classic rock station The Eagle 106.9 & 107.5 KHPT-FM and KGLK-FM, and Country Legends 97.1\nKTHT-FM. The transaction price was $27.5 million. The acquisition was completed on August 1, 2023.\nAs part of the Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) approval of and the closing conditions of the CMG Acquisition, the Company was required to divest KTHT-FM. On\nJune 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Educational Media Foundation (“EMF”) to sell KTHT-FM, and all its assets, for $3.1 million (“the\nKTHT Divestiture”). Immediately prior to the closing of the CMG Acquisition on August 1, 2023, the KTHT-FM assets were transferred directly into an irrevocable trust until the sale to\nEMF was finalized. On November 1, 2023, after the approval by the FCC, the KTHT Divestiture was completed.\nThe Company accounted for the CMG Acquisition as an acquisition of assets and, as such, allocated the purchase price, including transaction costs directly related to the asset\nacquisition, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values with no goodwill recognized. The Company’s allocation of the purchase price to the assets\nacquired in the CMG Acquisition, exclusive of those amounts allocated to KTHT-FM, consisted of approximately $23.4 million to radio broadcasting licenses, $0.3 million to towers and\nantennas, $0.5 million to transmitters, $0.1 million to studios, approximately $0.1 million to fixed assets.\nTo determine the fair value of the FCC licenses, the Company utilized the income approach which values a license by calculating the value of a hypothetical start-up company that\ninitially has no assets except the asset to be valued (the FCC license).\nIn anticipation of the FCC divestiture requirement and the CMG Acquisition, the Company agreed to sell its KROI-FM radio broadcasting license along with the associated station\nassets from the radio broadcasting segment to an unrelated third party for approximately $7.5 million. The identified assets and liabilities of KROI-FM had a combined carrying value of\napproximately $9.9 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The major category of the assets included radio broadcasting licenses in the amount of approximately $7.3 million (net of\nimpairment of approximately $16.8 million included in impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets, on the consolidated statement of operations). On August 1, 2023,\nimmediately prior to the closing of the CMG Acquisition, the identified assets and liabilities were transferred to an irrevocable trust and removed from the Company’s consolidated\nbalance sheet as part of customary closing terms. The identified assets and liabilities will remain in the trust until the transaction is complete, which is anticipated to occur in 2024.\nAs the identified assets and liabilities of KROI-FM were held in an irrevocable trust and the divestiture had not been completed as of December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded\na right to receive payment from KROI-FM’s acquirer as a receivable of $5.6 million within other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nF-32\nTable of Contents\nOn June 13, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Emmis Communications (“Emmis”) to purchase its Indianapolis Radio Cluster to expand the\nCompany’s market presence. The deal was subject to FCC approval and other customary closing conditions and, after obtaining the approvals, closed on August 31, 2022. Urban One\nacquired radio stations WYXB (B105.7FM), WLHK (97.1FM), WIBC (93.1FM), translators W228CX and W298BB (The Fan 93.5FM and 107.5FM), and Network Indiana for $25.0\nmillion. As part of the transaction, the Company disposed of its former WHHH radio broadcasting license along with the intellectual property related to WNOW (there was a call letter\nchange from WHHH to WNOW immediately prior to the close) to a third party for approximately $3.2 million. The fair value of the assets disposed approximated the carrying value of\nthe assets. The Company recognized a net loss of approximately $0.1 million related to the disposal transaction during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company accounted for the Emmis transaction as a business combination. The Company’s purchase accounting to reflect the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed\nin the Emmis transaction consisted of approximately $23.6 million to radio broadcasting licenses, $0.2 million to towers and antennas, $0.3 million to transmitters, $0.2 million to studios,\n$0.1 million to fixed assets, $0.1 million to acquired advertising contracts, $0.4 million to goodwill, and $1.2 million to right of use assets and operating lease liabilities. The purchase\nprice allocation was finalized during fiscal year 2022, and no significant changes were recorded from the original estimation.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe table below sets forth unaudited pro forma results of operations, assuming that the Emmis acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2022\nNet revenue $ 496,613\nOperating income 91,767\nNet income 37,902\nThis pro forma financial information is based on historical results of operations, adjusted for the allocation of the purchase price and other accounting adjustments, and is not\nindicative of what the results would have been had the Company operated the stations acquired in the Emmis transaction for the period presented because the pro forma results do not\nreflect expected synergies. The pro forma adjustments primarily reflect depreciation expense and amortization of tangible and intangible assets related to the fair value adjustments of the\nassets acquired. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable to reflect the impact of this acquisition on the\nCompany’s historical financial information on a supplemental pro forma basis.\nF-33\nTable of Contents\n5. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT:\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the related estimated useful lives.

Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed\nas incurred.\n6. GOODWILL, RADIO BROADCASTING LICENSES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS:\nImpairment Assessment\nIn accordance with ASC 350, the Company does not amortize its radio broadcasting licenses or goodwill. Instead, the Company performs a test for impairment annually across all\nreporting units and radio broadcasting licenses, or on an interim basis when events or changes in circumstances or other conditions suggest impairment may have occurred. For\nbroadcasting licenses, the combined broadcasting licenses in each of the 13 radio markets represent a unit of accounting. For goodwill, the Company’s individual radio markets within the\nradio broadcasting segment and each of the other three business segments represent a reporting unit. Other intangible assets, except for unamortized brand names, continue to be\namortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The Company evaluates amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when circumstances indicate impairment may have\noccurred, using an undiscounted cash flow methodology. If the future undiscounted cash flows for the intangible asset are less than net book value, then the net book value is reduced to\nthe estimated fair value.\nThe Company performs an annual impairment assessment as of October 1 of each year. The Company identified interim triggering events during the current year which led to\nperforming impairment assessments including the most recent interim impairment test performed as of December 31, 2023.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded impairment losses against radio broadcasting licenses and goodwill collectively, of approximately $129.3\nmillion and $40.7 million, respectively, which are included within the impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations.\nF-34\nTable of Contents\nBroadcasting Licenses\nThe Company’s total broadcasting licenses carrying value is approximately $375.3 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe table below presents the changes in the Company’s radio broadcasting licenses during 2023 and 2022:\nTotal\n(In thousands)\nBalance at January 1, 2022 $ 501,420\nAcquisitions 23,642\nDisposals (3,200)\nImpairment charges (33,443)\nBalance at December 31, 2022 $ 488,419\nAcquisitions 23,431\nDisposals (7,276)\nImpairment charges (129,278)\nBalance at December 31, 2023 $ 375,296\nThe Company’s licenses expire at various dates through August 1, 2030. The FCC grants radio broadcast station licenses for specific periods of time and, upon application, may\nrenew them for additional terms. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. Under the\nCommunications Act, radio broadcast station licenses may be granted for a maximum term of eight years. The FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions,\nincluding renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted. Historically, the Company’s licenses have been renewed for a full eight-year terms without any conditions or\nsanctions; however, there can be no assurance that the licenses of each of the Company’s stations will be renewed for a full term without conditions or sanctions.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $16.8 million associated with the sale of the KROI-FM radio broadcasting license as\ndiscussed in Note 4 – Acquisitions and Dispositions of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Company performed an interim quantitative impairment assessment for broadcasting licenses in eight radio markets and recognized\nan impairment loss of approximately $22.1 million associated with broadcasting licenses in five radio markets. The primary factor leading to the impairments was a decline in the\nprojected gross market revenues.\nDuring the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company performed an interim quantitative impairment assessment for broadcasting licenses in all radio markets and\nrecognized an impairment loss of approximately $85.4 million associated with broadcasting licenses in 10 radio markets. The primary factor leading to the impairments was a decline in\nthe projected gross market revenues and an increase in the discount rate.\nAs of October 1, 2023, the Company performed a quantitative assessment for broadcasting licenses in all radio markets as part of the annual impairment assessment, resulting in no\nimpairment losses.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company performed an interim quantitative assessment for broadcasting licenses in all radio markets and recognized an\nimpairment loss of approximately $5.0 million associated with broadcasting licenses in three radio markets. The primary factor leading to the impairments was a decline in the projected\ngross market revenues and margins.\nWhen evaluating the Company’s radio broadcasting licenses for impairment, the assessment is done at the unit of accounting level. In the Company’s case, each unit of accounting is\na cluster of radio stations in one of the Company’s geographical markets. Broadcasting license fair values are based on the discounted future cash flows of the applicable unit of\naccounting assuming an initial hypothetical start-up operation which possesses FCC licenses as the only asset. Over\nF-35\nTable of Contents\ntime, it is assumed the operation acquires other tangible assets such as advertising and programming contracts, employment agreements and going concern value, and matures into an\naverage performing operation in a specific radio market.\nThe Company’s methodology for valuing broadcasting licenses has been consistent for all periods presented. Below are some of the key assumptions used in the income approach for\nestimating the broadcasting license fair values for the annual impairment assessment performed and interim impairment assessment where an impairment charge was recorded as a result\nof quantitative assessments since January 1, 2022.\nRadio Broadcasting December 31, October 1, September 30, June 30, March 31, October 1, September 30, June 30,\nLicenses 2023 2023 2023 2023 (a) 2023 2022 2022 (a) 2022 (a)\nImpairment charge (in millions) $ 5.0 $ — $ 85.4 $ 22.1 $ 16.8(*)$ 7.4 $ 15.5 $ 10.6(*)\nDiscount rate 9.5 – 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 9.5% (**) 9.5% 9.5% 9.5%\nRevenue growth rate range (2.3) % – 0.8% (1.7) % – 0.0% (1.7) % – 0.0% 0.3 % – 1.4% (**) 0.0 % – 1.7% 0.3 % – 1.6% 0.7 % – 2.4%\nTerminal growth rate range (0.5)% (0.5)% (0.5)% 0.3 % – 0.8% (**) 0.3 % – 0.8% 0.3 % – 0.8% 0.7 % – 1.0%\nMature market share range 5.2 % – 30.0% 5.3 % – 29.5% 5.3 % – 29.5% 0.9 % – 28.8% (**) 6.8 % – 27.6% 6.8 % – 27.6% 6.9 % – 25.6%\nOperating profit margin range 17.0 % – 31.9% 17.0 % – 33.5% 17.0 % – 33.5% 18.8 % – 34.6% (**) 27.2 % – 34.6% 28.3 % – 36.1% 28.3 % – 36.1%\n(a) Key assumptions presented on the table for these periods relate to certain markets that were quantitatively assessed as part of the interim impairment assessments.\n(*) Includes an impairment charge whereby the license fair value is based on estimated asset sale consideration.\n(**) As fair value is based on estimated asset sale consideration, key assumptions under the income approach are not applicable.\nIf actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by the Company or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of the Company’s\nbroadcast licenses below the carrying value, the Company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future periods. Such a charge could have a material effect on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements. The Company will continue to monitor potential triggering events and perform the appropriate analysis when deemed necessary.\nF-36\nTable of Contents\nGoodwill\nThe Company’s total goodwill carrying value is approximately $216.6 million as of December 31, 2023.

The key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis for goodwill include revenue and projected revenue growth\nrates by market, operating profit margins, terminal growth rate, and discount rate. Based on the assessments, there was no impairment in goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $4.3 million associated with goodwill in the Atlanta reporting unit.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2022, the\nF-37\nTable of Contents\nCompany recognized an impairment loss of approximately $2.9 million associated with goodwill in the Philadelphia reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets Excluding Goodwill and Radio Broadcasting Licenses\nOther intangible assets, excluding goodwill, radio broadcasting licenses and the unamortized brand name, are being amortized on a straight-line basis over various periods.

The 2028 Notes\nmature on February 1, 2028 and interest on the 2028 Notes accrues and is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year at a rate of 7.375% per annum.\nThe 2028 Notes and the guarantees are secured, subject to permitted liens and except for certain excluded assets (i) on a first priority basis by substantially all of the Company’s and\nthe Guarantors’ current and future property and assets (other than accounts receivable, cash, deposit accounts, other bank accounts, securities accounts, inventory and related assets that\nsecure the Company’s asset-backed revolving credit facility on a first priority basis (the “ABL Priority Collateral”)), including the capital stock of each guarantor (collectively, the “Notes\nPriority Collateral”) and (ii) on a second priority basis by the ABL Priority Collateral. The 2028 Notes require the Company to file quarterly and annual reports with the SEC within a\nspecified time period after the Company’s filing deadlines. However, failure to comply does not constitute an event of default unless the Company does not comply within 120 days after\nreceiving written notice from the Trustee. The Company has not received any such notice.\nThe associated debt issuance costs in the amount of approximately $15.4 million are reflected as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt obligations and amortized to\ninterest expense over the term of the credit facility using the effective interest rate method. The amortization of deferred financing costs is charged to interest expense for all periods\npresented.\nThe amount of deferred financing costs included in interest expense for all instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was approximately $2.1 million and $2.0\nmillion, respectively. The Company’s effective interest rate was 7.62% for 2023 and was 7.84% for 2022.\nOn December 6, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized and approved a note repurchase program for up to $25.0 million of the currently outstanding 2028 Notes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased approximately $25.0 million of its 2028 Notes at an average price of approximately 89.1% of par. The\nCompany recorded a net gain on retirement of debt of approximately $2.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased approximately $75.0 million of its 2028 Notes at an average price of approximately 89.5% of par. The\nCompany recorded a net gain on retirement of debt of approximately $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe Company conducts a portion of its business through its subsidiaries. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the Company’s 2028\nNotes.\nPPP Loan\nOn January 29, 2021, the Company submitted an application for participation in the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program loan program (“PPP”) and on June 1, 2021, the\nCompany received proceeds of approximately $7.5 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the PPP loan and related accrued interest was forgiven and recorded as other\nincome in the amount of $7.6 million. Prior to being forgiven, the loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 1% per year was scheduled to mature June 1, 2026.\nAsset-Backed Credit Facilities\nOn February 19, 2021, the Company closed on its asset backed credit facility (the “Current ABL Facility”). The Current ABL Facility is governed by a credit agreement by and\namong the Company, the other borrowers party thereto, the lenders party thereto from time to time and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Current ABL Facility\nprovides for up to $50.0 million revolving loan borrowings to provide for the working capital needs and general corporate requirements of the Company. The Current ABL Facility also\nprovides for a letter of credit facility up to $5.0 million as a\nF-41\nTable of Contents\npart of the overall $50.0 million in capacity. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there is no balance outstanding on the Current ABL Facility.\nAt the Company’s election, the interest rate on borrowings under the Current ABL Facility are based on either (i) the then applicable margin relative to Base Rate Loans (as defined\nin the Current ABL Facility) or (ii) until execution of the Waiver and Amendment (as defined below) took effect, the then applicable margin relative to LIBOR Loans (as defined in the\nCurrent ABL Facility) corresponding to the average availability of the Company for the most recently completed fiscal quarter.\nAdvances under the Current ABL Facility are limited to (a) eighty-five percent (85%) of the amount of Eligible Accounts (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), less the amount, if\nany, of the Dilution Reserve (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), minus (b) the sum of (i) the Bank Product Reserve (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), plus (ii) the AP and\nDeferred Revenue Reserve (as defined in the Current ABL Facility), plus (iii) without duplication, the aggregate amount of all other reserves, if any, established by Administrative Agent.\nAll obligations under the Current ABL Facility are secured by a first priority lien on all (i) deposit accounts (related to accounts receivable), (ii) accounts receivable, and (iii) all other\nproperty which constitutes ABL Priority Collateral (as defined in the Current ABL Facility). The obligations are also guaranteed by all material restricted subsidiaries of the Company.\nThe Current ABL Facility includes a covenant requiring the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement, to not be less than 1.00 to 1.00. The Company is in\ncompliance as of December 31, 2023.\nOn April 30, 2023, the Company entered into a waiver and amendment (the “Waiver and Amendment”) to the Current ABL Facility. The Waiver and Amendment waived certain\nevents of default under the Current ABL Facility related to the Company’s failure to timely deliver certain annual financial deliverables for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022 as\nrequired under the Current ABL Facility (the “Specified Defaults”).\nAdditionally, under the Waiver and Amendment, the Current ABL Facility was amended to provide that from and after the date thereof, any request for a new LIBOR Loan (as\ndefined in the Current ABL Facility), for a continuation of an existing LIBOR Loan (as defined in the Current ABL Facility) or for a conversion of a Loan to a LIBOR Loan (as defined\nin the Current ABL Facility) shall be deemed to be a request for a loan bearing interest at Term SOFR (as defined in the Amended Current ABL Facility) (the “SOFR Interest Rate\nChange”). As the Company was undrawn under the Current ABL Facility as of the date of the Waiver and Amendment, the SOFR Interest Rate Change would only bear upon future\nborrowings by the Company such that they bear an interest rate relating to the secured overnight financing rate. These provisions of the Waiver and Amendment are intended to transition\nloans under the Current ABL Facility to the new secured overnight financing rate as the benchmark rate.\nBetween June 5, 2023 and November 9, 2023, the Company entered into four more waiver and amendments related to the Company’s failure to timely deliver both the annual\nfinancial deliverables for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2022 and quarterly financial deliverables for the quarters ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 as\nrequired under the Current ABL Facility, dated as of February 19, 2021. On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into a fifth waiver and amendment (the “Fifth Waiver and\nAmendment”) to the Current ABL Facility, dated as of February 19, 2021. The Fifth Waiver and Amendment waived certain events of default under the Current ABL Facility related to\nthe Company’s failure to timely deliver the delayed reports. The Fifth Waiver and Amendment set a due date of November 30, 2023 for the quarterly financial deliverables for the\nquarters ended March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023 and a due date of December 31, 2023 for the quarterly financial deliverables for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note\n16 – Subsequent Events of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for further background on the Sixth Waiver and Amendment and the Seventh Waiver and Amendment, each\nexecuted after the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Current ABL Facility matures on the earlier to occur of (a) the date that is five years from the effective date of the Current ABL Facility, and (b) 91 days prior to the maturity of\nthe Company’s 2028 Notes.\nThe Current ABL Facility is subject to the terms of the Revolver Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in the Current ABL Facility) by and among the Administrative Agent and\nWilmington Trust, National Association.\nF-42\nTable of Contents\nLetter of Credit Facility\nThe Company has a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement with capacity of up to $1.2 million which expires on October 8, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had letters of credit totaling $0.8 million under the agreement for certain operating leases and certain insurance policies. Letters of credit issued under the agreement are\nrequired to be collateralized with cash. In addition, the Current ABL Facility provides for letter of credit capacity of up to $5.0 million subject to certain limitations on availability.\nFuture Minimum Principal Payments\nFuture scheduled minimum principal payments of debt as of December 31, 2023, were as follows:\n7.375% Senior\nSecured Notes due\nFebruary 2028\n(In thousands)\n2024 $ —\n2025 —\n2026 —\n2027 —\n2028 725,000\n2029 and thereafter —\nTotal debt $ 725,000\n11.

Major components of the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2023 and\n2022 are related to net operating loss limitations, net operating loss expirations, interest carryforwards, impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets, limitation of\nofficer's compensation under IRC Section 162(m), uncertain tax positions, state income taxes, and non-taxable PPP loan income forgiveness for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nF-43\nTable of Contents\nThe components of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations are as follows:\nFor the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nFederal:\nCurrent $ — $ —\nDeferred 3,952 12,572\nState:\nCurrent 2,796 1,844\nDeferred 1,196 2,002\nProvision for income taxes $ 7,944 $ 16,418\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for tax\npurposes. Deferred taxes are based on tax laws as currently enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is not\nmore likely than not that the Company will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. The significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as\nfollows:\nAs of December 31,\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $ 2,084 $ 2,149\nAccruals 2,722 304\nFixed assets — 493\nStock-based compensation 615 521\nNet operating loss carryforwards 57,428 89,377\nLease liability 8,084 8,901\nInterest expense carryforward 21,977 23,788\nTotal deferred tax assets 92,910 125,533\nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets (1,473) (30)\nTotal deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance 91,437 125,503\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIntangible assets (102,233) (129,026)\nAvailable-for-sale securities — (23,779)\nFixed assets (873) —\nRight of use asset (7,748) (8,123)\nPartnership interests (283) (2,412)\nDeferred financing costs (734) (958)\nUncertain tax positions (397) (444)\nOther (107) (150)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities (112,375) (164,892)\nNet deferred tax liability $ (20,938) $ (39,389)\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had pre-tax federal and state NOL carryforward amounts of approximately $386.7 million and $285.4 million, respectively. Certain of the\nfederal and state NOLs are subject to annual limitations under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Additionally, the amount of the state NOLs may change if future apportionment factors\ndiffer from current factors. The Company continues to assess potential tax strategies, which if successful, may reduce the impact of the annual limitations and potentially recover NOLs\nthat otherwise would expire before being applied to reduce future income tax liabilities. If successful, the Company may be able to recover additional federal and state NOLs\nF-44\nTable of Contents\nin future periods, which could be material. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that the Company will be able to realize additional federal and state NOLs, the tax\nbenefit could materially impact future quarterly and annual periods. However, if these potential tax strategies do not meet the more likely than not threshold, the Company may claim\nthese additional NOLs as unrecognized tax benefits. The federal and state NOLs expire in various years from 2024 to 2039.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the gross deferred tax assets of approximately $92.9 million were primarily the result of federal and state net operating losses and the IRC Section 163(j)\ninterest expense carryforward. A valuation allowance of $1.5 million and $30,000 was recorded against the Company’s gross deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and is related to state jurisdictions where it is not more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe assessment to determine the value of the deferred tax assets to be realized under ASC 740 is highly judgmental and requires the consideration of all available positive and\nnegative evidence in evaluating the likelihood of realizing the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets in a future period. Circumstances may change over time such that previous negative\nevidence no longer exists, and new conditions should be evaluated as positive or negative evidence that could affect the realization of the deferred tax assets. Since the evaluation requires\nconsideration of events that may occur in some years in the future, significant judgment is required, and the Company’s conclusion could be materially different if certain expectations do\nnot materialize.\nRealization of the Company’s federal and state net operating losses is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods, and although the Company believes it is\nmore likely than not future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize most of the net operating losses, realization is not assured and future events may cause a change to the judgment of\nthe realizability of these deferred tax assets. If a future event causes the Company to re-evaluate and conclude that it is not more likely than not, that all or a portion of the deferred tax\nassets are realizable, the Company would be required to establish a valuation allowance against the assets at that time which would result in a charge to income tax expense and a decrease\nto net income in the period which the change of judgment is concluded.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n2023 2022\n(In thousands)\nBalance as of January 1 $ 654 $ 1,277\nDeductions for tax positions as a result of the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation (79) (623)\nBalance as of December 31 $ 575 $ 654\nThe nature of the uncertainties pertaining to the Company’s income taxes is primarily due to various state income tax positions that affect the amount of state NOLs available to be\napplied to reduce future state income tax liabilities, and prior year restatement adjustments that the Company has not yet amended on its 2022 income tax returns. The unrecognized tax\nbenefits liability accrued on the Company’s balance sheet decreased by $0.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, and $0.6 million during the year ended December 31,\n2022, respectively, primarily as a result of the lapse of statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $0.6 million,\nwhich if recognized, would reduce our net operating loss carryforward.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. There is no material amount of interest and penalties\nrecognized in the statement of operations and the balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that a decrease of up to\n$52,000 of unrecognized tax benefits related to state tax exposures may be necessary within the coming year.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions and is subject to examination by the various taxing authorities. The\nCompany’s open tax years for federal income tax\nF-45\nTable of Contents\nexaminations include the tax years ended December 31, 2020 through 2023. For state and local purposes, the open years for tax examinations include the tax years ended December 31,\n2019 through 2023. To the extent that net operating losses are utilized, the year of the loss may be subject to examination.\n12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:\nCommon Stock\nThe Company has four classes of common stock, Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D. Generally, the shares of each class are identical in all respects and entitle the holders thereof\nto the same rights and privileges. However, with respect to voting rights, each share of Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote and each share of Class B common stock\nentitles its holder to ten votes. The holders of Class C and Class D common stock are not entitled to vote on any matters. The holders of Class A common stock can convert such shares\ninto shares of Class C or Class D common stock. Subject to certain limitations, the holders of Class B common stock can convert such shares into shares of Class A common stock. The\nholders of Class C common stock can convert such shares into shares of Class A common stock. The holders of Class D common stock have no such conversion rights.\nStock Repurchase Program\nFrom time to time, the Board of Directors has authorized, and may authorize, repurchases of shares of the Company’s Class A and Class D common stock. Under the stock\nrepurchase program, the Company intends to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with\napplicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Under open authorizations, repurchases may be made from time\nto time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. shares are retired when repurchased. The timing and extent of any\nrepurchases will depend upon prevailing market conditions, the trading price of the Company’s Class A and/or Class D common stock and other factors, and subject to restrictions under\napplicable law. When in effect, the Company executes upon stock repurchase programs in a manner consistent with market conditions and the interests of the stockholders, including\nmaximizing stockholder value.\nOn March 7, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $25.0 million of the currently outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A\nand/or Class D common stock over a period of 24 months. On December 6, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to an additional\n$10.0 million of the currently outstanding shares of the Company’s Class A and/or Class D common stock. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company\nrepurchased 824 and 4,779,969 shares of Class D common stock in the amount of approximately $3,000 and $25.0 million at an average price of $3.99 and $5.24 per share. The Company\ndid not repurchase any shares of Class A common stock during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOn September 27, 2022, the Compensation Committee authorized the repurchase of up to $0.5 million worth of shares in the aggregate from employees who want to sell in\nconnection with the Company’s most recent employee stock grant. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company did not repurchase any shares of Class A or Class D stock\nunder this authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 13,577 shares of Class D common stock in the amount of $57,000 at an average price of\n$4.23 per share. Giving effect to the repurchases, the Company has approximately $0.4 million remaining under its most recent and open authorization. The Company did not repurchase\nany shares of Class A stock during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nIn addition, the Company has limited but ongoing authority to purchase shares of Class D common stock (in one or more transactions at any time there remain outstanding grants)\nunder the 2019 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (as defined below). This limited authority is used to satisfy any employee or other recipient tax obligations in connection with the\nexercise of an option or a share grant under the 2019 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, to the extent that the Company has capacity under its financing agreements (i.e., its current\ncredit facilities and indentures) (each a “Stock Vest Tax Repurchase”).\nF-46\nTable of Contents\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company executed Stock Vest Tax Repurchases of 312,448 shares of Class D Common Stock in the amount of\napproximately $1.6 million at an average price of $5.21 per share and 344,702 shares of Class D Common Stock in the amount of approximately $1.5 million at an average price of $4.29\nper share, respectively.\nStock Option and Restricted Stock Grant Plan\nThe Company’s 2019 stock option and restricted stock plan (“2019 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan”), currently in effect was approved by the stockholders at the Company’s\nannual meeting on May 21, 2019. The Board of Directors adopted, and on May 21, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved, the 2019 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan which\nwas funded with 5,500,000 shares of Class D Common Stock. On June 23, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an amendment of the Urban One 2019 Equity and\nPerformance Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares available for grant and to provide the grant of Class A as well as Class D shares. The amendment was approved by the\nCompany’s shareholders and added 5,519,575 shares of Class D shares and added 2,000,000 Class A shares. As of December 31, 2023, 2,111,305 shares of Class D common stock and\n1,250,000 shares of Class A common stock were available for grant under the 2019 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan. The Company settles stock options, net of tax, upon exercise\nby issuing stock.\nPursuant to the terms of the Company’s stock plan and subject to the Company’s insider trading policy, a portion of each recipient’s vested shares may be sold in the open market for\ntax purposes on or about the vesting dates.\nThe Company measures compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognizes the related expense over the service period for awards expected to\nvest. The restricted stock-based awards do not participate in dividends until fully vested. The fair value of restricted stock-based awards is based on the closing price of the Company’s\ncommon stock on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is determined using the BSM. Such fair value is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period, which is\ngenerally the vesting period, net of an estimated forfeitures rate, using the straight-line method. Estimating the number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to\nthe extent actual forfeitures differ substantially from the Company’s current estimates, amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimated number of stock\nawards expected to vest are revised. The Company considers many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including the types of awards, employee classification and historical\nexperience. Actual forfeitures may differ substantially from the Company’s current estimate.\nStock options generally vest over a period of one year and generally expire ten years from the grant date. Restricted stock generally vests over a period of one year.\nThe Company’s use of the BSM to calculate the fair value of stock-based awards incorporates various assumptions including volatility, expected life, and interest rates. For options\ngranted, the BSM determines: (i) the term by using the simplified “plain-vanilla” method as allowed under Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 110; (ii) a historical volatility over a\nperiod commensurate with the expected term, with the observation of the volatility on a daily basis; and (iii) a risk-free interest rate that was consistent with the expected term of the stock\noptions and based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nStock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was approximately $10.0 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Tax benefits from stock-based\ncompensation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $0.3 million.\nThe per share weighted-average fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $2.80 and $2.82, respectively.\nF-47\nTable of Contents\nThese fair values were derived using the BSM with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2023 2022\nAverage risk-free interest rate 4.18% 2.79%\nExpected dividend yield —% —%\nExpected lives 5.59 years 5.69 years\nExpected volatility 53.14% 79.92%\nTransactions and other information relating to stock options of Class D common stock for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are summarized below:\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining Aggregate\nNumber of Weighted-Average Contractual Term Intrinsic\nOptions Exercise Price (In Years) Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021 3,770,913 $ 2.18 5.68 $ 4,659,601\nGrants 884,061 4.22 — —\nExercised (60,240) 0.83 — 315,620\nForfeited/cancelled/expired/settled — — — —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022 4,594,734 $ 2.59 5.72 $ 5,871,492\nGrants 649,453 5.20 — —\nExercised — — — —\nForfeited/cancelled/expired/settled (20,051) 4.75 — —\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023(1) 5,224,136 2.90 5.28 $ 5,021,952\nVested and expected to vest at December 31, 2023 5,171,594 2.89 5.24 5,021,952\nUnvested at December 31, 2023 452,524 4.71 9.19 —\nExercisable at December 31, 2023 4,771,612 2.73 4.91 5,021,952\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between the Company’s stock closing price on the last day of trading during the year ended December 31,\n2023, and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares that would have been received by the holders of in-the-money options had all the option holders exercised their\noptions on December 31, 2023. This amount changes based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately $0.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to Class D stock options is expected to be\nrecognized over a weighted-average period of 10 months.

The Company’s radio\nbroadcasting licenses expire at various times beginning in October 2027 through August 1, 2030. Although the Company may apply to renew its radio broadcasting licenses, third parties\nmay challenge the Company’s renewal applications. The Company is not aware of any facts or circumstances that would prevent the Company from having its current licenses renewed.\nA station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application was filed and is pending, as is the case with respect to each of the\nCompany’s stations with licenses that have expired.\nRoyalty Agreements\nMusical works rights holders, generally songwriters and music publishers, have been traditionally represented by performing rights organizations, such as the American Society of\nComposers Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc (“BMI”) and SEASAC, Inc. (“SESAC”). The market for rights relating to musical works is changing\nF-49\nTable of Contents\nrapidly. Songwriters and music publishers have withdrawn from the traditional performing rights organizations (“PRO”), particularly ASCAP and BMI, and new entities, such as Global\nMusic Rights Inc. (“GMR”), have been formed to represent rights holders. These organizations negotiate fees with copyright users, collect royalties and distribute them to the rights\nholders. These licenses periodically come up for renewal, and as a result certain of the Company’s PRO licenses are currently the subject of renewal negotiations. The outcome of these\nrenewal negotiations could impact, and potentially increase, the Company’s music license fees. In addition, there is no guarantee that additional PROs will not emerge, which could\nimpact, and in some circumstances increase, the Company’s royalty rates and negotiation costs.\nThe Radio Music Licensing Committee (“RMLC”), of which the Company is a represented participant, has negotiated and entered into, on behalf of participating members, an\nInterim License Agreement with ASCAP effective January 1, 2022 and to remain in effect until the date on which the parties reach agreement as to, or there is court determination of, new\ninterim or final fees, terms, and conditions of a new license for the five year period commencing on January 1, 2022 and concluding on December 31, 2026. On February 7, 2022, the\nRMLC and GMR reached a settlement and achieved certain conditions which effectuate a four-year license to which the Company is a party for the period April 1, 2022 to March 31,\n2026. The license includes an optional three-year extended term that the Company may effectuate prior to the end of the initial term. The RMLC is negotiating with BMI and SESAC.\nLeases and Other Operating Contracts and Agreements\nThe Company has noncancelable operating leases for office space, studio space, broadcast towers and transmitter facilities that expire over the next 50 years. The Company’s leases\nfor broadcast facilities generally provide for a base rent plus real estate taxes and certain operating expenses related to the leases. Certain of the Company’s leases contain renewal\noptions, escalating payments over the life of the lease and rent concessions. The future rentals under non-cancelable leases as of December 31, 2023, are shown below.\nThe Company has other operating contracts and agreements including employment contracts, on-air talent contracts, severance obligations, retention bonuses, consulting agreements,\nequipment rental agreements, programming related agreements, and other general operating agreements that expire over the next five years. The amounts the Company is obligated to pay\nfor these agreements are shown below.\nOther\nOperating\nOperating Contracts\nLease and\nAgreements Agreements\n(In thousands)\nYears ending December 31:\n2024 $ 13,767 $ 88,778\n2025 7,658 37,108\n2026 5,674 14,991\n2027 4,148 4,983\n2028 3,114 3,560\n2029 and thereafter 14,726 9,615\nTotal $ 49,087 $ 159,035\nOf the total amount of other operating contracts and agreements included in the table above, approximately $106.0 million has not been recorded on the balance sheet as of December\n31, 2023, as it does not meet recognition criteria. Approximately $33.5 million relates to certain commitments for content agreements for the Company’s cable television segment,\napproximately $29.2 million relates to employment agreements, and the remainder relates to other programming, network and operating agreements. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany has entered into an operating lease for an office and studio space, that has not yet commenced and that has minimum lease payments of $1.3 million. This operating lease will\ncommence in the second quarter of 2024 with a lease term of 7.2 years.\nF-50\nTable of Contents\nReach Media Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, the noncontrolling interest shareholders of Reach Media have had an annual right to require Reach Media to purchase all or a portion of their shares at\nthe then current fair market value for such shares (the “Put Right”). This annual right is exercisable for a 30-day period beginning January 1 of each year. The purchase price for such\nshares may be paid in cash and/or registered Class D common stock of Urban One, at the discretion of Urban One. The noncontrolling interest shareholders of Reach Media exercised\n50% of their Put Right on January 26, 2024. Management, at this time, cannot reasonably determine the period when and if the remainder of the put right will be exercised by the\nnoncontrolling interest shareholders. Please refer to Note 16 – Subsequent Events of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for more details.\nLetters of Credit\nThe Company currently is under a letter of credit reimbursement and security agreement with capacity of up to $1.2 million which expires on October 8, 2024. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company had letters of credit totaling $0.8 million under the agreement for certain operating leases and certain insurance policies. Letters of credit issued under the agreement\nare required to be collateralized with cash. In addition, the Current ABL Facility provides for letter of credit capacity of up to $5.0 million subject to certain limitations on availability.\nOther Contingencies\nThe Company has been named as a defendant in several legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. It is management’s opinion, after consultation with its legal counsel,\nthat the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.\n15. SEGMENT INFORMATION:\nThe Company has four reportable segments: (i) radio broadcasting; (ii) Reach Media; (iii) digital; and (iv) cable television.

In connection with the vesting of these\nawards, the Company withheld a total of 367,302 shares to settle the recipients’ tax obligations.\nAs previously disclosed, throughout most of 2023, the Company was delinquent in its filings with the SEC. These delinquent filings caused the Company to be in violation of\nNASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c) (the “Periodic Filing Rule”) which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports. Due to this violation, the Company\nreceived a possible delisting notification from the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (“NASDAQ”). While the Company cured the delinquent filings within calendar year 2023, the Company\nwas required to present a compliance plan with NASDAQ. The plan included a timeline for the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2023 (the\n“Last 2023 Late Filing”). On December 22, 2023, the Company filed the Last 2023 Late Filing bringing the Company into compliance with the Periodic Filing Rule. On January 4, 2024,\nthe Company announced that it had received notice from NASDAQ confirming that it has regained compliance with the Periodic Filing Rule.\nOn April 8, 2024, the Company received a new letter (the \"First 2024 NASDAQ Notice\") from NASDAQ notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with the Periodic\nFiling Rule as a result of not having timely filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”).

Reach Media paid the noncontrolling interest shareholders approximately $7.6 million for the 10% interest.\nOn February 8, 2024, the sale of BMI to a shareholder group led by New Mountain Capital, LLC, was completed. Based on the Company's equity interest in BMI, the sale resulted in\ncash proceeds of $0.8 million.\nAs of February 15, 2024, Urban One, Inc. terminated its 50/50 partnership with Churchill Downs Incorporated that sought to develop a casino resort in the City of Richmond. The\nCompany continues to explore options within the gaming space.\nOn April 3, 2024, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Alfred C. Liggins, III, President and Chief Executive Officer, consistent with the terms approved by the\nCompany’s Compensation Committee and previously disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed October 3, 2022. The terms of the new employment agreements are effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2022 and a copy of the employment agreement is attached as an exhibit to that Current Report on Form 8-K filed April 9, 2024.\nOn April 12, 2024, the Company entered into the Sixth Waiver and Amendment to the Current ABL Facility, dated as of February 19, 2021 (as amended by the Waiver and\nAmendment, the “Amended Current ABL Facility”), with the Company, the Company’s subsidiaries guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders party\nthereto. The Sixth Waiver and Amendment waived certain events of default under the Current ABL Facility related to the Company’s failure to timely deliver both the Annual Financial\nDeliverables for the period ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Form 10-K”) and Quarterly Financial Deliverables for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 as required under the Current\nABL Facility (the “2024 Q1 Form 10-Q” and, together with the “2023 Form 10-K, the “Delayed Reports” ).

Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to\nissue additional capital stock, but those shares are not registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nGeneral Rights and Voting Rights - The Company has four classes of common stock, Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D. The shares of our Class A, Class B, Class C and\nClass D are collectively referred to as our Common Stock. Generally, the shares of each class are identical in all respects and entitle the holders thereof to the same rights and\nprivileges. However, with respect to voting rights, each share of Class A common stock entitles its holder to one vote and each share of Class B common stock entitles its holder to\nten votes. The holders of Class C and Class D common stock are not entitled to vote on any matters. The holders of Class A common stock can convert such shares into shares of\nClass C or Class D common stock. Subject to certain limitations, the holders of Class B common stock can convert such shares into shares of Class A common stock. The holders\nof Class C common stock can convert such shares into shares of Class A common stock. The holders of Class D common stock have no such conversion rights.\nDividends - As and when dividends are declared or paid with respect to shares of Common Stock, whether in cash, property or securities of the Corporation, the holders of\nClass A Common, the holders of Class B Common, the holders of Class C Common and the holders of Class D Common shall be entitled to receive such dividends pro rata at the\nsame rate per share for each such class of Common Stock; provided that, if such dividends are declared or paid in shares of Common Stock, such dividends may be paid only (i) in\nshares of Class D Common, or (ii) if holders of any class of Common Stock are to receive payment in shares of any class of Common Stock other than Class D Common, then\nholders of shares of each class of Common Stock must receive payment only in shares of such respective class of Common Stock.

STATEMENT OF POLICY TO DIRECTORS,\nOFFICERS AND KEY EMPLOYEES CONCERNING SECURITIES TRADING\nThe Board of Directors of Urban One, Inc. (the “Company”) believes that officers, directors and other members of management of the\nCompany should have a meaningful investment in the Company. As stockholders themselves, officers, directors and other members of management\nare more likely to represent the interests of other stockholders. Likewise, officers and other members of management may perform more effectively\nwith the incentive of stock options or stock ownership.\nHowever, from time to time, officers, directors and other members of management will be aware of information that could be material to a\nstockholder’s investment decision, but which in the best interests of the Company should not be disclosed until some later time. Hindsight can be\nremarkably acute, and an accusation can always be made that at any particular time a purchase or sale of securities by an insider was motivated by\nundisclosed favorable or unfavorable information. In such circumstances, the appearance of impropriety can be almost as problematic as an actual\nabuse, both to the Company and to the insider involved.\nThe Board of Directors has therefore determined that it would be useful to establish this policy for securities transactions by officers, directors\nand other key employees designated by management.\nFor purposes of this policy, “officer” means the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, General\nCounsel, and any vice-president in charge of a principal business unit or function or any other person who performs a policy-making function for the\nCompany.\nA. TRADING WINDOW AND EVENT SPECIFIC BLACKOUT PERIOD.\n1. Generally, except as set forth in this paragraph A and in paragraph B of this policy, officers, directors and key employees\ndesignated by management may buy or sell securities of the Company only during a “window period” commencing twenty-four (24) hours after\ngeneral public release of the Company’s annual or quarterly revenues and ending the thirty- fifth business day thereafter. This “window” may be closed\nearly or may not open if, in the judgment of the Company’s General Counsel (in consultation with others as necessary), there exists undisclosed\ninformation that would make trades by members of the Company’s management and directors inappropriate. An officer, director or designated key\nemployee who believes that special circumstances require him or her to trade outside the window period should consult with the Company’s General\nCounsel. There may be instances where the General Counsel may consult with the Company’s Audit Committee. Permission to trade outside the\nwindow period will be granted only where the circumstances are extenuating and there appears to be no significant risk that the trade may\nsubsequently be questioned.\n2. From time to time, an event may occur that is material to the Company and is known by only a few directors or executives.\nSo long as the event remains material and nonpublic, directors, officers, and such other persons as are designated by the General Counsel may not trade\nin the Company's securities. The existence of an event-specific blackout will not be announced, other than to those who are aware of the event giving\nrise to the blackout. If, however, a person whose trades are subject to pre-clearance requests permission to trade in the Company's securities during an\nevent-specific blackout, the General Counsel will inform the requester of the existence of a blackout period, without disclosing the reason for the\nblackout. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the General Counsel may disclose the reason for the blackout if requested to do so by a member of the Board\nof Directors. Any person made aware of the existence of an event-specific blackout should not disclose the existence of the blackout to any other\nperson. The failure of the General Counsel to designate a person as being subject to an event-specific blackout will not relieve that person of the\nobligation not to trade while aware of material nonpublic information.\n3. Exceptions to Window Period.\na. Option Exercises. Directors, officers and designated key employees may exercise options granted under the Company’s\nstock option plan(s) without restriction to any particular period. However, the subsequent sale of the stock acquired upon the exercise of options is\nsubject to all provisions of this policy.\nb. 10b5-1 Automatic Trading Programs. In addition, purchases or sales of the Company’s securities made pursuant to,\nand in compliance with, a written plan established by a director, officer or designated key employee that meets the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) (a “Plan”) may be made without restriction to any particular period provided\nthat (i) the Plan was established in good faith, in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1, at the time when such individual was not in\npossession of material nonpublic information about the Company and the Company was in an open window period and had not imposed any trading\nblackout period, and (ii) the Plan was reviewed by the Company prior to establishment, solely to confirm compliance with this policy and the\nsecurities laws. The Company shall be notified of any amendments to the Plan or the termination of the Plan.\nB. PRE-CLEARANCE OR ADVANCE NOTICE OF TRANSACTIONS. In addition to the requirements of paragraph A (Trading Window and\nEvent Specific Blackout Period) above, officers and directors may not engage in any transaction in the Company’s securities, including any purchase\nor sale in the open market, loan, pledge, or other transfer of beneficial ownership without first obtaining pre-clearance of the transaction from the\nCompany’s General Counsel at least two days in advance of the proposed transaction. The General Counsel will then determine whether the\ntransaction may proceed and, if so, will direct the Legal Department to assist in complying with the reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the\nExchange Act. Pre- cleared transactions not completed within seven business days shall require new pre-clearance under the provisions of this\nparagraph. The Company may, at its discretion, shorten such period of time. Advance notice of gifts or intent to exercise an outstanding stock option\nshall be given to the General Counsel. To the extent possible, advance notice of upcoming transactions effected pursuant to an established 10b5-1\nautomatic trading plan under paragraph A(3)(b) above\n2\nshall also be given to the General Counsel. Upon the completion of any transaction, the officer or director must immediately notify the appropriate\npersons as set forth in Section 3 of the Company’s Section 16 Compliance Program so that the Company may assist in the Section 16 reporting\nobligations.\nC. HEDGING AND MONETIZATION TRANSACTIONS. Certain forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and\nforward sale contracts, allow an employee to lock in much of the value of his or her stock holdings, often in exchange for all or part of the potential for\nupside appreciation in the stock. These transactions allow the director or employee to continue to own the covered securities, but without the full risks\nand rewards of ownership. When that occurs, the director or employee may no longer have the same objectives as the Company's other shareholders.\nTherefore, the Company strongly discourages you from engaging in such transactions. Any person wishing to enter into such an arrangement must first\npre-clear the proposed transaction with the Board of Directors. Any request for pre-clearance of a hedging or similar arrangement must be submitted\nto the Board of Directors at least two weeks prior to the proposed execution of documents evidencing the proposed transaction and must set forth a\njustification for the proposed transaction.\nD. COVERED INSIDERS. The provisions outlined in this policy apply to all officers and directors of the Company and to such other\nemployees of the Company as the General Counsel may designate from time to time because of their access to sensitive Company information.\nGenerally, any entities or family members whose trading activities are controlled or influenced by any of such persons should be considered to be\nsubject to the same restrictions.\nE. SHORT-SWING TRADING/SECTION 16 REPORTS. Officers and directors subject to the reporting obligations under Section 16 of the\nExchange Act should take care not to violate the prohibition on short-swing trading (Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act) and the restrictions on\nsales by control persons (Rule 144), and should file all appropriate Section 16 (a) reports (Forms 3, 4 and 5), all of which have been enumerated and\ndescribed in a separate Section 16 Compliance Memorandum.\nF. ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.

If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank,\nbroker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the “beneficial owner” of shares held in “street name,” and a\nnotice was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of\nrecord for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization\non how to vote the shares held in your account.

Other than in the election of directors, abstentions may be\nspecified on each proposal. Abstentions, instructions to withhold voting authority and broker non-votes are not deemed to\nbe votes cast and, accordingly, will have no effect on the outcome of the voting.\nQ:How do I change my proxy?\nYou may change or revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting by either notifying our Assistant Secretary\nor returning a later-dated proxy. The address of our Assistant Secretary is 1010 Wayne Avenue, 14th Floor, Silver Spring,\nMaryland 20910, Attention: Karen Wishart. If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other record holder\n(i.e., in “street name”), you must either direct the record holder of your shares how to vote your shares or obtain a proxy\nfrom the record holder to vote at the meeting.\nQ:What does it mean if I obtain more than one proxy card?\nIf you receive more than one proxy card it means you hold shares registered in more than one account. Sign and\nreturn all proxy cards to ensure that all of your shares are voted.\nQ:What are the voting rights of the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock?\nOn each matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one\nvote and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Members of our Board of Directors are elected by a\nplurality of votes cast. This means that the nominees that receive the most votes cast will be elected to the board, even if\nthey do not receive a majority of votes cast. At the close of business on August 12, 2024, there were 8,655,770 outstanding\nshares of our Class A common stock and 2,861,843 outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. Accordingly, a total\nof 37,274,200 votes may be cast at the meeting. Class C and Class D common stock are not entitled to vote on any proposal\npresented at the meeting.\nQ:What constitutes a quorum?\nA quorum exists when the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Urban One voting common stock\nhave been voted prior to the meeting or are present at the meeting by proxy. A quorum is necessary to take action at the\nmeeting. Abstentions, instructions to withhold voting authority and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of\ndetermining whether there is a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee, who holds shares for a beneficial\nowner, does not vote on a proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received\nvoting instructions from the beneficial owner. In the event that a quorum is not obtained at the meeting, we expect that the\nmeeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies.\nIf a quorum is not present, the stockholders present by proxy may adjourn the meeting to another time or place.\nUnless the adjournment is for more than 30 days or a new record date is set for the adjourned meeting, no further notice of\nthe adjourned meeting need be given. At the adjourned meeting, we may transact any business which might have been\ntransacted at the original meeting.\nQ:How many votes are needed for approval of each proposal?\nIf a quorum is present at the meeting:\n• the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by all eligible holders of Class A common stock will be\nnecessary for the election of Terry L. Jones and Brian W. McNeill as Class A directors;\n• the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by all eligible holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock will be necessary for the election of the remaining director nominees;\n• the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by all eligible holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock will be necessary for the advisory vote on executive compensation for named executive officers;\n• the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by all eligible holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock will be necessary to determine the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation for\nnamed executive officers;\n• the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all eligible holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock will be necessary for amendment and restatement of the Urban One 2019 Equity and Performance\nIncentive Plan to (i) correct a typographical error with respect to the duration of options and (ii) increase the\nnumber of Class A and Class D shares available for issuance; and\n• the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all eligible holders of Class A common stock and Class B\ncommon stock will be necessary for the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public\naccounting firm.\nQ:How do our officers and directors intend to vote?\nWe have been advised by various members of management and the Board of Directors who, in the aggregate, hold\nor otherwise have voting power with respect to 893,890 shares of Class A common stock and 2,861,843 shares of Class B\ncommon stock (together representing approximately 79.2% of the votes possible) that they intend to vote such shares in\nfavor of each of the proposals to be presented for consideration and approval at the meeting. Further, we are a “controlled\ncompany” under rules governing the listing of our securities on the NASDAQ Stock Market because more than 50% of our\nvoting power is held by Catherine L. Hughes, our Chairperson of the board and Secretary, and Alfred C. Liggins, III, our\nCEO and President. Ms. Hughes and Mr. Liggins together hold shares of stock representing approximately 79.1% of the\nvotes possible.\nQ:What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?\nShareholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you:\n• Indicate when voting on the internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board\nof Directors; or\n• Sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions,\nthen the persons named as proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board of\nDirectors on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with\nrespect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the annual meeting.\nBeneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in “street name”\nand do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions then, under applicable rules, the\norganization that holds your shares may generally vote on “routine” matters but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters. If\nthe organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine\nmatter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with\nrespect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.”\nQ:Which ballot measures are considered “routine” or “non-routine”?\nThe ratification of the appointment of Ernst and Young, LLP, as the Company’s independent registered public\naccounting firm (Proposal No. 6) is considered a matter considered routine under applicable rules. A broker or other\nnominee may generally vote on routine matters, and, therefore, no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection\nwith Proposal No. 6.\nQ:Who can attend the Annual Meeting?\nAll stockholders as of August 12, 2024 can attend telephonically.\nQ:Who will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation?\nWe will pay all expenses incurred in connection with this proxy solicitation.

The final voting results will be tallied by\nthe inspector of election and published in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company is required to\nfile with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.\nQ:Will all subsequent annual meetings be held telephonically, virtually or otherwise without a physical\nmeeting?\nUrban One has not made a determination to hold all future stockholder meetings telephonically, virtually or\nwithout physical location. While Urban One has made no determinations with respect to future meetings, Urban One\nreserves the right to hold telephonic or virtual meetings in accordance with applicable law and as other circumstances may\ndictate.\nPROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF CLASS A DIRECTORS\n(CLASS A COMMON STOCK ONLY)\nTwo Class A directors will be elected at the 2024 annual meeting to serve until the 2025 annual meeting.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Board of Directors was comprised of six members, four of\nwhom were neither officers, nor employees of Urban One. The Board held five meetings during the calendar year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, and acted four times by unanimous written consent. All six members of the Board of Directors,\nincluding each of the current six directors who are currently standing for election, attended more than 75% of the aggregate\nnumber of meetings of the board and committees thereof on which he or she served. It is the policy of the Company that all\nmembers of the Board of Directors attend annual meetings of the stockholders. All of the directors attended the 2023\nannual meeting of the stockholders of the Company.\nControlled Company Exemption\nWe are a “controlled company” within the meaning of Rule 5615(c)(1) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules, because\nmore than 50% of our voting power is held by Catherine L. Hughes, our Chairperson of the Board and Secretary, and\nAlfred C. Liggins, III, our CEO and President. See “Security Ownership of Beneficial Owners and Management” below.\nTherefore, we are not subject to NASDAQ Stock Market listing rules that would otherwise require us to have: (i) a\nmajority of independent directors on the board; (ii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors;\n(iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers\ndetermined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent\ndirectors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the board’s selection, either by a majority of the\nindependent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors.\nBoard Leadership Structure\nMs. Hughes has been Chairperson of the Board of Directors since 1980. Since the appointment of Mr. Liggins as\nCEO in 1997, the roles of Chairperson of the Board and CEO have been separated. We believe it is the CEO’s\nresponsibility to run the Company and the Chairperson’s responsibility to run the Board of Directors. By having Ms.\nHughes serve as Chairperson of the Board, Mr. Liggins is better able to focus on running the day-to-day operations of the\nCompany. Bifurcating the roles enables non-management Directors to raise issues and concerns for Board consideration\nwithout immediately involving the CEO. The Chairperson or lead Director also serves as a liaison between the Board and\nsenior management and also provides further vision as to the strategic direction of the Company. Finally, the Board has a\nthird leadership position in the Chairpersons of our Audit Committee. As discussed below, our Audit Committee is\ncomprised of three independent directors. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of\nthe accounting, auditing, and reporting practices of Urban One and for the Company’s risk management. The Chair of the\nAudit Committee effectively serves as a “check” on both the Chairperson and the CEO by representing a strong outside\npresence with significant financial and business experience.\nThe Board of Directors believes that the appropriate leadership structure should be based on the needs and\ncircumstances of the Board, the Company, and its stockholders at a given point in time, and that the Board should remain\nadaptable to shaping the leadership structure as those needs change in the future.\nCommunication with the Board\nOur stockholders may communicate directly with the Board of Directors. All communications should be in written\nform and directed to Urban One’s Assistant Secretary at the following address:\nAssistant Secretary\nUrban One, Inc.\n1010 Wayne Avenue, 14th Floor\nSilver Spring, Maryland 20910\nCommunications should be enclosed in a sealed envelope that prominently indicates that it is intended for Urban\nOne’s Board of Directors. Each communication intended for Urban One’s Board of Directors and received by the Assistant\nSecretary that is related to the operation of Urban One and is relevant to the director’s service on the board shall be\nforwarded to the specified party following its clearance through normal review and appropriate security procedures.\nCommittees of the Board of Directors\nThe board has a standing audit committee, compensation committee and nominating committee.\nAudit Committee\nThe audit committee consists of D. Geoffrey Armstrong, Brian W. McNeill, Terry L. Jones, and Doyle Mitchell,\neach of whom satisfies the requirements for audit committee membership under the listing standards of the NASDAQ\nStock Market. Each of the audit committee members is an “independent director”, as that term is defined in Rule\n5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.

The board has adopted a written audit committee charter, which is available\non our website at https://urban1.com/urban-one-investor-relations/. The audit committee met five times during the calendar\nyear ended December 31, 2023.\nThe audit committee is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and\nreporting practices of Urban One, and as part of this responsibility the audit committee:\n• selects our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, including non-audit\nservices, if any;\n• reviews the scope and results of the annual audit;\n• reviews the adequacy of the system of internal accounting controls and internal control over financial reporting;\n• reviews and discusses the financial statements and accounting policies with management and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm;\n• reviews the performance and fees of our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm;\n• reviews the audit committee charter; and\n• reviews related party transactions, if any.\nThe audit committee also oversees Urban One’s risk policies and processes relating to the financial statements and\nfinancial reporting processes, as well as key credit liquidity risks, market risks and compliance, and the guidelines, policies\nand processes for monitoring and mitigating those risks.\nCompensation Committee\nOur compensation committee consists of Terry L.

The board has adopted a revised written compensation committee charter.

The nominating committee does not have a charter.\nThe nominating committee reviews the qualifications of all persons recommended by stockholders as nominees to\nthe Board of Directors to determine whether the recommended nominees will make good candidates for consideration for\nmembership on the board. The nominating committee has not established specific minimum qualifications for\nrecommended nominees. However, as a matter of practice, the nominating committee evaluates recommended nominees\nfor directors based on their integrity, judgment, independence, financial and business acumen, relevant experience, and\ntheir ability to act on behalf of all stockholders, as well as meet the needs of the Board of Directors, including the need to\nhave a diversity of perspective. In the consideration of diversity of perspective, the nominating committee is most\nconcerned with finding nominees that counter any perceived weaknesses in board composition. Such weaknesses may\ninclude weaknesses in perspective based upon race, sex, gender identification, skill sets and industry insight particularly as\nthe Company diversifies its business. Following such evaluation, the nominating committee will make recommendations\nfor director membership and review the recommendations with the Board of Directors, which will decide whether to invite\nthe candidate to be a nominee for election to the board. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race,\nreligion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, disability or any other basis proscribed by law. The nominating committee\nrecommended to the board that the incumbent directors be nominated for re-election to the board at the 2024 annual\nmeeting.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and meets the\nrequirements of the rules of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market.

To achieve this, we aim to provide a performance-based compensation package that\nis competitive in the markets and industries in which we compete for talent, provides rewards for achieving financial,\noperational, and strategic performance goals, and aligns executives’ financial interests with those of our shareholders.\nWe operate in the intensely competitive media industry, which is characterized by rapidly changing technology,\nevolving industry standards, frequent introduction of new media services, price and cost competition, limited advertising\ndollars, and extensive regulation. We face many aggressive and well-financed competitors. In this environment, our\nsuccess depends on attracting and maintaining a leadership team with the integrity, skills, and dedication needed to manage\na dynamic organization and the vision to anticipate and respond to future market developments. We use our executive\ncompensation program to help us achieve this objective. Part of the compensation package is designed to enable us to\nassemble and retain a group of executives who have the collective and individual abilities necessary to run our business to\nmeet these challenges. Other parts are intended to focus these executives on achieving financial results that enhance the\nvalue of our stockholders’ investment. At the same time, the compensation structure is flexible, so that we can meet the\nchanging needs of our business over time and reward executive officers and managers based on the financial performance\nof operations under their control.\nProcess\nOur compensation committee meets periodically throughout the year. In addition, members of the compensation\ncommittee discuss compensation matters with our CEO and CFO and among themselves informally outside of meetings. In\nestablishing the compensation levels for the Company’s executive officers, the compensation committee considers a\nnumber of qualitative and quantitative factors, including the competitive market for executives, the level and types of\ncompensation paid to executive officers in similar positions by comparable companies, and an evaluation of the Company’s\nfinancial and operational performance. We review the compensation paid to executives at other comparable media\ncompanies as a reference point for determining the competitiveness of our executive compensation. Our peer group of radio\nbroadcasting companies includes Cox Radio, Inc., Audacy Communications Corp., and Saga Communications Inc. In\naddition, given the diversity of our business, the compensation committee may review the compensation practices at\ncompanies with which it competes for talent, including television, cable, film, online, software and other publicly held\nbusinesses with a scope and complexity like ours. The compensation committee does not attempt to set each compensation\nelement for any executive within a particular range related to levels provided by peers. Instead, the compensation\ncommittee uses market comparison as one factor in making compensation decisions. Other factors considered when making\nindividual executive compensation decisions include individual contribution and performance, reporting structure, internal\npay relationship, complexity and importance of roles and responsibilities, leadership, and growth potential.\nOur CEO provides input into the compensation discussion and makes recommendations to the compensation\ncommittee for annual compensation changes and bonuses for the executive officers and the appropriateness of additional\nlong-term incentive compensation. The compensation committee has retained and actively consults with a benefits\nconsulting firm to assist with setting compensation for our executives.\nPrincipal Components of Executive Compensation\nWe seek to achieve our compensation philosophy through three key compensation elements:\n• base salary;\n• a performance-based annual bonus (that constitutes the short-term incentive element of our program), which may\nbe paid in cash, restricted stock units, shares of stock or a combination of these; and\n• grants of long-term, equity-based compensation (that constitute the long-term incentive element of our program),\nsuch as stock options and/or restricted stock units, which may be subject to time-based and/or performance-based\nvesting requirements.\nThe compensation committee believes that this three-part approach is consistent with programs adopted by\nsimilarly situated companies and best serves the interests of our stockholders. The approach enables us to meet the\nrequirements of the competitive environment in which we operate, while ensuring that executive officers are compensated\nin a manner that advances both the short and long-term interests of our stockholders. Under this approach, compensation\nfor our executive officers involves a high proportion of pay that is “at risk,” namely, the annual bonus and the value of\nstock options and restricted stock units. Stock options and/or restricted stock units relate a sizable portion of each\nexecutive’s long-term remuneration directly to the stock price appreciation realized by our stockholders.\nThe compensation committee may award stock options or grant restricted stock to any executive officer or other\neligible participants under the Plan, on its own initiative or at the recommendation of management. In accordance with our\nStock Plan Administration Procedures, as approved by the compensation committee, the grant date for grants approved by\nthe compensation committee to executive officers (other than a companywide grants) is the next monthly grant date\nimmediately following the meeting of the compensation committee. Monthly grant dates are the fifth day of each month, or\nthe next NASDAQ trading day in the event the fifth day is not a business day. However, it is also our practice in granting\noptions to executive officers to wait for the release of any material non-public information and settlement of that\ninformation in the marketplace.\nEmployment Agreements\nEmployment Agreement of the President and CEO\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer.

The first annual grant priced and vested on September 27, 2022, and the second and third annual grants priced\nand vested in January 2023 and January 2024, respectively.\nUnder her prior employment agreement under which the Company and Ms. Hughes currently operate, Ms. Hughes\nis also entitled to receive a pro-rata portion of her bonus upon termination due to death or disability. Ms. Hughes also\nreceives standard retirement, welfare, and fringe benefits, as well as vehicle and wireless communication allowances and\nfinancial manager services.\nPost-Termination and Change in Control Benefits\nUnder the terms of her employment agreement, upon termination without cause or for good reason within two\nyears following a change of control, Ms. Hughes will receive an amount equal to three times the sum of (i) her annual base\nsalary and (ii) the average of her last three annual incentive bonus payments, in a cash lump sum within five days of such\ntermination, a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, and continued welfare benefits for three years, subject to\nall applicable federal, state and local deductions. Similarly, under the terms of his employment agreement, upon\ntermination without cause or for good reason within two years following a change of control, Mr. Liggins will receive an\namount equal to three times the sum of (i) his annual base salary and (ii) the average of his last three annual incentive\nbonus payments, in a cash lump sum within five days of such termination, a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of\ntermination, and continued welfare benefits for three years, subject to all applicable federal, state and local deductions.\nUnder Ms. Hughes’ and Mr. Liggins’ employment agreements the terms “cause” and “good reason” are defined as\nfollows:\n“Cause” means (i) the commission by the executive of a felony, fraud, embezzlement or an act of serious,\ncriminal moral turpitude which, in case of any of the foregoing, in the good faith judgment of the board, is likely to cause\nmaterial harm to the business of the Company and the Company affiliates, taken as a whole, provided, that in the absence\nof a conviction or plea of nolo contendere, the Company will have the burden of proving the commission of such act by\nclear and convincing evidence; (ii) the commission of an act by the executive constituting material financial dishonesty\nagainst the Company or any Company affiliate, provided, that in the absence of a conviction or plea of nolo contendere, the\nCompany will have the burden of proving the commission of such act by a preponderance of the evidence; (iii) the repeated\nrefusal by the executive to use his reasonable and diligent efforts to follow the lawful and reasonable directives of the\nboard; or (iv) the executive’s willful gross neglect in carrying out his material duties and responsibilities under the\nagreement, provided, that unless the board reasonably determines that a breach described in clause (iii) or (iv) is not\ncurable, the executive will be given written notice of such breach and will be given an opportunity to cure such breach to\nthe reasonable satisfaction of the board within thirty (30) days of receipt of such written notice.\n“Good Reason” shall be deemed to exist if, without the express written consent of the executive, (i) the\nexecutive’s rate of annual base salary is reduced, (ii) the executive suffers a substantial reduction in his title, duties or\nresponsibilities, (iii) the Company fails to pay the executive’s annual base salary when due or to pay any other material\namount due to the executive hereunder within five (5) days of written notice from the executive, (iv) the Company\nmaterially breaches the agreement and fails to correct such breach within thirty (30) days after receiving the executive’s\ndemand that it remedy the breach, or (v) the Company fails to obtain a satisfactory written agreement from any successor to\nassume and agree to perform the agreement, which successor the executive reasonably concludes is capable of performing\nthe Company’s financial obligations under this Agreement.\nThe foregoing summaries of the definitions of “cause” and “good reason” are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the actual terms of the employment agreements for Ms. Hughes’ and Mr. Liggins’ filed with those certain\nCurrent Reports Form 8-K filed April 18, 2008, and April 9, 2024, respectively.\nUnder the terms of his employment agreement, in the event that Mr. Thompson is terminated other than for cause,\nprovided Mr. Thompson executes a general liability release, the Company will pay Mr. Thompson severance in an amount\nequal to six month’s base compensation, subject to all applicable federal, state, and local deductions. With regard to Mr.\nThompson, the foregoing summary of the definitions of “cause” and “good reason” are qualified in their entirety by\nreference to the actual terms of his employment agreement filed with that certain Current Report on Form 8-K filed\nOctober 3, 2022.\nOther Benefits and Perquisites\nAs part of our competitive compensation package to attract and retain talented employees, we offer retirement,\nhealth, and other benefits to our employees. Our named executive officers participate in the same benefit plans as our other\nsalaried employees. The only benefit programs offered to our named executive officers either exclusively or with terms\ndifferent from those offered to other eligible employees are the following:\nDeferred Compensation. We had a deferred compensation plan that allowed Catherine L. Hughes, our\nChairperson, to defer compensation on a voluntary, non-tax qualified basis. The plan was terminated in 2017, and as such\nMs. Hughes did not defer any of her compensation during the year ended December 31, 2023. The amount owed to her as\ndeferred compensation for prior years is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation of our Company. Deferred amounts\naccrue interest based upon the return earned on an investment account with a designated brokerage firm established by\nUrban One. All deferred amounts are payable in a lump sum 30 days after the date of the event causing the distribution to\nbe paid. No named executive officer earns above-market or preferential earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation.\nOther Perquisites. We provide few perquisites to our named executive officers. Currently, we provide or\nreimburse executives for a company automobile, driver and various administrative services including a financial manager\nand a personal assistant.\nWe have set forth the incremental cost of providing these benefits and perquisites to our named executives in the\n2023 Summary Compensation Table in the “All Other Compensation” column.\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a defined contribution 401(k) savings and retirement plan. In the calendar year 2023,\nparticipants could contribute up to $22,500 of their gross compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employees ages 50\nor older could make an additional catch-up contribution of in calendar year 2023 up to $7,500 of their gross compensation.\nIn the calendar year 2022, participants could contribute up to $20,500 of their gross compensation, subject to certain\nlimitations. Employees ages 50 or older could make an additional catch-up contribution of in calendar year 2022 up to\n$6,500 of their gross compensation.\nIn the calendar year 2024, participants can contribute up to $23,000 of their gross compensation, subject to certain\nlimitations. Employees ages 50 or older can make an additional catch-up contribution of in calendar year 2023 up to $7,500\nof their gross compensation. The Company currently does not offer any matching component with respect to its 401(k)\nsavings and retirement plan.\nTax Deductibility of Executive Compensation\nSection 162(m) of the Code imposes limitations upon the federal income tax deductibility of certain compensation\npaid to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and to each of our other highly compensated executive\nofficers. Under these limitations, we may deduct such compensation only to the extent that during any year the\ncompensation paid to any such officer does not exceed $1,000,000 or meets certain limited conditions. The compensation\ncommittee believes that it is in our best interests to retain flexibility and discretion to make compensation awards to foster\nachievement of goals the Committee deems important to our success, including for example encouraging employee\nretention, rewarding achievement of non- quantifiable goals, and achieving progress with specific projects.\nOur compensation committee may also take accounting considerations, including the impact of Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 718, into account in structuring compensation programs and determining the form\nand amount of compensation awarded.\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe following table sets forth the total compensation for each of our named executive officers, for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022:\nNon-qualified\nNon-Equity Deferred\nName and Stock Awards Option Incentive Plan Compensation All Other\nPrincipal Position Year Salary $ Bonus (1) $ (2) $ Awards (2) $ Compensation $ Earnings $ Compensation $ Total $\nCatherine L.

These values are based on assumptions described in Note 9 to the Company's audited\nconsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\n(3) For 2023 and 2022, for company automobile provided to Ms. Hughes and financial services and administrative support in the amounts of $7,015 and $4,988 and\n$32,985 and $43,816, respectively.\n(4) Mr. Liggins’ employment terms provide, among other things, that in recognition of Mr. Liggins’ contributions in founding TV One on our behalf, he is eligible to\nreceive an award amount equal to approximately 4% of any proceeds from distributions or other liquidity events in excess of the return of the Company's aggregate\ninvestment in TV One. The Company's obligation to pay the award to Mr. Liggins was triggered during 2016 after its recovery of the aggregate amount of our pre-\nComcast Buyout capital contribution in TV One, and only upon actual receipt of distributions of cash or marketable securities. An award in the amount of\n$2,939,512 and $4,038,131 was paid in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, for 2023 and 2022, the Company provided financial services and administrative\nsupport to Mr. Liggins in the amounts of $150,000 and $166,724, respectively.\nPay Versus Performance\nAs required by new pay versus performance (“PVP”) rules adopted by the SEC in August 2022 and in effect for the first time for this proxy statement, the\nfollowing Pay Versus Performance table (“PVP Table”) provides required information about compensation for our named executive officers for the periods ended\nDecember 31, 2022, and 2023 (each of 2022 and 2023, a “Covered Year”). We refer to all the named executive officers covered in the PVP Table below, collectively, as\nthe “PVP NEOs.” The PVP Table also provides information about the results for certain measures of financial performance during those same Covered Years. In\nreviewing this information, we believe you should consider:\n• The information in columns (b) and (d) of the PVP Table comes directly from this year’s Summary Compensation Table (or last year’s Summary\nCompensation Table), without adjustment, calculated in the manner as required under SEC rules for such table;\n• As required by the SEC’s PVP rules, we describe the information in columns (c) and (e) of the PVP Table as “compensation actually paid” (or “CAP”) to the\napplicable PVP NEOs. However, we believe these CAP amounts do not entirely reflect the final compensation that our NEOs actually earned for their service\nin the Covered Years, respectively. Instead, in accordance with the SEC’s PVP rules the amounts represent a combination of realized pay (primarily for cash\namounts and equity that vested in the applicable Covered Year) and realizable or accrued pay as of the last day of the applicable Covered Year (primarily for\nequity awards that are unvested or vested but unexercised). As a result, we urge investors to use caution when evaluating CAP amounts, as they are calculated\nin a manner different than any information that we may have presented before; and\n• As required by the SEC’s PVP rules, we provide information in the PVP Table below about our absolute total shareholder return (“TSR”) results and our U.S.\nGAAP net income results (the “External Measures”) during the Covered Years. In column (h) we also present information with respect to our Adjusted\nEBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. We present this measure as management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides useful\ninformation to management and investors by excluding certain income/(loss), expenses, gains, and losses that may not be indicative of the Company’s core\noperating and financial results. Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because certain items included in the calculation of net income/(loss) may\neither mask or exaggerate trends in the Company's ongoing operating performance measures, by identifying the individual adjustments, provide a useful\nmechanism for investors to consider these adjusted measures with some or all the identified adjustments. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the\ncomparable GAAP financial measure is included in Non-GAAP Financial Measures in ITEM 7.

Liggins, III, who is our PEO. Our non-PEO PVP NEOs (“Non-PEO NEOs”) were\nCatherine L. Hughes, our Chairperson, and Peter D. Thompson, our Chief Financial Officer, for each of the Covered Years.

Each of these yearly percentage\nchanges was then applied to a deemed fixed investment of $100 at the beginning of each Measurement Period to produce the Covered Year-end values of such\ninvestment as of the end of 2023 and 2022, as applicable. Because Covered Years are presented in the table in reverse chronical order (from top to bottom), the\ntable should be read from bottom to top for purposes of understanding cumulative returns over time.\nThe following charts provide, across the Covered Years, descriptions of the relationships between (1) the CAP for the PEO and the average CAP for our Non-\nPEO NEOs (in each case as set forth in the PVP Table above) and (2) each of the performance measures set forth in columns (f) and (g) of the PVP Table above.\n\nThe following table sets forth the number of shares of common stock subject to exercisable and unexercisable stock options held as of December 31, 2022.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at 2023 Fiscal Year-End\nOPTION AWARDS STOCK AWARDS STOCK AWARDS\nNumber of Securities Number of Securities Number of Shares of Market Value of Number of Shares of Market Value of\nUnderlying Unexercised Underlying Unexercised Stock That Have Shares of Stock That Stock That Have Shares of Stock That\nOptions Options Not Vested Have Not Vested Not Vested Have Not Vested\nName (#) exercisable (#) unexercisable (#) ($) (#) ($)\nOption\nExercise Option Date Date\nClass A Granted Vested Class D Granted Vested Class D Granted Vested Price ($) Expiration Date Class D Granted Award Vests Class D Class A Granted Award Vests Class A\nC Ha ut gh he eri sne L. 97,668 10/06/2014 04/06/2015 2.75 10/06/2024 — — — —\n97,666 10/06/2014 12/31/2015 2.75 10/06/2024\n97,666 10/06/2014 12/31/2016 2.75 10/06/2024\n199,836 08/07/2017 01/05/2018 1.90 08/07/2027 — — — —\n210,937 01/05/2018 01/05/2019 1.80 01/05/2028 — — — —\n174,971 07/05/2019 01/06/2020 2.17 07/05/2029 — — — —\n189,843 06/05/2020 01/06/2021 2.00 06/05/2030 — — — —\n101,702 09/27/2022 09/27/2022 93,750 09/27/2022 09/27/2022 4.23 09/27/2032 — — 281,250 09/27/2022 01/05/2025 $ 1,279,688\n101,272 02/06/2023 02/06/2023 5.15 02/06/2023 — — — —\nA Lil gfr ge id n sC , .

The audit\ncommittee charter is posted on Urban One’s website located at https://urban1.com/urban-one-investor-relations/. The audit\ncommittee fulfills its responsibilities through periodic meetings with our independent registered public accounting firm and\nmanagement. The audit committee reviews the financial information that will be provided to stockholders and others, the\nsystems of internal controls that management and the board have established, and the audit process. In fulfilling these\nresponsibilities, the committee, among other things, oversees the independent registered public accounting firm and\nconfirms their independence, reviews the adequacy of the system of internal accounting controls and internal control over\nfinancial reporting, reviews financial statements, earnings releases and accounting matters, and reviews related party\ntransactions. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of\ninternal controls. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the\nconformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nThe committee meetings regularly included separate sessions with the independent registered public accounting\nfirm, in each case without the presence of Urban One’s management. As part of its oversight of Urban One’s financial\nstatements, the committee reviewed and discussed with both management and the independent registered public accounting\nfirm the audited financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023,\nand quarterly operating results prior to their issuance.\nThe committee also typically holds discussions with management and the independent registered public\naccounting firm regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with\nthe requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As required due to the Company’s status as an\naccelerated filer for the year ended December 31, 2023, such discussion was held in connection with the filing of the Form\n10-K for 2023. The committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required\nto be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB\"”) Auditing Standard AS 1301,\n“Communications with Audit Committees,” as amended, which includes, among other items, matters related to the conduct\nof the annual audit of Urban One’s financial statements. In addition, the committee discussed with the independent\nregistered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Urban One and its management, including the matters in\nthe written disclosures required by AS 1005, “Independence,” and the committee satisfied itself as to the independent\nregistered public accounting firm’s independence.\nUrban One management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of\nour management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) published by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Internal control over financial reporting\ncannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in\njudgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented\nby collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent\nlimitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process\nsafeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nDuring 2023, management advised the committee that each set of financial statements reviewed had been prepared\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reviewed significant accounting and disclosure issues with\nthe committee. Management also advised the committee of certain control deficiencies in the design and implementation of\nour internal control over financial reporting that constituted material weaknesses. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a\ncombination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is reasonable possibility that a\nmaterial misstatement of our consolidated annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a\ntimely basis. Specifically, we did not design and or implement an effective control environment or control activities as\nfurther detailed below:\n• Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Information and Communication, and Monitoring – We did not have\nappropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the (1) control environment, (2) risk assessment procedures,\n(3) identification of control activities and (4) monitoring activities to prevent or detect material misstatements to\nthe financial statements and assess whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. We\ndid not adequately communicate the relevant information, including objectives and responsibilities, necessary to\nsupport the functioning of internal controls over financial reporting. We did not develop and perform sufficient\nongoing evaluations to ascertain whether the components of internal control were present and functioning. These\ndeficiencies were attributed to an insufficient number of qualified resources with the requisite knowledge to\neffectively perform control design and execution activities and oversee internal control over financial reporting,\nand with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience that is commensurate with the Company’s\nfinancial reporting requirements.\n• IT General Control Activities – The Company has not sufficiently designed and maintained information\ntechnology general controls in the areas of user access, program change management and IT Operations for\ncertain information technology systems that support the Company’s financial reporting and other processes.\nSpecifically, the Company did not maintain (1) user access controls that adequately restrict privileged and end-\nuser access to certain financial applications, system infrastructure, programs, and data to appropriate company\npersonnel, including consideration of segregation of incompatible duties; (2) change management controls for\ncertain financial applications and related system infrastructure to provide reasonable assurance that IT program\nand data changes are authorized, sufficiently tested, approved, and implemented appropriately; and (3) IT\noperations controls for certain financial applications to monitor that scheduled financial programs have run and\nwere completed without errors.\n• Control Activities and Information and Communication - Management has determined that the Company did not\nhave adequate selection and development of effective control activities resulting in the following material\nweaknesses:\n◦ Management did not have properly designed internal controls over its financial statement close process.\nThis includes an inadequate level of precision in management’s review during the financial statement\nclose process, an inadequate evaluation and review of the accounting for significant and non-recurring\ntransactions, ineffective design and operating effectiveness of controls to support proper segregation of\nduties related to the review of manual journal entries and an inadequate review as part of its reporting and\ndisclosure process.\n◦ Management did not have properly designed management review controls over matters that require\nsignificant judgment. Specifically, controls are not designed to sufficiently evaluate the completeness and\naccuracy of data used in account analyses related to judgmental areas. Additionally, the Company’s\nmanagement review controls are not operating effectively, as sufficient evidence was not maintained to\ndemonstrate that reviews occurred with a sufficient level of precision to detect a material misstatement.\n◦ Management did not have appropriately designed internal controls related to the approval of IT\nequipment purchases and the related recognition of this equipment as a fixed asset. Specifically, the\nCompany did not have effective internal controls in place to ensure IT equipment was being purchased\nfor a valid business purpose. Additionally, the Company did not have properly designed internal controls\nto support the existence of its IT assets.\nConsidering the material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, we performed\nadditional procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K were prepared in\naccordance with GAAP. Following such additional procedures, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has\nconcluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows for the periods presented in this Annual Report, in conformity with GAAP.\nPlans for Remediation\nManagement is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, as well as the\ncontinued improvement of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management has implemented and\ncontinues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses are\nremediated.\nIn response to the material weaknesses identified, management designed a remediation plan which was approved\nby the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. As of June 7,2024, management has made progress to remediate the\ncontrol deficiencies contributing to the material weaknesses, as described below:\n• We provided training to new and existing personnel on proper execution of designed control procedures;\n• As part of our ongoing effort to expand our accounting department, we hired a Corporate Controller and a Senior\nVP – Finance/Chief Accounting Officer and engaged external resources to augment our accounting team. We\ndeveloped a preliminary hiring plan which has been approved by the Audit Committee and continued to assess our\npersonnel needs, expertise and requirements and will hire personnel as needed.\n• We engaged external resources with the appropriate depth of expertise to establish a robust financial controls\ngovernance structure, conduct a financial risk assessment, establish internal materiality thresholds, and identify\nkey business processes.\n• We conducted process and control walkthroughs of all key processes to identify risk points and established\ncorresponding controls to address identified design gaps.\n• We have initiated the process to document, implement and redesign controls, policies, and procedures with an\nappropriate level of precision to detect a material misstatement, and to retain sufficient documentation to support\nthe operating effectiveness of the controls. The control enhancement procedures are focused on:\n◦ Increasing the precision and specificity of our control activities, addressing completeness and accuracy of\nthe information used in performing management review controls, as well as documenting sufficient\nevidence of management’s review supporting its conclusions; and\n◦ Modifying our journal entry operating procedures to establish a formal hierarchy of review of journal\nentries to enforce proper segregation of duties in advance of implementing a new general ledger system.\n◦ Assessing roles and permissions across relevant financial systems and restricting access based on job\nresponsibilities.\n◦ Redesigning information technology general controls across relevant systems related to user access and\nchange management.\n• We will also seek to improve the process of assessing the effectiveness of the control environment by;\n◦ Implementing a Governance Risk and Compliance (“GRC”) tool to manage the control assessment\nannually; and\n◦ Designing and implementing an ongoing controls evaluation strategy to be executed by an independent\nparty\nManagement is committed to the remediation of the material weaknesses described above, as well as the\ncontinued improvement of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The actions that we are taking are\nsubject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight of the audit committee of our board of directors. We\nmay also conclude that additional measures may be required to remediate the material weaknesses. We will not be able to\nconclude that we have remediated a material weakness until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time\nand management has concluded, through formal testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We will continue to\nmonitor the design and effectiveness of these and other processes, procedures and controls and make any further changes\nmanagement deems appropriate.\nExcept for the material weaknesses described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial\nreporting during the year ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially\naffect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the committee recommended to the board, and the\nboard approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements in Urban One’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year\nended December 31, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\nRespectfully submitted,\nAudit Committee:\nD. Geoffrey Armstrong, Chairman\nBrian W. McNeill,\nTerry L. Jones\nB. Doyle Mitchell, Jr.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS\nWe review all transactions and relationships in which Urban One and our directors and executive officers or their\nimmediate family members are participants to determine whether such persons have a direct or indirect material interest. In\naddition, our code of ethics requires our directors, executive officers, and principal financial officers to report to the board\nor the audit committee any situation that could be perceived as a conflict of interest. Once a related person transaction has\nbeen identified, the Board of Directors may appoint a special committee of the Board of Directors to review and, if\nappropriate, approve such transaction. The special committee will consider the material facts, such as the nature of the\nrelated person’s interest in the transaction, the terms of the transaction, the importance of the transaction to the related\nperson and to us, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third\nparty under the same or similar circumstances, and other matters it deems appropriate. As required under the SEC rules, we\ndisclose related party transactions that are directly or indirectly material to us or a related person.\nReach Media operates the Tom Joyner Foundation’s Fantastic Voyage® (the “Fantastic Voyage®”), a fund-raising\nevent, on behalf of the Tom Joyner Foundation, Inc. (the “Foundation”), a 501(c)(3) entity. The agreement under which the\nFantastic Voyage® operates provides that Reach Media provide all necessary operations of the cruise and that Reach Media\nwill be reimbursed its expenditures and receive a fee plus a performance bonus. Distributions from operating revenues are\nin the following order until the funds are depleted: up to $250,000 to the Foundation, reimbursement of Reach’s\nexpenditures, up to a $1.0 million fee to Reach Media, a performance bonus of up to 50% of remaining operating revenues\nto Reach Media, with the balance remaining to the Foundation. For 2024 and 2023, $250,000 to the Foundation is\nguaranteed. Reach Media’s earnings for the Fantastic Voyage® in any given year may not exceed $1.75 million. The\nFoundation’s remittances to Reach Media under the agreements are limited to its Fantastic Voyage® related cash\ncollections. Reach Media bears the risk should the Fantastic Voyage® sustain a loss and bears all credit risk associated with\nthe related passenger cruise package sales. The agreement between Reach Media and the Foundation automatically renews\nannually unless termination is mutually agreed or unless a party’s financial requirements are not met, in which case the\nparty not in breach of their obligations has the right, but not the obligation, to terminate unilaterally. As of December 31,\n2023, and 2022, the Foundation owed Reach Media approximately $1.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively, under the\nagreements for the operation of the cruises.\nThe Fantastic Voyage took place during the second quarter of 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023,\nReach Media's revenues, expenses, and operating income for the Fantastic Voyage were approximately $9.7 million, $8.0\nmillion, and $1.75 million, respectively.\nReach Media provides office facilities (including office space, telecommunications facilities, and office\nequipment) to the Foundation. Such services are provided to the Foundation on a pass-through basis at cost. Additionally,\nfrom time to time, the Foundation reimburses Reach Media for expenditures paid on its behalf at Reach Media-related\nevents. Under these arrangements, the Foundation owed immaterial amounts to Reach Media as of December 31, 2023, and\n2022.\nAlfred C. Liggins, President and Chief Executive Officer of Urban One, Inc., is a compensated member of the\nBoard of Directors of Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”), a performance rights organization to which the Company pays\nlicense fees in the ordinary course of business. During the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company\nincurred expense of approximately $3.2 million and $3.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the\nCompany owed BMI approximately $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively. In February 2024, a shareholder group led\nby New Mountain Capital, LLC completed its acquisition of BMI. Upon completion of the acquisition, Mr. Liggins ceased\nto be a member of the Board of Directors of BMI.\nPROPOSAL 3 — ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COMPENSATION\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requires that the\nCompany’s shareholders have the opportunity to cast a non-binding advisory vote regarding the approval of the\ncompensation disclosed in this proxy statement of the Company's executive officers who are named in the Summary\nCompensation Table (the “Named Executive Officers”.\nThe Company believes that the compensation policies for the Named Executive Officers are designed to attract,\nmotivate and retain talented executive officers and are aligned with the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders.\nThis advisory shareholder vote, commonly referred to as a “Say On Pay” vote, gives shareholders the opportunity to\napprove or not approve the compensation of the Named Executive Officers that is disclosed in this proxy statement by\nvoting for or against the following resolution (or by abstaining with respect to the resolution):\nAccordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n“RESOLVED, that the Company’s stockholders approve the compensation paid to the Company’s named\nexecutive officers, as disclosed in the Company’s Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant\nto Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Summary Compensation Table, the other related compensation tables and\nnarrative discussion.”\nThis advisory resolution is non-binding on the Board. Although non-binding, the Board and the Compensation\nCommittee will carefully review and consider the voting results when evaluating our executive compensation program.\nThe Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” proposal number 3.\nPROPOSAL 4: FREQUENCY OF ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Company's shareholders to have the opportunity to cast a non-binding\nadvisory vote regarding how frequently the Company conducts a non-binding advisory vote (similar to Proposal No. 3\nabove) on the compensation disclosed in the Company's proxy statement of its Named Executive Officers.\nThis advisory shareholder vote, commonly referred to as a \"Say When On Pay” vote gives shareholders the\nopportunity to indicate whether they would prefer that the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's Named\nExecutive Officers occur every one, two or three years. Shareholders may also abstain from voting on the proposal.\nThe option receiving the greatest number of votes (every one, two or three years) will be considered the frequency\napproved by shareholders. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on either the Board of Directors or the\nCompany. The Company's Nominating Committee will, however, consider the outcome of the shareholder vote on this\nproposal when considering its recommendation to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors itself will consider\nwhen determining how often to hold an advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive\ncompensation.\nRequired Vote and Recommendation\nThe Board Unanimously Recommends that You Vote for a Frequency of Once Every “3 YEARS” for Future Non-\nBinding Stockholder Advisory Votes on Compensation Awarded to our Named Executive Officers.\nPROPOSAL 5 — APPROVAL OF SECOND AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE 2019 EQUITY AND\nPERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PLAN\nOn April 10, 2019, the Board of Directors adopted, subject to stockholder approval, an equity and incentive plan\ncalled the Urban One 2019 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (the “2019 Incentive Plan”). The stockholders approved\nthe 2019 Incentive Plan on May 21, 2019. The original 2019 Incentive Plan provided for issuance of up to 5,500,000 shares\nof the Company’s Class D common stock.\nOn April 30, 2021, the members of our Board of Directors constituting our Compensation Committee and all of\nour independent Board members adopted (the “Compensation Committee/Independent Directors”), subject to stockholder\napproval, certain amendments to the 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement”).\nOn June 23, 2021, the Company asked it stockholders to approve the 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and\nRestatement to (i) permit issuance of 2,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock and (ii) provide for issuance of an\nadditional 5,519,575 shares of our Class D common stock. After the stockholders approved the 2021 First Incentive Plan\nAmendment and Restatement there were a total of 2,000,000 Class A shares were added to the 2019 Incentive Plan and\n5,519,575 Class D shares were also added. Immediately after passage of the 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and\nRestatement, giving effect to prior grants but before to any subsequent grant activity there were a total of 2,000,000 Class\nA shares and 6,000,000 Class D shares available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan and a total of 11,109,575 Class\nD shares had been loaded into the 2019 Incentive Plan since its inception.\nAs of August 19, 2024, after giving effect to grants made under the 2019 Incentive Plan as amended by the 2021\nFirst Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement, 1,250,000 Class A shares and no Class D shares remained in reserve\nunder the 2019 Incentive Plan.\nOn August 19, 2024, the Compensation Committee/Independent Directors, subject to stockholder approval,\napproved certain further amendments to the 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2024 Second Incentive Plan Amendment and\nRestatement”). In this proposal, the Company is asking our stockholders to approve the 2024 Second Incentive Plan\nAmendment and Restatement to: (i) correct a typographical error with respect to the duration of options; and (ii) provide\nfor issuance of an additional 750,000 shares of our Class A common stock and 7,000,000 shares of our Class D common\nstock. Upon passage of the 2024 Second Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement there will be a total of 2,000,000\nClass A shares and 7,000,000 Class D shares available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The total number of\nshares authorized for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan, giving effect to its original authorization of 5,500,000 Class\nD Shares, the 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement with its 2,000,000 Class A Shares and 5,519,575\nClass D Shares and the 2024 Second Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement is (i) 750,000 shares of our Class A\ncommon stock and (ii) 18,019,575 shares of our Class D common stock. Immediately after given effect to the 2024 Second\nIncentive Plan Amendment and Restatement 2,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock will be in ungranted and in\nreserve and (ii) 7,000,000 shares of our Class D common stock will be in ungranted and in reserve. A copy of the Urban\nOne, Inc. 2019 Second Amended and Restated Equity and Performance Incentive Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit A and\nthis summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to Exhibit A.\nOur board believes that the 2019 Incentive Plan, as amended and proposed to be amended, is a vital component of\nour employee compensation programs, since it allows us the ability to compensate our employees, consultants and non-\nemployee directors whose contributions are important to our success, by offering them the opportunity to participate in our\nfuture performance, while at the same time providing an incentive to build long-term stockholder value. We operate in a\ncompetitive market and grants are essential in helping us attract talented individuals. Likewise, annual grants are essential\nin helping us retain and motivate our most valuable employees. Both new hire grants and annual grants help keep\nemployees’ interests aligned with the interests of our stockholders.\nThe 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement included a typographical error creating an\ninconsistency in the life of stock options in connection with the Company’s prior practice and policy. The typographical\nerror limited the life of stock options issued under the 2019 Incentive Plan to seven years compared to the Company’s\nhistorical practice and policy of stock options having a life of 10 years. The purpose of this proposed amendment is to\ncorrect the typographical error and provide for a 10-year period for exercise of stock options under the 2019 Incentive Plan\nto bring the 2019 Incentive Plan in line with the Company’s historical practice and policy.\n2019 Incentive Plan Share Reserve\nAs of August 19, 2024, after giving effect to grants made under the 2019 Incentive Plan, including after giving\neffect to the 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement, 1,250,000 Class A shares and no Class D shares\nremained in reserve under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee believes that this share reserve amount is\ninsufficient to meet future long-term incentive needs of the Company. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee believes\nthat the request for an additional 750,000 shares of our Class A common stock and 7,000,000 shares of our Class D\ncommon stock is reasonable and necessary to allow us to replenish our share usage from previous years, to continue\ngranting practices in the future and to respond to competition for future employees. Upon passage of the 2024 Second\nIncentive Plan Amendment and Restatement there will be a total of 2,000,000 Class A shares and 7,000,000 Class D shares\navailable for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan.\nDescription of the 2019 Incentive Plan\nThe following description of the 2019 Incentive Plan, as amended, by the 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment\nand Restatement, is only a summary of certain provisions of the plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full\ntext of the Amended and Restated 2019 Incentive Plan, a copy of which is included as Appendix A to our proxy statement\nfiled April 30, 2021.\nPurpose and Summary of Terms of the 2019 Incentive Plan\nThe purpose of the 2019 Incentive Plan is to promote the long-term financial success of the Company by\nproviding a means to attract, retain and reward individuals who can and do contribute to such success and to further align\ntheir interests with those of the Company’s stockholders.\nAdministration of the 2019 Incentive Plan\nThe 2019 Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee consisting of two or more directors who\nare “non-employee directors.” In the event that for any reason the Compensation Committee is unable to act or if the\nCompensation Committee at the time of any grant, award or other acquisition under the 2019 Incentive Plan does not\nconsist of two or more “non-employee directors,” or if there is no such committee, then the 2019 Incentive Plan will be\nadministered by the Board, except to the extent such Board action would have adverse consequences under Section 16(b)\nof the Securities Exchange Act.\nSubject to the other provisions of the 2019 Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee has authority, in its sole\nand absolute discretion: (i) to grant cash-based awards, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted\nstock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and other stock-based awards, all of which are referred\nto collectively as “Awards”; (ii) to determine the terms and conditions of each Award granted (which need not be\nidentical); (iii) to interpret the 2019 Incentive Plan and all Awards granted thereunder; and (iv) to make all other\ndeterminations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2019 Incentive Plan.\nEligibility. The persons eligible for participation in the 2019 Incentive Plan as recipients of Awards include employees,\nconsultants and non-employee directors to the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company.\nShares Subject to the 2019 Incentive Plan.\nAs originally approved, the total number and class of shares which could be issued pursuant to Awards granted\nunder the 2019 Incentive Plan could not exceed 5,500,000 shares of Class D Common Stock plus any shares subject to\noutstanding awards under any prior plan as of the Effective Date that, on or after the Effective Date, cease for any reason to\nbe subject to such awards (other than by reason of exercise or settlement of the awards to the extent they are exercised for\nor settled in vested and nonforfeitable shares of Class D Common Stock). The 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and\nRestatement provided for (i) the issuance of 2,000,000 Class A shares under the 2019 Incentive Plan (in addition to Class D\nshares) and (ii) increased to the available Class D share reserve back up to 6,000,000 shares.\nAs of August 19, 2024, after giving effect to grants made under the 2019 Incentive Plan, including after giving\neffect to the 2021 First Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement, 1,250,000 Class A shares and zero Class D shares\nremained in reserve under the 2019 Incentive Plan. As noted above, the Compensation Committee believes that this share\nreserve amount is insufficient to meet future long-term incentive needs of the Company. Accordingly, the Compensation\nCommittee believes that the request for an additional 750,000 shares of our Class A common stock and 7,000,000 shares of\nour Class D common stock is reasonable and necessary to allow us to replenish our share usage from previous years, to\ncontinue granting practices in the future and to respond to competition for future employees. Upon passage of the 2024\nSecond Incentive Plan Amendment and Restatement there will be a total of 2,000,000 Class A shares and 7,000,000 Class\nD shares available for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan.\nEligible Participants in the Plan\nParticipants in the 2019 Incentive Plan may include any director, executive or other key employee of the\nCompany, or any other individual who performs substantial work for or provides services to the Company, who is granted\nan award in accordance with the terms of the 2019 Incentive Plan by the Compensation Committee.\nTypes of Equity Awards the Company May Issue Under the Plan\nStock Options. A stock option is the right to purchase shares of common stock at a future date at a specified price\nper share called the exercise price. An option may be either an ISO or a nonqualified stock option. ISOs and nonqualified\nstock options are taxed differently, as described under Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards. Except in the case of\noptions granted pursuant to an assumption or substitution for another option, the exercise price of a stock option may not be\nless than the fair market value (or in the case of an ISO granted to a ten percent stockholder, 110% of the fair market value)\nof a share of common stock on the grant date. As of August 12, 2024, the record date, the closing price of our Class A\ncommon stock was $2.00 and the closing price of our Class D common stock was $1.31 Full payment of the exercise price\nmust be made at the time of such exercise either in cash or bank check or in another manner approved by the Committee.\nRestricted Stock Grants. A restricted stock award is an award of actual shares of common stock which are subject\nto certain restrictions for a period of time determined by the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock may be held by the\nCompany in escrow or delivered to the participant pending the release of the restrictions. Participants who receive\nrestricted stock awards generally have the rights and privileges of stockholders regarding the shares of restricted stock\nduring the restricted period, including the right to vote and the right to receive dividends.\nImpact of a Change in Control\nThe Compensation Committee may provide for the acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of outstanding\noptions, vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, other\nstock awards, in the event of a change in control of the Company.\nFederal Income Tax Consequences of Awards\nThe following is a summary of U.S. federal income tax consequences of awards granted under the Plan, based on\ncurrent U.S. federal income tax laws. This summary does not constitute legal or tax advice and does not address municipal,\nstate or foreign income tax consequences.\nNonqualified Stock Options\nThe grant of a nonqualified stock option will not result in taxable income to the participant. The participant will\nrecognize ordinary income at the time of exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of\nexercise over the exercise price and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction for tax purposes. Gains or\nlosses realized by the participant upon the sale of the shares acquired on exercise will be treated as capital gains or losses.\nIncentive Stock Options\nThe grant of an ISO will not result in taxable income to the participant. The exercise of an ISO will not result in\ntaxable income to the participant if at the time of exercise the participant has been employed by the Company or its\nsubsidiaries at all times beginning on the date the ISO was granted and ending not more than 90 days before the date of\nexercise. However, the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price is an\nadjustment that is included in the calculation of the participant’s alternative minimum tax liability for the year the shares\nare sold.\nIf the participant does not sell the shares acquired on exercise within two years from the date of grant and one year\nfrom the date of exercise then on the sale of the shares any amount realized in excess of the exercise price will be taxed as\ncapital gain. If the amount realized in the sale is less than the exercise price, then the participant will recognize a capital\nloss. If these holding requirements are not met, then the participant will generally recognize ordinary income at the time the\nshares are sold in an amount equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of\nexercise over the exercise price, or (b) the excess, if any, of the amount realized on the sale of the shares over the exercise\nprice, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction.\nRestricted Stock\nUnless a participant makes an election to accelerate the recognition of income to the grant date, the grant of\nrestricted stock or performance shares awards will not result in taxable income to the participant. When the restrictions\nlapse, the participant will recognize ordinary income on the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the vesting date\nover the amount paid for the shares, if any, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction.\nIf the participant makes an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code within thirty days after the\ngrant date, the participant will recognize ordinary income as of the grant date equal to the fair market value of the shares on\nthe grant date over the amount paid, if any, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Any future\nappreciation will be taxed at capital gains rates. However, if the shares are later forfeited, the participant will not be able to\nrecover any taxes paid.\nSection 409A\nSection 409A of the Code imposes complex rules on nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements, including\nrequirements with respect to elections to defer compensation and the timing of payment of deferred amounts. Depending on\nhow they are structured, certain equity-based awards may be subject to Section 409A of the Code, while others are exempt.\nIf an award is subject to Section 409A of the Code and a violation occurs, the compensation is includible in income when\nno longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and the participant may be subject to a 20% penalty tax and, in some\ncases, interest penalties.

Performance Measures may be established in terms of objectives that\nare related to the individual Participant or that are Company-wide or related to a subsidiary, division, department, region,\nfunction or business unit and may be measured on an absolute or cumulative basis or on the basis of percentage of\nimprovement over time, and may be measured in terms of Company performance (or performance of the applicable\nSubsidiary, division, department, region, function or business unit) or measured relative to selected reference companies or\na market index.\nARTICLE 12.\nBENEFICIARY DESIGNATION\nEach Participant under the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named\ncontingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she\nreceives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall\nbe in a form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the\nCompany during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the\nParticipant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate.\nARTICLE 13.\nDEFERRALS\nTo the extent permitted by the Section 409A Rules, the Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer such\nParticipant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by\nvirtue of the exercise of an Option, the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock\nUnits, or the satisfaction of any requirements or performance goals with respect to Performance Shares, Performance Units,\nCash-Based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards. If any such deferral election is required or permitted, the Committee\nshall, in its sole discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment deferrals, consistent with the Section 409A\nRules.\nARTICLE 14.\nRIGHTS OF PARTICIPANTS\n14.1 Employment.

All such elections\nshall be irrevocable, made in writing, and signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations\nthat the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries, and/\nor Affiliates under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company, a\nSubsidiary, or an Affiliate, as the case may be. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of\nthe Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate, as the case may be and no special or separate fund shall be established and no\nsegregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan.

The adoption of this Plan shall not be construed as creating any limitations on the\npower of the Board or Committee to adopt such other compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable for any\nParticipant.\n19.14 No Constraint on Corporate Action. Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to: (i) limit, impair, or otherwise\naffect the Company's or a Subsidiary's or an Affiliate's right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications,\nreorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or\ntransfer all or any part of its business or assets; or, (ii) limit the right or power of the Company or a Subsidiary or an\nAffiliate to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate.\n19.15 Governing Law. The Plan and each Evidence of Award shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware,\nexcluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the\nPlan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Evidence of Award, recipients of an\nAward under the Plan are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of\nDelaware, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to the Plan or any related Evidence of Award.\n19.16 No Liability of the Company. The Company and any Subsidiary or Affiliate which is in existence or hereafter\ncomes into existence shall not be liable to a Participant or any other person as to: (i) the non-issuance or sale of Shares as to\nwhich the Company has been unable to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction or authority deemed by the\nCompany's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder; and (ii) any tax consequence\nexpected, but not realized, by any Participant or other person due to the receipt, exercise or settlement of any Award\ngranted hereunder.\n19.17 No Representations on Covenants with Respect to Tax Qualification. Although the Company may endeavor to\nqualify an Award for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United\nStates or to avoid adverse tax treatment, the Company makes no representation to the effect and expressly disavows any\ncovenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan and\nthe Company will have no liability to a Participant or to any other party if a payment under an Award that is intended to\nbenefit from favorable tax treatment or avoid adverse tax treatment fails to realize such intention or for any action taken by\nthe Committee with respect to such Award. The Company shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities and may engage\nin such activities without regard to the potential negative impact on holders of Awards under the Plan.\n19.18 No Obligation to Notify. Neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any duty or obligation to any\nholder of any Award to advise such holder as to the time or manner of exercising such Award. Furthermore, neither the\nCompany nor the Committee shall have any duty or obligation to warn or otherwise advise such holder of a pending\ntermination or expiration of an Award or a possible period in which the Award may not be exercised.
