Diluted earnings per share increased 20.0% and increased 26.3% for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively.\n\n**President's Comments**\n\nGarry Kleer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our net income increased during the quarter primarily due to an increase in our noninterest income, which resulted from an increase in net gains on loan and lease sales. Additionally, the performance of our loan and lease portfolio improved, as nonperforming assets declined during the period. We anticipate further improvements in credit quality if market interest rates continue to decrease.\"\n\n**_Third Quarter Performance Highlights_** :\n\n  * Assets totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n  * Loans and leases, net of allowance for credit losses, totaled $1.1 billion at September 30, 2024, June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n  * Nonperforming loans and leases totaled $6.7 million, or 0.58% of total loans and leases, at September 30, 2024, compared to $7.7 million, or 0.67% of total loans and leases, at June 30, 2024, and $8.0 million, or 0.72% of total loans and leases, at December 31, 2023.\n  * The allowance for credit losses totaled $15.8 million, or 1.36% of total loans and leases outstanding, at September 30, 2024, compared to $15.9 million, or 1.37% of total loans and leases outstanding, at June 30, 2024, and $15.7 million, or 1.42% of total loans and leases outstanding, at December 31, 2023.\n  * A reversal for credit losses was recognized in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of $99,000, compared to provisions of $270,000 in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $50,000 in the third quarter of 2023.\n  * Deposits totaled $1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits totaled $98.5 million or 9.0% of total deposits, compared to $102.8 million or 9.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2024, and $114.4 million or 11.0% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, approximately $224.6 million, or 20.6%, of our deposit portfolio, excluding collateralized public deposits, was uninsured.\n  * Stockholders' equity totaled $140.0 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $131.1 million at June 30, 2024 and $134.9 million at December 31, 2023. The Company's equity to assets ratio was 9.38% at September 30, 2024.\n  * Book value per share and tangible book value per share were $12.79 at September 30, 2024, compared to $11.90 per share at June 30, 2024 and $12.03 per share at December 31, 2023.\n  * Net interest income decreased $143,000, or 1.5%, to $9.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $9.6 million for the prior quarter, and increased $305,000, or 3.3%, from $9.1 million for the comparable quarter in 2023.\n  * Annualized net interest margin was 2.60% for the current quarter, compared to 2.64% in the preceding quarter and 2.66% for the comparable quarter in 2023.\n  * The Company repurchased 71,306 shares of common stock at an average price of $12.42 per share during the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n  * The Bank's Tier 1 capital to total assets was 10.73%, well in excess of all regulatory requirements at September 30, 2024.\n\n\n\n**Income Statement Summary**\n\nNet interest income before the (recovery of)/provision for credit losses decreased $143,000, or 1.5%, to $9.4 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to $9.6 million in the second quarter of 2024, and increased $305,000, or 3.3%, from $9.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease from the second quarter of 2024 was due to a seven basis point decrease in the average interest rate spread, partially offset by a $4.2 million increase in average net earning assets. The increase from the comparable quarter in 2023 was due to an $80.0 million increase in average interest earning assets, partially offset by a 13 basis point decrease in the average interest rate spread. Between March 2022 and January 2024, in response to continuing elevated inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates a total of 11 times, to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% until September 18, 2024 when the rates were reduced to the range of 4.75% to 5.00%. While interest income benefited from the repricing impact of the higher interest rate environment on earning asset yields, the benefits were offset by the higher cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts and borrowings, which tend to be shorter in duration than our assets and re-price or reset faster than assets.\n\nInterest income increased $176,000, or 0.9%, to $20.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $2.8 million, or 16.4%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023.\n\nInterest income on loans and leases increased $260,000, or 1.5%, to $18.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $17.8 million in the second quarter of 2024, due to a $3.9 million increase in the average balance of loans and leases, and an increase of seven basis points to 6.27% in the average yield earned on loans and leases. Interest income on loans and leases increased $2.8 million, or 18.3%, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, due to an increase in the average balance of loans and leases of $84.3 million and an increase of 56 basis points in the average yield earned on loans and leases.\n\nInterest income on investment securities, excluding FHLB stock, decreased $34,000, or 2.0%, to $1.7 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and decreased $102,000, or 5.7%, from the comparable quarter in 2023. The decrease compared to the second quarter of 2024 was due to a $2.3 million decrease in the average balance and a three basis point decrease in the average yield earned on investment securities. The decrease compared to the third quarter of 2023 was due to a $12.7 million decrease in the average balance, primarily as a result of proceeds received from maturities and paydowns on securities being used to fund loan growth, and a three basis point decrease in the average yield earned on investment securities. Dividends on FHLB stock decreased $20,000, or 6.2%, to $302,000 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $63,000, or 26.4%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to changes in the amount of FHLB stock held during the periods. Interest income on cash and cash equivalents decreased $30,000, or 13.6%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $86,000, or 84.3%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income on cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of 2024 from the second quarter of 2024 was due to a nine basis point decrease in the average yield and a $618,000 decrease in the average balance. The increase in interest income on cash and cash equivalents in the third quarter of 2024 from the third quarter of 2023 was due to an 81 basis point increase in the average yield along with a $5.5 million increase in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nInterest expense increased $319,000, or 3.0%, to $10.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $2.5 million, or 30.7%, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense on deposits increased $330,000, or 4.1%, to $8.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the previous quarter and increased $2.0 million, or 31.9%, from the comparable quarter in 2023. The increase from the previous quarter was primarily due to a 10 basis point increase in the average rate paid on, and a $9.8 million increase in the average balances of, interest-bearing deposits. The increase from the comparable quarter in 2023 was due to an increase of $61.8 million in average balance of, and a 64 basis point increase in the average rate paid on, interest-bearing deposits. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits was 3.33% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.23% and 2.69% for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.\n\nInterest expense on FHLB borrowings decreased $11,000, or 0.5%, to $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the previous quarter and increased $529,000, or 26.9%, from the comparable quarter in 2023. The decrease from the previous quarter was primarily due to a $13.1 million decrease in the average balance of FHLB borrowing, partially offset by a 19 basis point increase in the average rate paid. The increase from the comparable quarter in 2023 was primarily due to an increase of 58 basis points in the average rate paid on FHLB borrowings and an increase in the average balance of FHLB borrowings of $20.0 million. The average balance of FHLB borrowings totaled $244.8 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $257.9 million and $224.8 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The average rate paid on FHLB borrowings was 4.08% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, 3.89% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 3.50% for the third quarter of 2023.\n\nAnnualized net interest margin decreased to 2.60% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.64% for the second quarter of 2024, and from 2.66% for the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily due to greater increases in the rates paid and average balances of our interest-bearing liabilities as compared to our interest-earning assets.\n\nA reversal of the provision for credit losses of $99,000 was recognized in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $270,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and $50,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs during the third quarter of 2024 were $464,000, compared to $450,000 during the second quarter of 2024 and $299,000 during the third quarter of 2023. The reversal of provision for credit losses during the quarter was due to the availability of increased details within certain loan categories, which allowed for more precise risk profiling. Additionally, macroeconomic inputs, credit metrics, and refreshed loss driver data were updated to further refine our allowance calculation.\n\nNoninterest income increased $213,000, or 19.2%, to $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $168,000, or 14.5%, from the comparable quarter in 2023. The increase in noninterest income from the second quarter of 2024 primarily resulted from an increase in net gains on loan and lease sales, which increased $121,000, or 133.7%, to $211,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $15,000, or 5.1%, to $325,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $310,000 for the second quarter of 2024. Other income increased $13,000, or 3.8%, to $354,000 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $341,000 in the previous quarter. The increase in noninterest income from the comparable quarter in 2023 was primarily due to an increase in net gains on loan and lease sales and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease in other income. Net gains on loan and lease sales increased $122,000, or 135.8%, compared to the same quarter in 2023, due to increased mortgage banking activity. Service fees on deposit accounts increased $51,000, or 18.5%, in the third quarter of 2024 from the comparable quarter in 2023, due to higher transaction activity and early withdraw fees, coupled with year-over-year deposit growth. Other income decreased $24,000, or 6.3%, to $354,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $378,000 for the comparable quarter in 2023 due to fees earned from our participation in a loan hedging program with a correspondent bank in 2023.\n\nTotal noninterest expense decreased $36,000, or 0.5%, to $8.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024, and increased $3,000 compared to the same period in 2023. Salaries and employee benefits decreased $91,000, or 2.0%, to $4.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024, and increased $204,000 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in salaries and benefits from the second quarter of 2024 was primarily a result of a reduction in the number of full-time equivalent employees due to employee retirements, while the increase from the third quarter of 2023 was due to increased compensation and insurance expenses. Deposit insurance expense remained flat at $380,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024, and increased $100,000, or 35.7%, from the comparable quarter in 2023 primarily due to changes in the asset and deposit mix. Legal and professional fees decreased $18,000, or 3.7%, to $463,000 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $65,000, or 12.3%, from the comparable quarter in 2023 primarily due to decreased accounting and audit expenses. Other expenses increased $44,000, or 5.1%, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior quarter, and decreased $236,000, or 20.4%, compared to the same quarter of 2023. The decrease in other expenses from the comparable quarter of 2023 primarily was due to a reduction in losses due to fraud, and a decrease in loan closing expenses.\n\nIncome tax expense increased $64,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and increased $95,000 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2023, due to increases in pre-tax income. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was 13.0%, compared to 12.9% and 12.3% in the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter a year ago, respectively.\n\n**Balance Sheet Summary**\n\nTotal assets increased $31.5 million, or 2.2%, to $1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of a $50.9 million, or 4.7%, increase in loans and leases, net of allowance for credit losses, to $1.1 billion, partially offset by a $16.3 million, or 5.7%, decrease in investment securities to $271.3 million at September 30, 2024.\n\nThe increase in loans and leases was attributable to an increase in multi-family loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgage loans, and commercial real estate loans of $45.0 million, $11.2 million, $10.8 million and $6.8 million, respectively.\n\nNonperforming loans and leases, consisting of nonaccrual loans and leases and accruing loans and leases more than 90 days past due, totaled $6.7 million, or 0.58% of total loans and leases, at September 30, 2024, compared to $8.0 million, or 0.72%, at December 31, 2023. Accruing loans past due more than 90 days totaled $1.6 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $1.7 million at December 31, 2023.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans and leases increased $110,000, or 0.7%, to $15.8 million at September 30, 2024 from $15.7 million at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases totaled 1.36% of total loans and leases outstanding, compared to 1.42% at December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs during the first nine months of 2024 were $1.2 million, compared to net charge-offs of $436,000 during the comparable period of 2023.\n\nManagement regularly analyzes conditions within its geographic markets and evaluates its loan and lease portfolio. The Company evaluated its exposure to potential credit losses as of September 30, 2024, which included consideration of a potential recession due to inflation, stock market volatility, and overall geopolitical tensions. Credit metrics are being reviewed and stress testing is being performed on the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis.\n\nInvestment securities decreased $16.3 million, or 5.7%, to $271.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $287.6 million at December 31, 2023. Investment securities decreased primarily due to $14.6 million in maturities and principal repayments and the sale of $6.9 million of available-for-sale securities. The proceeds received from maturities, repayments, and sales of securities were used to fund loan growth.\n\nTotal deposits increased $48.0 million, or 4.6%, to $1.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2023 primarily was due to an increase in non-brokered time deposits of $41.6 million, which were used primarily to fund loan demand, and savings and money-market accounts of $27.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in demand deposit accounts of $31.4 million. Brokered time deposits totaled $279.6 million, or 25.7% of total deposits, at September 30, 2024, compared to $268.8 million, or 25.8% of total deposits at December 31, 2023. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits decreased $15.9 million to $98.5 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $114.4 million at December 31, 2023, and totaled 9.0% of total deposits at September 30, 2024. Management attributes the shift in funds from transaction accounts to retail certificates of deposit to customers taking advantage of higher rates being paid on time deposits as a result of interest rate hikes enacted by the Federal Reserve.\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, approximately $224.6 million of our deposit portfolio, or 20.6% of total deposits, excluding collateralized public deposits, was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for First Bank Richmond's regulatory reporting requirements.\n\nStockholders' equity totaled $140.0 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of $5.2 million, or 3.8%, from December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders' equity primarily was the result of net income of $6.9 million and a $4.1 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, partially offset by the payment of $4.3 million in dividends to Company stockholders, and the repurchase of $3.1 million of Company common stock.\n\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 71,306 shares of Company common stock at an average price of $12.42 per share. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 606,802 shares available for repurchase under its existing stock repurchase program. Subsequent to quarter end, the Company repurchased an additional 22,084 shares.\n\n**About Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc.**\n\nRichmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc., headquartered in Richmond, Indiana, is the holding company for First Bank Richmond, a community-oriented financial institution offering traditional financial and trust services within its local communities through its eight locations in Richmond, Centerville, Cambridge City and Shelbyville, Indiana, its five locations in Sidney, Piqua and Troy, Ohio, and its loan production office in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n**_FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:_**\n\n_This document and other filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), as well as press releases or other public or stockholder communications released by the Company, may contain forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, (i) statements regarding the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company, (ii) statements about the Company's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts and (iii) other statements identified by the words or phrases \"will likely result,\" \"are expected to,\" \"will continue,\" \"is anticipated,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"intends\" or similar expressions that are intended to identify \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
