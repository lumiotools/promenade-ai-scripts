(NASDAQ: RCKY) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Overview**\n\n  * Net sales decreased 8.8% to $114.6 million versus the year-ago quarter, or 2.4%, excluding certain non-recurring sales from the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n---  \n  \n  * Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 38.1% compared to 37.0% in the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Operating income was $10.1 million as compared to $14.3 million in the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Net income was $5.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, as compared to $6.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Adjusted net income was $5.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, as compared to $8.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Inventories at September 30, 2024 decreased 11.8% year-over-year \n\n  \n  \n  * Total debt at September 30, 2024 decreased 29.7% year-over-year \n\n  \n  \n\"While cautious consumer spending outside of peak shopping periods and warm, dry weather acted as headwinds this quarter, the underlying strength of our business remains intact,\" said Jason Brooks, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The benefits of our multi-brand, multi-channel model were evident in the third quarter as double digit sales growth in both our Durango brand and our Lehigh CustomFit safety footwear platform partially offset Wholesale declines primarily within our work, outdoor and commercial military categories. Based on our current order book for 2025, we believe this softness is transitory and that recent brand and marketing investments, along with our improved capital structure, have the Company well positioned to drive sustainable, profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.\" \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Review**\n\nThird quarter net sales decreased 8.8% to $114.6 million compared with $125.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding certain non-recurring sales relating to the manufacturing of Servus product following the divestiture of the Servus brand, the change to a distributor model in Canada in November 2023, and temporarily elevated commercial military footwear sales to a single customer throughout 2023, net sales decreased 2.4% year-over-year. Wholesale sales for the third quarter were $84.0 million, down 15.7% compared to the third quarter of 2023, or 9.7% excluding the aforementioned non-recurring sales. Retail sales for the third quarter increased 9.2%, or 11.8% excluding the non-recurring sales related to the change in the Canadian distribution model, to $26.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Contract Manufacturing sales were $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.4 million in the prior year period, or up $3.4 million excluding the aforementioned non-recurring sales. \n\nGross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was $43.6 million, or 38.1% of net sales, compared to $46.5 million, or 37.0% of net sales, for the same period last year. The 110-basis point increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was due to a higher mix of Retail segment sales which carry higher gross margins than the Wholesale and Contract Manufacturing segments. \n\nOperating expenses were $33.6 million, or 29.3% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $32.3 million, or 25.7% of net sales, for the same period a year ago. Excluding $0.7 million of acquisition-related amortization in the third quarter of 2024 and $1.5 million of costs related to closure of a manufacturing facility, acquisition-related amortization, and restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2023, adjusted operating expenses were $32.9 million in the current year period and $30.7 million in the year-ago period. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental brand building and advertising programs to support future growth. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating expense were 28.7% in the third quarter 2024 compared with 24.5% in the year-ago period. \n\nIncome from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.1 million, or 8.8% of net sales compared to $14.3 million or 11.4% of net sales for the same period a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.8 million, or 9.4% of net sales compared to adjusted operating income of $15.8 million, or 12.6% of net sales a year ago. \n\nInterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.3 million compared with $5.8 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower debt levels and interest rates as a result of the debt refinancing completed in April 2024. \n\nThe Company reported third quarter net income of $5.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $6.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $8.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. \n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $3.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $4.2 million on the same date a year ago. \n\nInventories at September 30, 2024 were $171.8 million, down 11.8% from $194.7 million on the same date a year ago. \n\nTotal debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.4 million, at September 30, 2024 was $150.3 million consisting of a $47.2 million senior term loan and $105.5 million of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. Compared with September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, total debt at September 30, 2024 was down 29.7% and 13.2%, respectively. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company's conference call to review third quarter 2024 results will be broadcast live over the internet today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 4:30 pm Eastern Time.

net,\" \"non-GAAP adjusted net income,\" and \"non-GAAP adjusted net income per share.\" Adjusted results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our consolidated financial statements in the periods presented. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to management and investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance. We believe they also provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. \n\nInvestors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. See \"Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\" accompanying this press release. \n\n**Non-GAAP adjustment or measure** |  **Definition** |  **Usefulness to management and investors**  \n---|---|---  \nReturns relating to supplier dispute  |  Returns relating to supplier dispute consist of returns of product produced by a manufacturing supplier.  |  We excluded these returns for calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these returns are inconsistent in size with our normal course of business and were unique to a resolved dispute with a manufacturing supplier. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate net sales trends.   \nSupplier dispute inventory adjustment  |  Supplier dispute inventory adjustment consists of an inventory adjustment to cost of goods sold for product produced by a manufacturing supplier.  |  We excluded this inventory adjustment to cost of goods sold for calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment is noncustomary and was unique to a resolved dispute with a manufacturing supplier. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance and provides investors with additional means to evaluate net cost of goods sold trends.   \nAcquisition-related amortization  |  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as brands and customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of the performance and lifestyle footwear business of Honeywell International Inc. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded in operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.  |  We excluded amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the valuation of our acquisition. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.   \nClosure of Manufacturing Facility  |  Closure of manufacturing facility relates to the expenses and overhead incurred associated with closing our Rock Island manufacturing facility.  |  We excluded costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing facility for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures because these costs did not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitated a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating results and provided investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.   \nRestructuring Costs  |  Restructuring costs represent severance expenses associated with headcount reductions following the integration of the acquired performance and lifestyle footwear business of Honeywell International Inc. in 2022 and the sale of Servus in 2023.  |  We excluded restructuring costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our current operating performance.

(NASDAQ: RCKY) today\nannounced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\nThird Quarter 2024 Overview\nNet sales decreased 8.8% to $114.6 million versus the year-ago quarter, or 2.4%, excluding certain non-recurring sales from\nthe year-ago quarter\nGross margin increased 110 basis points to 38.1% compared to 37.0% in the year-ago quarter\nOperating income was $10.1 million as compared to $14.3 million in the year-ago quarter\nNet income was $5.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, as compared to $6.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the year-\nago quarter\nAdjusted net income was $5.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, as compared to $8.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for\nthe year-ago quarter\nInventories at September 30, 2024 decreased 11.8% year-over-year\nTotal debt at September 30, 2024 decreased 29.7% year-over-year\n\"While cautious consumer spending outside of peak shopping periods and warm, dry\nweather acted as headwinds this quarter, the underlying strength of our business remains\nintact,\" said Jason Brooks, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The benefits of\nour multi-brand, multi-channel model were evident in the third quarter as double digit sales\ngrowth in both our Durango brand and our Lehigh CustomFit safety footwear platform\npartially offset Wholesale declines primarily within our work, outdoor and commercial military\ncategories. Based on our current order book for 2025, we believe this softness is transitory\nand that recent brand and marketing investments, along with our improved capital structure,\nhave the Company well positioned to drive sustainable, profitable growth and long-term\nshareholder value.\"\nThird Quarter 2024 Review\nThird quarter net sales decreased 8.8% to $114.6 million compared with $125.6 million in\nthe third quarter of 2023. Excluding certain non-recurring sales relating to the manufacturing\nof Servus product following the divestiture of the Servus brand, the change to a distributor\nmodel in Canada in November 2023, and temporarily elevated commercial military footwear\nsales to a single customer throughout 2023, net sales decreased 2.4% year-over-year.\nWholesale sales for the third quarter were $84.0 million, down 15.7% compared to the third\nquarter of 2023, or 9.7% excluding the aforementioned non-recurring sales. Retail sales for\nthe third quarter increased 9.2%, or 11.8% excluding the non-recurring sales related to the\nchange in the Canadian distribution model, to $26.8 million compared to the third quarter of\n2023. Contract Manufacturing sales were $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared\nto $1.4 million in the prior year period, or up $3.4 million excluding the aforementioned non-\nrecurring sales.\nGross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was $43.6 million, or 38.1% of net sales, compared\nto $46.5 million, or 37.0% of net sales, for the same period last year. The 110-basis point\nincrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was due to a higher mix of Retail\nsegment sales which carry higher gross margins than the Wholesale and Contract\nManufacturing segments.\nOperating expenses were $33.6 million, or 29.3% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024\ncompared to $32.3 million, or 25.7% of net sales, for the same period a year ago. Excluding\n$0.7 million of acquisition-related amortization in the third quarter of 2024 and $1.5 million of\ncosts related to closure of a manufacturing facility, acquisition-related amortization, and\nrestructuring costs in the third quarter of 2023, adjusted operating expenses were $32.9\nmillion in the current year period and $30.7 million in the year-ago period. This increase was\nprimarily attributable to incremental brand building and advertising programs to support\nfuture growth. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating expense were 28.7% in the\nthird quarter 2024 compared with 24.5% in the year-ago period.\nIncome from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.1 million, or 8.8% of net sales\ncompared to $14.3 million or 11.4% of net sales for the same period a year ago. Adjusted\noperating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.8 million, or 9.4% of net sales\ncompared to adjusted operating income of $15.8 million, or 12.6% of net sales a year ago.\nInterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.3 million compared with $5.8 million a\nyear ago. The decrease was driven by lower debt levels and interest rates as a result of the\ndebt refinancing completed in April 2024.\nThe Company reported third quarter net income of $5.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share\ncompared to $6.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted\nnet income for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share,\ncompared to $8.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, in the year-ago period.\nBalance Sheet Review\nCash and cash equivalents were $3.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $4.2\nmillion on the same date a year ago.\nInventories at September 30, 2024 were $171.8 million, down 11.8% from $194.7 million on\nthe same date a year ago.\nTotal debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.4 million, at September 30, 2024\nwas $150.3 million consisting of a $47.2 million senior term loan and $105.5 million of\nborrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility.

(NASDAQ: RCKY) today announced financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024. \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Overview**\n\n  * Net sales decreased 8.8% to $114.6 million versus the year-ago quarter, or 2.4%, excluding certain non-recurring sales from the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n---  \n  \n  * Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 38.1% compared to 37.0% in the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Operating income was $10.1 million as compared to $14.3 million in the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Net income was $5.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share, as compared to $6.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Adjusted net income was $5.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, as compared to $8.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the year-ago quarter \n\n  \n  \n  * Inventories at September 30, 2024 decreased 11.8% year-over-year \n\n  \n  \n  * Total debt at September 30, 2024 decreased 29.7% year-over-year \n\n  \n  \n\"While cautious consumer spending outside of peak shopping periods and warm, dry weather acted as headwinds this quarter, the underlying strength of our business remains intact,\" said Jason Brooks, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The benefits of our multi-brand, multi-channel model were evident in the third quarter as double digit sales growth in both our Durango brand and our Lehigh CustomFit safety footwear platform partially offset Wholesale declines primarily within our work, outdoor and commercial military categories. Based on our current order book for 2025, we believe this softness is transitory and that recent brand and marketing investments, along with our improved capital structure, have the Company well positioned to drive sustainable, profitable growth and long-term shareholder value.\" \n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Review**\n\nThird quarter net sales decreased 8.8% to $114.6 million compared with $125.6 million in the third quarter of 2023. Excluding certain non-recurring sales relating to the manufacturing of Servus product following the divestiture of the Servus brand, the change to a distributor model in Canada in November 2023, and temporarily elevated commercial military footwear sales to a single customer throughout 2023, net sales decreased 2.4% year-over-year. Wholesale sales for the third quarter were $84.0 million, down 15.7% compared to the third quarter of 2023, or 9.7% excluding the aforementioned non-recurring sales. Retail sales for the third quarter increased 9.2%, or 11.8% excluding the non-recurring sales related to the change in the Canadian distribution model, to $26.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Contract Manufacturing sales were $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $1.4 million in the prior year period, or up $3.4 million excluding the aforementioned non-recurring sales. \n\nGross margin in the third quarter of 2024 was $43.6 million, or 38.1% of net sales, compared to $46.5 million, or 37.0% of net sales, for the same period last year. The 110-basis point increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was due to a higher mix of Retail segment sales which carry higher gross margins than the Wholesale and Contract Manufacturing segments. \n\nOperating expenses were $33.6 million, or 29.3% of net sales, for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $32.3 million, or 25.7% of net sales, for the same period a year ago. Excluding $0.7 million of acquisition-related amortization in the third quarter of 2024 and $1.5 million of costs related to closure of a manufacturing facility, acquisition-related amortization, and restructuring costs in the third quarter of 2023, adjusted operating expenses were $32.9 million in the current year period and $30.7 million in the year-ago period. This increase was primarily attributable to incremental brand building and advertising programs to support future growth. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted operating expense were 28.7% in the third quarter 2024 compared with 24.5% in the year-ago period. \n\nIncome from operations for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.1 million, or 8.8% of net sales compared to $14.3 million or 11.4% of net sales for the same period a year ago. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter of 2024 was $10.8 million, or 9.4% of net sales compared to adjusted operating income of $15.8 million, or 12.6% of net sales a year ago. \n\nInterest expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $3.3 million compared with $5.8 million a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower debt levels and interest rates as a result of the debt refinancing completed in April 2024. \n\nThe Company reported third quarter net income of $5.3 million, or $0.70 per diluted share compared to $6.8 million, or $0.93 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $5.8 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $8.0 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. \n\n**Balance Sheet Review**\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $3.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to $4.2 million on the same date a year ago. \n\nInventories at September 30, 2024 were $171.8 million, down 11.8% from $194.7 million on the same date a year ago. \n\nTotal debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $2.4 million, at September 30, 2024 was $150.3 million consisting of a $47.2 million senior term loan and $105.5 million of borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility. Compared with September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, total debt at September 30, 2024 was down 29.7% and 13.2%, respectively. \n\n**Conference Call Information**\n\nThe Company's conference call to review third quarter 2024 results will be broadcast live over the internet today, Wednesday, October 30, 2024 at 4:30 pm Eastern Time.

net,\" \"non-GAAP adjusted net income,\" and \"non-GAAP adjusted net income per share.\" Adjusted results exclude the impact of items that management believes affect the comparability or underlying business trends in our consolidated financial statements in the periods presented. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to management and investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool for evaluating operating performance. We believe they also provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. \n\nInvestors should not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. See \"Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\" accompanying this press release. \n\n**Non-GAAP adjustment or measure** |  **Definition** |  **Usefulness to management and investors**  \n---|---|---  \nReturns relating to supplier dispute  |  Returns relating to supplier dispute consist of returns of product produced by a manufacturing supplier.  |  We excluded these returns for calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these returns are inconsistent in size with our normal course of business and were unique to a resolved dispute with a manufacturing supplier. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate net sales trends.   \nSupplier dispute inventory adjustment  |  Supplier dispute inventory adjustment consists of an inventory adjustment to cost of goods sold for product produced by a manufacturing supplier.  |  We excluded this inventory adjustment to cost of goods sold for calculating certain non-GAAP measures because this adjustment is noncustomary and was unique to a resolved dispute with a manufacturing supplier. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance and provides investors with additional means to evaluate net cost of goods sold trends.   \nAcquisition-related amortization  |  Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as brands and customer relationships acquired in connection with the acquisition of the performance and lifestyle footwear business of Honeywell International Inc. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded in operating expenses in our GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years.  |  We excluded amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the valuation of our acquisition. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.   \nClosure of Manufacturing Facility  |  Closure of manufacturing facility relates to the expenses and overhead incurred associated with closing our Rock Island manufacturing facility.  |  We excluded costs associated with the closure of our manufacturing facility for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures because these costs did not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitated a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to past operating results and provided investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.   \nRestructuring Costs  |  Restructuring costs represent severance expenses associated with headcount reductions following the integration of the acquired performance and lifestyle footwear business of Honeywell International Inc. in 2022 and the sale of Servus in 2023.  |  We excluded restructuring costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operations performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.   \nTerm debt extinguishment costs  |  Term debt extinguishment costs relate to the loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt during the second quarter 2024. The prepayment penalty associated with the early termination of the term debt, as well as the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees of the term debt, was recorded as expense within Interest Expense and Other - net accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  |  We excluded these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures because these costs do not reflect our current operating performance. This adjustment is a one-time cost for refinancing the term debt and is not reoccurring. This adjustment facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operations performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate expense trends.   \nGain on sale of business  |  Gain on sale of business relates to the sale of the brand Servus. This includes the disposal of non-financial assets and corresponding expenses relating to the sale of the brand along with assets held at our Rock Island manufacturing facility.  |  We excluded the disposition of non-financial assets and related expenses for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because the gain does not accurately reflect our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost trends.   \n  \nView source version on businesswire.com: <https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030135433/en/>\n\nCompany Contact: Tom Robertson Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (740) 753-9100 Investor Relations: Brendon Frey ICR, Inc.

As of December 31, 2023, our products were offered for\nsale at over 10,000 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as several international markets, such as Europe.\nWe sell to wholesale accounts in the U.S. through the use of a dedicated in-house sales team, and exclusive, as well as\nindependent, sales representatives who carry our branded products and other non-competing products. Our sales force is\norganized around major accounts, including Boot Barn, Tractor Supply Company and Amazon, and around our target markets:\noutdoor, work, duty, commercial military, and western. Our sales force is also organized around brands, regions and customers\nin order to target a broad range of distribution channels. All of our sales people actively call on their retail customer base to\neducate them on the quality, comfort, technical features and breadth of our product lines and to ensure that our products are\ndisplayed effectively at retail locations.\nOur Wholesale distribution channels vary by market:\n● Our outdoor products are sold primarily through sporting goods stores, outdoor specialty stores, online retailers,\ncatalogs and mass merchants;\n● Our work-related products are sold primarily through work-related retailers, farm and ranch stores, specialty safety\nstores, independent shoe stores, hardware stores and online retailers;\n● Our duty products are sold primarily through uniform stores, catalog specialists and online retailers;\n2\n● Our commercial military products are sold primarily through base exchanges, such as the Army Air Force Exchange\nStore (AAFES), and consumer e-commerce websites; and\n● Our western products are sold through western stores, work stores, specialty farm and ranch stores, online retailers, and\nfashion-oriented footwear retailers.\nRetail\nWe market products directly to consumers through three retail strategies:\n● Lehigh business-to-business including direct sales and through our CustomFit websites;\n● Consumer e-commerce websites (B2C) and third-party marketplaces; and\n● Brick and Mortar Stores, which include our outdoor gear and retail store.\nLehigh\nWe sell our Lehigh brand of safety shoes along with in-house and third-party branded work product to our business customers\ndirectly through our CustomFit websites, that are tailored to the specific needs of our customers.

We believe\nthat our internet presence allows us to showcase the breadth and depth of our product lines in each of our target markets and\nenables us to educate our consumers about the unique technical features of our products.\nOutdoor Gear and Retail Store\nWe operate the Rocky Outdoor Gear Store in Nelsonville, Ohio. Our outdoor gear store primarily sells first quality current\nand discontinued products in addition to a limited amount of factory damaged goods. Related products from other manufacturers\nare also sold in the store. Our outdoor gear store allows us to showcase the breadth of our product lines as well as to cost-\neffectively sell slow-moving inventory. Our outdoor gear store also provides an opportunity to interact with consumers to better\nunderstand their needs. Additionally, Lehigh has one retail store located at the Puget Sound Naval Base where we sell select\nproduct directly to customers.\nContract Manufacturing\nWhile we are focused on continuing to build our Wholesale and Retail business, we also actively bid, from time to time, on\neligible footwear contracts with the U.S. Military. In addition to contracts with the U.S. Military, we bid on private label\ncontracts. Our sales under such contracts are dependent on us winning the bids for these contracts.\nIn 2023, we fulfilled two multi-year contracts for the U.S. Military. We expect to continue to actively bid on U.S. Military\ncontracts.\nBrands and Product Lines\nOur products are marketed under eight well-recognized, proprietary brands: Rocky, Muck, Georgia Boot, Durango, XTRATUF,\nLehigh and Ranger, in addition to the licensed brand Michelin.\nRocky\nRocky, established in 1979, is our premium priced line of branded footwear, apparel and accessories.

In 2002, we also extended into hunting apparel, including jackets, pants, gloves and caps. Our Rocky\nproducts for hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts are designed for specific weather conditions and the diverse terrains of North\nAmerica. These products incorporate a range of technical features and designs such waterproof breathable fabric, 3M Thinsulate\ninsulation, nylon Cordura fabric and camouflaged uppers featuring either Venator, Mossy Oak or Realtree patterns. We use\nrugged outsoles made by industry leaders like Vibram, as well as our own proprietary design features, to make the products\ndurable and easy to wear.\nWe also produce Rocky duty and commercial military, public service footwear targeting law enforcement professionals, military,\nsecurity workers, fire industry professionals and postal service employees, and we have established leading market share\npositions in these categories.\nIn 2002, we introduced Rocky work footwear designed for varying weather conditions or difficult terrain, particularly for people\nwho make their living outdoors such as those in lumber, forestry, and oil & gas occupations. These products typically include\nmany of the proprietary features and technologies that we incorporate in our hunting and outdoor products.\nWe have also introduced western influenced work boots for farmers and ranchers. Most of these products are waterproof,\ninsulated and utilize our proprietary comfort systems.\nMuck\nMuck was founded in 1999 and has pioneered the premium rubber and neoprene boot category by delivering high quality,\ninnovative, weatherproof and comfortable products. Our current line of Muck footwear products is offered at suggested U.S.\nretail price points ranging from $55.00 to $265.00. Through widespread consumer validation in the farm, agriculture, hunt and\nequestrian segments, Muck has been able to expand to new segments such as outdoor, gardening, industrial and general work, as\nwell as to new international regions such as the U.K., Norway and Germany to reach new consumers who have adopted the brand\nand its offerings. Both new and existing consumer groups have welcomed line extensions from the brand as the total catalog\nexpands beyond its core offering into premium leather and other new footwear categories.\nGeorgia Boot\nGeorgia Boot was launched in 1937 and is our moderately priced, high quality line of work and rugged lifestyle footwear. Georgia\nBoot footwear is sold at suggested U.S. retail price points ranging from $76.00 to $292.00. This line of products primarily targets\nblue collar workers across various trades, including construction, logging, warehousing, landscaping and farming. Many of our\nboots incorporate safety toes and non-slip outsoles to prevent injuries in the workplace. We also offer other more specialized\nprotective features, such as puncture resistance, as well as metatarsal guards that protect wearers’ feet from heavy objects. Each\nboot is designed to meet the demands of specific trades while also integrating cutting-edge technology and materials to create\nthe most comfortable and durable footwear that is tough enough to handle the rigors found on job sites across America.\nDurango\nDurango Boots was established in 1966 and manufactures premium western footwear for men, women and kids. Over the last 50\nyears, Durango has earned a reputation for building authentic western boots using exceptional materials and innovative\nconstructions. Our current line of Durango products is offered at suggested U.S. retail price points ranging from\n$120.00 to $655.00. Our brand portfolio categories include work-western, farm and ranch, western-performance, premium\nexotics, fashion-forward and casual wear.\nMany of our western products are marketed to core western and aspirational western consumers who have an affinity and loyalty\nto the western lifestyle. Such products include high-performance technologies that include our patented Dually Shank\nSystem which provides twice the torsion stability and midfoot support and various footbeds that offer flexibility, comfort and\nsupport for immediate gratification.\nXTRATUF\nSince the early 1950s, XTRATUF has been a leading outfitter in the commercial, sport, and recreational fishing segment, having\nprovided fishermen with capable, comfortable and reliable footwear for use in the harshest conditions. With roots in Alaska and\ncontinued widespread use by those who live there, the XTRATUF brand has been able to expand to other regions throughout\nNorth America and most recently in the U.K. and Japan. Fueled by the strong growth in the outdoor segment; particularly white\nboat lifestyle and sport fishing, the brand has been adopted by non-fishermen seeking quality, functional footwear. Our current\nline of XTRATUF footwear products is offered at suggested U.S. retail price points ranging from $45.00 to $195.00.\n4\nLehigh\nThe Lehigh brand was established in 1922 as a high-quality line of occupational safety footwear that later expanded into a full-\nservice program offering. While still manufacturing and selling branded core product, the brand primarily focuses on providing\nmanaged programs to corporations that require and provide a subsidy to their employees to wear safety footwear. Most of the\nfootwear incorporates a protective toe and can include a metatarsal guard, puncture-resistant, slip-resistant outsole and special\nmaterials to combat caustic substances. Lehigh offers an extensive selection of styles to fit any work environment. Lehigh’s\nunique business model provides companies with customizations to fit their needs and digital tools for greater visibility and control\nof their program. As the established leader in the industry, Lehigh introduced and utilizes 3DFit technology and wellness foot\nproducts as a way to elevate safety and improve productivity. By providing an accurate fit, body aligning orthotics and anti-\nfatigue compression, Lehigh helps companies go beyond accident protection to full body wellness protection. Lehigh provides\nand improves safety and health to a wide range of customer accounts in the industrial, distribution, hospitality and healthcare\nindustries.\nThe Lehigh brand line of safety shoes has suggested U.S. retail price points ranging from $91.00 to $274.00.\nRanger\nRanger primarily serves the outdoor recreational market and offers a range of pac-boots that are built for wet and cold weather\nthat provide exceptional comfort and function at a value price. Our current line of Ranger footwear products is offered at\nsuggested U.S. retail price points ranging from $74.00 to $100.00.\nMichelin\nMichelin is a premier price point line of work footwear targeting specific industrial professions, primarily indoor professions.\nThe license to design, develop and manufacture footwear under the Michelin name was secured in 2006. Suggested U.S. retail\nprices for the Michelin brand are from $157.00 to $237.00. The license agreement for the Michelin brand expires on December\n31, 2025, with the option to renew.\nProduct Lines\nOur brands are organized into six distinct product lines, which consist of high-quality products that target the following markets:\n● Outdoor.

We believe that our long history of designing, manufacturing and marketing premium\nquality, branded footwear has enabled us to develop strong relationships with our retailers in each of our distribution\nchannels. We reinforce these relationships by continuing to offer innovative footwear products, by continuing to meet\nthe individual needs of each of our retailers and by working with our retailers to improve the visual merchandising of\nour products in their stores. We believe that strengthening our relationships with retailers will allow us to increase our\npresence through additional store locations and expanded shelf space, improve our market position in a consolidating\nretail environment and enable us to better understand and meet the evolving needs of both our retailers and consumers.\n● Diverse product sourcing and manufacturing capabilities. We believe our strategy of utilizing both company operated\nand third-party facilities for the sourcing of our products offers several advantages. Operating our own facilities\nsignificantly improves our knowledge of the entire production process, which allows us to more efficiently source\nproduct from third parties that is of the highest quality and at the lowest cost available. We intend to continue to source\na higher proportion of our products from third-party manufacturers, which we believe will enable us to obtain high\nquality products at lower costs per unit.\nGrowth Strategy\nWe intend to increase our sales through the following strategies:\n● Expand into new target markets under existing brands. We believe there is significant opportunity to extend certain of\nour brands into our other target markets. We intend to continue to introduce products across varying feature sets and\nprice points in order to meet the needs of our customers.\n● Cross-sell our brands to our retailers. We believe that many retailers of our brands target consumers with similar\ncharacteristics and, as a result, we believe there is significant opportunity to offer each of our retailers a broader\nassortment of footwear and apparel that target multiple markets and span a range of feature sets and price points.\n● Expand business internationally. We intend to extend certain of our brands into international markets. We believe this\nis a significant opportunity because of the long history and authentic heritage of these brands. We intend to grow our\nbusiness internationally through a network of distributors.\n6\n● Grow our e-commerce business. We intend to drive business to our branded e-commerce websites as well as third-party\nmarketplace platforms. We believe there is an opportunity to capitalize on the changes in the market to online shopping\nas we focus advertising efforts and maximize our distribution capabilities.\n● Increases in our Lehigh business. We believe that our business-to-business CustomFit platform has ample opportunity\nto grow as we continue to pursue large manufacturers, distributors, and other companies who are reliant on safety\nfootwear programs. We feel that diversifying our product lines and continuing to provide an easy, no hassle approach\nto purchasing will allow us to expand within the market.\n● Acquire or develop new brands. We intend to continue to acquire or develop new brands that are complementary to our\nportfolio and could leverage our operational infrastructure and distribution network.\nMarketing and Advertising\nWe believe that our brands have a reputation for high quality, comfort, functionality and durability built through their long history\nin the markets they serve. To further increase the strength and awareness of our brands, we have developed comprehensive\nmarketing and advertising programs to gain national exposure and expand brand awareness for each of our brands in their target\nmarkets.\nWe have focused the majority of our advertising efforts on both digital advertising and consumer advertising in support of our\nretail partners. Digital advertising includes online brand level marketing, search engine pay-per-click, retargeting and social\nmedia targeting. A key component to supporting our retail partners includes in-store point of purchase materials that add a\ndramatic focus to our brands and the products our retail partners carry. We also advertise through targeted national and local\ncable programs, radio advertisements and print publications aimed at audiences that share the demographic profile of our typical\ncustomers. In addition, we promote through event sponsorships which provide significant national exposure for all of our brands\nas well as a direct connection to our target consumer. Our print advertisements and television commercials emphasize the\ntechnical features of our products as well as their high quality, comfort, functionality and durability.\nWe also support independent dealers by listing their locations in our national print advertisements. In addition to our national\nadvertising campaigns, we have developed attractive merchandising displays and store-in-store concept fixturing that are\navailable to our retailers who purchase the breadth of our product lines. We also attend numerous tradeshows which allow us to\nshowcase our entire product line to retail buyers and have historically been an important source of new accounts.\nProduct Design and Development\nWe believe that product innovation is a key competitive advantage for us in each of our markets. Our goal in product design and\ndevelopment is to continue to create and introduce new and innovative footwear and apparel products that combine our standards\nof quality, functionality and comfort and that meet the changing needs of our retailers and consumers. Our product design and\ndevelopment process is highly collaborative and is typically initiated both internally by our development staff and externally by\nour retailers and suppliers, whose employees are generally active users of our products and understand the needs of our\nconsumers. Our product design and development personnel, marketing personnel and sales representatives work closely together\nto identify opportunities for new styles, patterns, design improvements and newer, more advanced materials. We have a dedicated\ngroup of product design and development professionals, some of whom are well recognized experts in the footwear and apparel\nindustries, who continually interact with consumers to better understand their needs and are committed to ensuring our products\nreflect the most advanced designs, features and materials available in the marketplace.\nManufacturing and Sourcing\nWe manufacture footwear in facilities that we own and operate in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Chuzhou, China and\nsource footwear, apparel and accessories from third-party facilities in China, Vietnam, India, Dominican Republic and Mexico.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with any of our third-party manufacturers. We believe that operating our own facilities\nsignificantly improves our knowledge of the entire raw material sourcing and manufacturing process, which enables us to more\nefficiently source finished goods from third parties that are of the highest quality and at the lowest cost available, as well as\nreduce our lead times. In addition, our Puerto Rico facility allows us to produce footwear for the U.S. Military and other\ncommercial businesses that require production by a U.S. manufacturer. Sourcing products from offshore third-party facilities\ngenerally enables us to lower our costs per unit while maintaining high product quality and limits the capital investment required\nto establish and maintain company operated manufacturing facilities. Because quality is an important part of our value proposition\nto our retailers and consumers, we source products from manufacturers who have demonstrated the intent and ability to maintain\nthe high quality that has become associated with our brands.\n7\nQuality control is stressed at every stage of the manufacturing process and is monitored by trained quality assurance personnel\nat each of our manufacturing facilities, including our third-party factories. In addition, we utilize a team of procurement, quality\ncontrol and logistics employees in our China office and a third-party quality control service provider to visit factories to conduct\nquality control reviews of raw materials, work in process inventory and finished goods. We also utilize quality control personnel\nat our finished goods distribution facilities to conduct quality control testing on incoming sourced finished goods and raw\nmaterials and inspect random samples from our finished goods inventory from each of our manufacturing facilities to ensure that\nall items meet our high-quality standards.\nForeign Operations and Sales Outside of the U.S.\nOur products are primarily distributed in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and other international markets, mainly in Europe. We ship our\nproducts from our finished goods distribution facilities located in Ohio and Nevada. Certain of our retailers receive shipments\ndirectly from our manufacturing sources, including all of our U.S. Military sales, which are shipped directly from our\nmanufacturing facility in Puerto Rico. Net sales to foreign countries represented approximately 5.1% of net sales in 2023\nand 6.2% of net sales in 2022.\nAs previously mentioned, we maintain manufacturing facilities that we operate in the Dominican Republic and Chuzhou, China.\nIn addition, we utilize an office in China to support our contract manufacturers.\nThe net book value of fixed assets located outside of the U.S. totaled $11.9 million at December 31, 2023, of which\napproximately $3.9 million resides in the Dominican Republic and approximately $8.0 million resides in China.\nResources and Suppliers\nWe purchase raw materials from sources worldwide. We do not have any long-term supply contracts for the purchase of our raw\nmaterials, except for limited blanket purchase orders on leather to protect wholesale selling prices for an extended period of time.\nThe principal raw materials used in the production of our products, in terms of dollar value, are leather, Gore-Tex waterproof\nbreathable fabric, Cordura nylon fabric and soling materials. We believe these materials will continue to be available from our\ncurrent suppliers. However, in the event these materials are not available from our current suppliers, we believe these products,\nor similar products, would be available from alternative sources.\nSeasonality and Weather\nHistorically, we have experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our business as many of our footwear products are used by\nconsumers in adverse weather conditions. In order to meet these demands, we must manufacture and source footwear year-round\nto be in a position to ship advance and at-once orders for these products during the last two quarters of each year. Accordingly,\naverage inventory levels have been highest during the second and third quarters of each year and sales have been highest in the\nlast two quarters of the year. In addition, mild or dry weather conditions historically have had a material adverse effect on sales\nof our outdoor products, particularly if they occurred in broad geographical areas during late fall or early winter.\nBacklog\nThe dollar amount of our order backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and, accordingly, is not\nmaterial to an understanding of the business taken as a whole.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of our trademarks, patents, trade dress, and other intellectual property rights, as well as contractual\nprovisions to protect our brands, product designs, technology, marketing materials, and other proprietary research and\ndevelopment, although no such methods can afford complete protection. We own numerous design and utility patents for\nfootwear and footwear components (such as insoles and outsoles) in the U.S. and in several countries where our products are\nsold or manufactured, including China. We own numerous U.S. and foreign registrations for the patents and trademarks used in\nour business, including our major brands Rocky, Muck, Georgia Boot, Durango, XTRATUF, Lehigh, and Ranger. In addition,\nwe license the use of third-party trademarks, including Gore-Tex and Michelin, in order to market our products.\nOur license with W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (\"Gore\") permits us to use the Gore-Tex and related marks on products and styles\nthat have been approved in advance by Gore. The license agreement has a one-year term that automatically renews each year,\nunless either party elects to terminate by giving advance written notice to the other party by October 1 for termination effective\nDecember 31 of that same year.\n8\nSimilarly, our license with Michelin Lifestyle Limited permits us to use the Michelin brand and related marks on our products.\nOur license agreement with Michelin Lifestyle Limited to use the Michelin name expires on December 31, 2025, with the option\nto renew.\nIn the U.S. and China, our design patents are generally in effect for 15 years from the date of issuance. Our utility patents are\ngenerally in effect for 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application. Our trademarks are generally valid as long as\nthey are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.\nWhile we have an active program to protect our intellectual property by filing for patents and trademark registrations, we do not\nbelieve that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual patent or trademark. We are not aware of any material\ninfringement of our intellectual property rights or that we are infringing any intellectual property rights owned by third parties.\nMoreover, we are not aware of any material conflicts concerning our trademarks or those owned by others. We actively enforce\nour trademarks and patents, and pursue those who infringe upon them, whether domestically or internationally, as we deem\nappropriate.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a very competitive environment. Product function, design, comfort, quality, technological and material\nimprovements, brand awareness, timeliness of product delivery and pricing are all important elements of competition in the\nmarkets for our products. We believe that the strength of our brands, the quality of our products and our long-term relationships\nwith a broad range of retailers allow us to compete effectively in the footwear and apparel markets that we serve. However, we\ncompete with footwear and apparel companies that have greater financial, marketing, distribution and manufacturing resources\nthan we do. In addition, many of these competitors have strong brand name recognition in the markets they serve.\nThe footwear and apparel industry is also subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences. Some of our product lines are\nsusceptible to changes in both technical innovation and fashion trends. Therefore, the success of these products and styles are\nmore dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing product, material and design innovations, as well as fashion\ntrends and consumer demands in a timely manner. Our inability or failure to do so could adversely affect consumer acceptance\nof these product lines and styles and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nHuman Capital\nAt December 31, 2023, we had approximately 2,100 employees of which approximately 2,060 are full time employees.\nApproximately 1,600 of our employees work in our manufacturing facilities in the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and\nChuzhou, China. We believe our relations with our employees are in good standing.\nEmployee Well Being\nFounded from the humble beginnings of a small, family owned business, our employees have always been the key to making our\nCompany successful. As such, we believe that fostering an environment that advocates for all areas of employee health (including\nphysical, mental and emotional) is crucial. We offer a tuition assistance reimbursement program and an employee assistance\nprogram, which can assist employees in various aspects of their personal life and overall well-being. We also encourage our\nemployees to take continuing education classes that will aid in their day-to-day work responsibilities and we promote a healthy\nlifestyle through monthly newsletters and various health focused events throughout the year.\nThe health and safety of our employees is one of our highest priorities. Our Health and Wellness Committee strives to educate\nour employees on the importance of taking care of yourself both inside and outside the workplace. Throughout the year we\ncontract with various health and wellness professionals outside of our organization to hold educational sessions for our employees\nboth in-person and virtually. Nothing is more fundamental than providing our employees with an environment where they feel\nsafe, secure and supported.\n9\nTalent Recruitment, Retention and Development\nOur employee culture is built on our core values of integrity, responsibility and humility. The ability to attract, retain and develop\ntalented employees is crucial to our long-term success. We focus on attracting, developing and retaining highly talented\nindividuals through practices that promote inclusion, diversity and equality. We recruit through a variety of outreach methods\nincluding our rockybrands.com/careers website and other online platforms, such as LinkedIn, college recruitment efforts,\nnetwork relationships and direct communication with career centers. When new employment opportunities within our Company\narise, we send out internal communications to inform all associates of new openings. We review internal applications for\nconsideration before considering external applicants.\nWe strive to maximize engagement with our employees in a variety of ways, including scheduled meetings between employees\nand executive leadership within the first few months of employment, face-to-face and virtual interviews with employees\nfollowing 60 days and one year of employment, annual performance evaluations, regular check-in surveys and exit surveys. We\nalso rely on our management team to influence growth and develop a path for success with employees on each team within our\norganization. Quarterly, our CEO and COO hold all-employee communication meetings to keep our employees apprised of recent\nhappenings within our organization and to allow employees a forum for their voice to be heard.\nWe are committed to having a diverse and inclusive workforce which is reflected in a wide range of cultures, religions, ethnicities\nand nationalities as well as varied professional and educational backgrounds. We believe that the inclusion of diverse perspectives\nresults in better outcomes and policies. We aim to foster an inclusive workplace through recruitment and development efforts,\nand through the retention of diverse talent with a goal of expanding representation across all dimensions of equality and inclusion.\nWe strive to provide an environment that allows our employees to bring their authentic selves to work every day, and we are\ncommitted to fostering a workplace that is free of discrimination, harassment, and which promotes allyship, advocacy and an\noverall sense of belonging.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur compensation structure is set up to reward employees for performance. We regularly evaluate employee compensation to\nensure it is competitive and in-line with market benchmarks and to reward employees who perform at a high level. We offer\ncomprehensive benefit programs to our employees including medical, dental and vision. We also provide a 401(k) match and\nsafe harbor contribution, paid time off, including maternal and paternal leave, life insurance and long-term and short-term\ndisability.\nAvailable Information\nAs required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), we file annual, quarterly and current\nreports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The SEC maintains a\nwebsite that contains information about issuers, like us, who file electronic reports with the SEC. The address of the SEC’s\nwebsite is www.sec.gov. In addition, we make available free of charge on our corporate website, www.rockybrands.com, our\nannual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and, if applicable, amendments to\nthose reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after\nsuch reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Except as specifically incorporated by reference into this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K, information on those websites is not part of this report.\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to certain risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision,\ninvestors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included\nor incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of\noperations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. These described risks are not the only\nrisks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely\naffect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If any of these risks were to materialize, the value\nof our common stock could decline significantly.\n10\nBusiness Risks\nExpanding our brands into new footwear and apparel markets may be difficult and expensive, and if we are unable to\nsuccessfully continue such expansion, our brands may be adversely affected, and we may not achieve our planned sales\ngrowth.\nOur growth strategy is founded substantially on the expansion of our brands into new footwear and apparel markets. New\nproducts that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or one or more of our brands may fall out of favor with\nconsumers. If we are unable to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, we may not grow\nas fast as we plan to grow or our sales may decline, and our brand image and operating performance may suffer.\nFurthermore, achieving market acceptance for new products will likely require us to exert substantial product development and\nmarketing efforts, which could result in a material increase in our operating expenses, and there can be no assurance that we will\nhave the resources necessary to undertake such efforts. Material increases in our operating expenses could adversely impact our\nresults of operations and cash flows.\nWe may also encounter difficulties in producing new products that we did not anticipate during the development stage. Our\ndevelopment schedules for new products are difficult to predict and are subject to change as a result of shifting priorities in\nresponse to consumer preferences and competing products. If we are not able to efficiently manufacture newly-developed\nproducts in quantities sufficient to support retail distribution, we may not be able to recoup our investment in the development\nof new products. Failure to gain market acceptance for new products that we introduce could impede our growth, reduce our\nprofits, adversely affect the image of our brands, erode our competitive position and result in long term harm to our business.\nA majority of our products are produced outside the U.S. where we are subject to the risks of international commerce and\nother international conditions.\nA majority of our products are produced in China, the Dominican Republic, and Vietnam. Therefore, our business is subject to\ncertain risks of doing business offshore including:\n● the imposition of additional U.S. legislation and regulations relating to imports, including quotas, duties, taxes or other\ncharges or restrictions;\n● foreign governmental regulation and taxation, including tariffs, import and export controls and other non-tariff barriers;\n● fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;\n● changes in economic conditions, including expropriation and nationalization;\n● transportation conditions and costs in the Pacific and Caribbean;\n● changes in the political stability of these countries;\n● labor disputes and other work stoppages or interruptions;\n● changes in relationships between the U.S. and these countries; and\n● the occurrence of contagious disease or illness.\nChanges in any of these factors could materially increase our costs of products or cause us to experience delays and we may not\nbe able to recover all of our cost increases or missed sales. If any of these factors were to render the conduct of business in these\ncountries undesirable or impracticable, we would have to manufacture or source our products elsewhere. There can be no\nassurance that additional sources or products would be available to us or, if available, that these sources could be relied on to\nprovide product at terms favorable to us. The occurrence of any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n11\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate consumer trends.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by changing consumer trends. Our future success will depend upon our\nability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and technical design or material developments in a timely\nmanner. The failure to adequately anticipate or respond to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for key production materials, and any disruption in the supply of such materials\ncould interrupt product manufacturing and increase product costs.\nWe purchase raw materials from a number of domestic and foreign sources. We do not have any long-term supply contracts for\nthe purchase of our raw materials, except for limited blanket orders on leather. The principal raw materials used in the production\nof our footwear, in terms of dollar value, are leather, Gore-Tex waterproof breathable fabric, Cordura nylon fabric and soling\nmaterials. Availability or change in the prices of our raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that\notherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as fluctuations in freight costs, port and shipping capacity, labor\ndisputes or severe weather due to climate change. These issues have in the past and may in the future delay importation of\nproducts or require us to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives\nmay not be available on short notice or could result in higher costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business and\nfinancial condition.\nThe emergence or persistence of geopolitical instability may disrupt the global economy, the impacts of which may negatively\nimpact our business, financial, condition and results of operations.\nThe emergence or persistence of geopolitical instability creates risks for disruptions in the global economy which may negatively\nimpact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Factors such as shipping disruptions in the Red Sea,\nuncertainties related to the political environment in China, and ongoing conflicts such as the war between Russia and\nUkraine have adversely affected the global economy and contributed to geopolitical instability. While we have managed to\nnavigate impacts from these conflicts thus far, the ongoing instability resulting from these disruptions or other future\ndisruptions could potentially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, supply chain, intangible assets,\npartners, customers, or employees, should tensions escalate. Moreover, an escalation of geopolitical tensions may lead to broader\nimpacts, including but not limited to cyberattacks, supply chain and logistics disruptions, lower consumer demand, and changes\nto foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Any of these factors may adversely affect our business and supply chain.\nOur outdoor and insulated products are seasonal and sales of such products are sensitive to weather conditions.\nWe have historically experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in our business because we derive a significant portion of our\nrevenues from sales of our outdoor products. Many of our outdoor products are used by consumers in cold or wet weather. As a\nresult, a majority of orders for these products are placed by our retailers in January through April for delivery in July through\nOctober. In order to meet demand, we must manufacture and source outdoor footwear year-round to be in a position to ship\nadvance orders for these products during the last two quarters of each year. Accordingly, average inventory levels have been\nhighest during the second and third quarters of each year and sales have been highest in the last two quarters of each year. There\nis no assurance that we will have either sufficient inventory to satisfy demand in any particular quarter or have sufficient demand\nto sell substantially all of our inventory without significant markdowns. Mild or dry weather has in the past and may in the future\nhave a material adverse effect on sales of our products, particularly if mild or dry weather conditions occur in broad geographical\nareas during late fall or early winter. Climate change may exacerbate these conditions.\nOur business could suffer if our third-party manufacturers violate labor, environmental or other applicable laws or fail to\nconform to generally accepted ethical standards.\nWe require our third-party manufacturers to meet our standards for working conditions and other matters before we are willing\nto place business with them. As a result, we may not always obtain the lowest cost production. Moreover, we do not control our\nthird-party manufacturers or their respective business practices. If one of our third-party manufacturers violates generally\naccepted labor standards by, for example, using forced or indentured labor or child labor, failing to pay compensation in\naccordance with local law, failing to operate its factories in compliance with local safety regulations or diverging from other\nlabor practices generally accepted as ethical, we likely would cease dealing with that manufacturer, and we could suffer an\ninterruption in our product supply. Similarly, if one or more of our third-party manufacturers violate applicable environmental\nor other laws and regulations, we could suffer an interruption in our product supply. In addition, such actions by a manufacturer\n12\ncould result in negative publicity and may damage our reputation and the value of our brand and discourage retail customers and\nconsumers from buying our products.\nThe growth of our business will be dependent upon the availability of adequate capital.\nThe growth of our business will depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn will depend largely on cash flow\ngenerated by our business and the availability of equity and debt financing. We cannot assure that our operations will generate\npositive cash flow or that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all. Our credit\nfacilities contain provisions that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make substantial asset sales that might\notherwise be used to finance our expansion. Security interests in substantially all of our assets, which may further limit our access\nto certain capital markets or lending sources, secure our obligations under our credit facilities. Moreover, the actual availability\nof funds under our credit facilities is limited to specified percentages of our eligible inventory and accounts receivable.\nAccordingly, opportunities for increasing our cash on hand through sales of inventory would be partially offset by reduced\navailability under our credit facilities. As a result, we may not be able to finance our current expansion plans.\nOur current level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business by increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our\noverall business flexibility.\nOur current level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business by increasing our borrowing costs and decreasing our\noverall business flexibility. We have debt outstanding under two credit facilities, which contain customary restrictive covenants\nimposing operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in certain actions that\nmay be in our long-term best interests.\nWe must comply with the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities.\nOur credit facilities require us to comply with certain financial restrictive covenants that impose restrictions on our operations,\nincluding our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments of other restricted payments, sell or otherwise dispose\nof assets and engage in other activities. Any failure by us to comply with the restrictive covenants could result in an event of\ndefault under those borrowing arrangements, in which case the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder\nto be due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our credit facilities contain\nrestrictive covenants which requires us to maintain a maximum total average ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio.\nInterest rate increases could adversely affect our financial results.\nAn increase in interest rates under our credit facilities would adversely affect our financial results, as our loan agreements provide\nfor adjustments in our interest rates based on changes to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and/or the prime rate.\nWe face intense competition, including competition from companies with significantly greater resources than ours, and if we\nare unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nThe footwear and apparel industries are intensely competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. A number of\nour competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution\nresources than we do, as well as greater brand awareness in the footwear market. Our ability to succeed depends on our ability\nto remain competitive with respect to the quality, design, price and timely delivery of products. Competition could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial success is influenced by the success of our customers, and the loss of a key customer could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMuch of our financial success is directly related to the ability of our retailer and distributor partners to successfully market and\nsell our brands directly to consumers. If a retailer or distributor partner fails to satisfy contractual obligations or to otherwise\nmeet our expectations, it may be difficult to locate an acceptable substitute partner. If we determine that it is necessary to make\na change, we may experience increased costs, loss of customers, or increased credit or inventory risk. In addition, there is no\nguarantee that any replacement retailer or distributor partner will generate results that are more favorable than the terminated\nparty. We currently do not have long-term contracts with any of our retailers. Sales to our retailers and distributors are generally\non an order-by-order basis and are subject to rights of cancellation and rescheduling by our wholesale customers. We use the\ntiming of delivery dates for our wholesale customer orders as a key factor in forecasting our sales and earnings for future periods.\nIf any of our major customers experience a significant downturn in business or fail to remain committed to our products or brands,\nthese customers could postpone, reduce, or discontinue purchases from us, which could result in us failing to meet our forecasted\nresults. These risks have been exacerbated recently as our key retail customers are operating within a retail industry that continues\n13\nto undergo significant structural changes fueled by technology and the internet, changes in consumer purchasing behavior and a\nshrinking retail footprint. We may lose key retail and wholesale customers if they fail to manage the impact of the rapidly\nchanging retail environment. Any loss of one of these key customers, the financial collapse or bankruptcy of one of these\ncustomers, or a significant reduction in purchases from one of these customers could result in a significant decline in sales, write-\ndowns of excess inventory, or increased discounts to our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our larger wholesale customers may develop and manufacture competing products under their own brands and\nreduce purchases of our branded products.\nCertain of our larger wholesale customers may develop, and in certain cases have developed, products under their own brands\nthat compete with our branded products. Wholesale customers who increase the concentration of their own brands may result in\na reduction or elimination of purchases of our branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe currently manufacture a portion of our products, and we may not be able to do so in the future, at costs that are competitive\nwith those of competitors who source their goods.\nWe currently plan to retain our internal manufacturing capability in order to continue benefiting from expertise we have gained\nwith respect to footwear manufacturing methods conducted at our manufacturing facilities. We continue to evaluate our\nmanufacturing facilities and third-party manufacturing alternatives in order to determine the appropriate size and scope of our\nmanufacturing facilities. There can be no assurance that the costs of products that continue to be manufactured by us can remain\ncompetitive with products sourced from third parties.\nWe rely on our distribution centers in Ohio and Nevada and manufacturing facilities in the Dominican Republic, Puerto\nRico, and China and if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities, we may be unable to\ndeliver merchandise effectively to our retailers and consumers.\nWe rely on our distribution centers located in Ohio and Nevada and our manufacturing facilities in the Dominican Republic,\nPuerto Rico, and China. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities due to fire, tornado, flood,\nterrorist attack or any other cause could damage our ability to manufacture our products, a portion of our inventory, or impair\nour ability to use our distribution center as a docking location for merchandise. Any of these occurrences could impair our ability\nto adequately supply our retailers and consumers and harm our operating results.\nIf our efforts to establish and protect our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property are unsuccessful, the value of\nour brands could suffer.\nWe regard certain of our footwear designs as proprietary and rely on patents to protect those designs. We believe that the\nownership of patents is a significant factor in our business. Existing intellectual property laws afford only limited protection of\nour proprietary rights, and it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain of our footwear designs or to reverse\nengineer or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. If our patents are found to be invalid, however,\nto the extent they have served, or would in the future serve, as a barrier to entry to our competitors, such invalidity could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe own U.S. registrations for many our trademarks, trade names and designs, including such marks as Rocky, Muck, Georgia\nBoot, Durango, XTRATUF, Lehigh and Ranger. Additional trademarks, trade names and designs are the subject of pending\nfederal applications for registration. We also use and have common law rights in certain trademarks. Over time, we have increased\ndistribution of our goods in several foreign countries. Accordingly, we have applied for trademark registrations in a number of\nthese countries. We intend to enforce our trademarks and trade names against unauthorized use by third parties.\nAn impairment of intangibles, including goodwill, could have an adverse impact to the Company’s results of operations.\nThe carrying value of intangibles represents the fair value of trade names and other acquired intangibles as of the acquisition\ndate. Acquired intangibles expected to contribute indefinitely to the Company’s cash flows are not amortized but must be\nevaluated by the Company at least annually for impairment. If the carrying amounts of one or more of these assets are not\nrecoverable based upon discounted cash flow and market-approach analyses, the carrying amounts of such assets are impaired\nby the estimated difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value. An impairment charge could adversely affect\nthe Company’s results of operations.\n14\nOur success depends on our ability to forecast sales.\nOur investments in infrastructure and product inventory are based on sales forecasts and are necessarily made in advance of\nactual sales. The markets in which we do business are highly competitive, and our business is affected by a variety of factors,\nincluding brand awareness, changing consumer preferences, product innovations, susceptibility to fashion trends, retail market\nconditions, weather conditions and economic conditions, and other factors. One of our principal challenges is to improve our\nability to predict these factors in order to enable us to better match production with demand. In addition, our growth over the\nyears has created the need to increase the investment in infrastructure and product inventory and to enhance our systems. To the\nextent sales forecasts are not achieved, costs associated with the infrastructure and carrying costs of product inventory would\nrepresent a higher percentage of revenue, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations\nand cash flows.\nOur dividend policy may change.\nAlthough we have paid dividends to our shareholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may change our dividend\npolicy at any time without notice to our shareholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash\ndividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.\nIndustry Risks\nBecause the footwear market is sensitive to decreased consumer spending and slow economic cycles, if general economic\nconditions deteriorate, many of our customers may significantly reduce their purchases from us or may not be able to pay for\nour products in a timely manner.\nThe footwear industry has been subject to cyclical variation and decline in performance when consumer spending decreases or\nsoftness appears in the retail market. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the footwear industry, including:\n● general business conditions;\n● interest rates;\n● the availability of consumer credit;\n● weather;\n● increases in prices of nondiscretionary goods;\n● taxation; and\n● consumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, may decline during recessionary periods and also may\ndecline at other times when disposable income is lower. A downturn in regional economies where we sell products also reduces\nsales.\nThe continued shift in the marketplace from traditional independent retailers to large mass merchandisers may result in\ndecreased margins.\nA continued shift in the marketplace from traditional independent retailers to large mass merchandisers has increased the pressure\non many footwear manufacturers to sell products to these mass merchandisers at less favorable margins. Because of competition\nfrom large discount mass merchandisers, a number of our small retailing customers have gone out of business, and in the future\nmore of these customers may go out of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations and cash flows.\n15\nIf we do not effectively respond to the shift of consumer shopping moving to online retailers, including third-party\nmarketplaces, it may negatively impact our business.\nThe retail industry is rapidly changing and we must ensure we are evolving both our own online e-commerce websites and third-\nparty marketplaces. We must also provide digital assistance to our wholesale customers to support their e-commerce websites.\nFailure to timely identify and effectively respond to the online trends of the retail industry could negatively impact our product\nreach and market share. We are making technology investments in our websites and mobile applications. If we are unable to\nimprove or develop relevant technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges to U.S. tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions,\nfinancial markets and our business.\nThe current political climate has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations\naffecting trade between the U.S. and other countries. We source products from manufacturers located outside of the U.S.,\nprimarily in China and Vietnam. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions\nfor imported products or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products, could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations and liquidity.\nThere are risks, including stock market volatility, inherent in owning our common stock.\nThe market price and volume of our common stock have been, and may continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations. These\nfluctuations may arise from general stock market conditions, the impact of risk factors described in this Item 1A on our results\nof operations and financial position, or a change in opinion in the market regarding our business prospects or other factors, many\nof which may be outside our immediate control. Changes in the amounts and frequency of share repurchases or dividends also\ncould adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nDisruption of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business\nOur information technology systems are critical to our business operations. Any interruption, unauthorized access, impairment\nor loss of data integrity or malfunction of these systems could severely impact our business, including delays in product\nfulfillment and reduced efficiency in operations. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the\nimplementation of new or upgraded systems, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems, could disrupt or\nreduce the efficiency of our operations. Disruption to our information technology systems may be caused by natural disasters,\naccidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses,\nphysical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions could prevent access to our\nonline services and preclude retail transactions. System failures and disruptions could also impede the manufacturing and\nshipping of products, transactions processing and financial reporting. Additionally, we may be adversely affected if we are unable\nto improve, upgrade, maintain, and expand our technology systems.\nSome of our employees are working remotely which could strain our information technology systems and impact business\ncontinuity plans. Remote work could also introduce operational risk such as, but not limited to, cyber security risks.\nA cyber-security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe rely heavily on digital technologies for the successful operation of our business, including electronic messaging, digital\nmarketing efforts and the collection and retention of customer data and employee information. We also rely on third parties to\nprocess credit card transactions, perform online e-commerce and social media activities and retain data relating to our financial\nposition and results of operations, strategic initiatives and other important information. Despite the security measures we have in\nplace, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches,\nacts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any\nmisappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, whether by us or\nby our third-party service providers, could damage our reputation and our customers’ willingness to purchase our products, which\nmay adversely affect our business. In addition, we could incur liabilities and remediation costs, including regulatory fines,\nreimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and costs for providing credit monitoring or other\nbenefits to customers or employees affected. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover\nall of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\n16\nCompliance with data privacy and marketing laws may subject us to increased additional costs, and our ability to effectively\nengage customers via personalized marketing may be impacted, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness operations.\nAs data privacy and marketing laws change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance. If applicable data\nprivacy and marketing laws become more restrictive at the federal or state level, our compliance costs may increase, our ability\nto effectively engage customers via personalized marketing may decrease, opportunities for growth may be curtailed by our\ncompliance capabilities or reputational harm and the potential liability for security breaches may increase. We are also subject\nto U.S. and international data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations, which may impose fines and penalties for\nnoncompliance and may have an adverse effect on our operations. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (the \"GDPR\"), which became effective in May 2018, extends the scope of the European Union’s data protection laws\nto all companies processing data of European Union residents, regardless of our location, and imposes significant new\nrequirements on how we collect, processes and transfer personal data.\nIn addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which became effective January 1, 2020 and\nlimits how we may collect and use personal data. Various other states have followed with similar laws governing the collection\nand use of personal data. As a result, GDPR, CCPA and other state law compliance increased our responsibility and potential\nliability in relation to personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure\ncompliance with the new data protection rules. Any failure to comply with these rules and related national laws of European\nUnion member states, could lead to government enforcement actions and significant penalties and fines against us, and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Continued compliance with the foregoing\nlaws and regulations, as well as any new laws or regulations that may be enacted in the future, can be costly.\nWe are subject to certain environmental and other regulations.\nSome of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international environmental and pollution\nlaws, including those relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal and labeling of, and human exposure to, hazardous and\ntoxic materials. Compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our\nfacilities or require us to acquire additional expensive equipment, modify our manufacturing processes or incur other significant\nexpenses. In addition, we could incur costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, or incur liability for third-party property damage\nor personal injury claims, or we could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs if we were to violate or\nbecome liable under any environmental laws. Liability under environmental laws can be joint and several and without regard to\ncomparative fault. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations have not occurred in the past\nand will not occur in the future as a result of our inability to obtain permits, human error, equipment failure or other causes, and\nany such violations could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany governmental and regulatory bodies globally are implementing regulations to address the impacts of climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations, whether mandated or voluntarily adopted by us, our suppliers, or third-party\nmanufacturers, may lead to heightened costs across various aspects of our operations. These increased costs may encompass\nenergy, production, transportation, raw materials, capital expenditures, as well as insurance premiums and deductibles. Such\nfinancial impacts have the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain\nan ongoing assessment and monitoring processes to gauge the impact that future climate change disclosures, regulations, or\nindustry standards, and international treaties may have on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings, which could result in the unexpected expenditure of\ntime and resources.\nWe are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business and to our past operations. Due\nto the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any\nsuch proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are expensive\nand will require that we devote substantial resources and executive time to defend, thereby diverting management’s attention and\nresources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nLoss of services of our key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nThe development of our business has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon execution at all levels of our organization\nwhich requires an experienced and talented executive team. The loss of service of any of the executive officers or key employees\ncould have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We have entered into employment agreements with several\nexecutive officers and key employees, and also offer compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent.\n17\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY.\nRisk Management & Strategy\nRocky Brands recognizes the critical importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining a robust information security\nprogram to safeguard our information systems and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. We have\nestablished information security programs and policies, including processes for identifying, assessing, and managing risks arising\nfrom cybersecurity threats. These processes involve regular assessments of our information systems and infrastructure to identify\nvulnerabilities and threats. We focus on executing a centralized information technology and cybersecurity program. Our\nCompany-wide approach is to be positioned as one security program, one posture and one roadmap for the enterprise. This\nplatform is administered across our departments by our cybersecurity team led by our Senior Vice President of Information\nTechnology. Our information security programs and policies are aligned with those of the Center for Internet Security (CIS),\nControl Objectives for Information Technologies (COBIT), and National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST).\nWe are integrating our information security programs and cybersecurity risk management processes into our overall enterprise\nrisk management (“ERM”) strategy. We are developing an entity-wide information technology ERM framework and will take\nsteps to monitor, report on and communicate to stakeholders consistent with our ERM strategy. Recognizing the cybersecurity\nrisk landscape is complex and ever evolving, we engage with a broad group of external experts and consultants, and auditors in\nevaluating and testing our information security programs. We leverage this specialized expertise to manage threat detection and\nresponse management, conduct regular audits and consult on our overall information security programs.\nWe are acutely aware of risks associated with third-party service providers and we incorporate cybersecurity into our third-party\nvendor management policy. We conduct thorough security assessment to determine the category of risk third parties pose to\nRocky Brands, with a priority focus on vendors with products or services that will have access to private and sensitive\ninformation. Vendor assessments incorporate inputs, including for example, BitSight and Service Organization Control Type 2\n(“SOC2”) information available for our third-party vendors. Our assessments and monitoring are designed to mitigate risks\nrelated to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third parties.\nAlthough no cybersecurity incidents during the year ended December 31, 2023 had a material impact on our business strategy,\nresults of operations or financial condition, the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. See Item 1A Risk\nFactors for more information about our information security and cybersecurity risks.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors has established governance protocol over risk management, including general oversight of information\ntechnology security and cybersecurity risk. The Audit Committee is central to the Board’s oversight of cybersecurity risks and\nis primarily responsible for this domain. The Audit Committee actively participates in discussions with management, external\nexperts, and amongst themselves regarding cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee is comprised of Board members with broad\nexpertise, including technology, risk management and finance, enabling them to effectively oversee and govern cybersecurity\nrisks. One Audit Committee member is certified under the National Association of Corporate Directors Certificate in Cyber-Risk\nOversight Program.\nWe have developed a robust organizational structure to manage and oversee our information technology and cybersecurity\nprograms, including full-time information security associates dedicated to cybersecurity. These individuals possess relevant\nexperience and expertise in cybersecurity and risk management. Our Senior Vice President of Information Technology leads our\ninformation security, data privacy and protection, and information technology compliance programs. Guided by management,\nour information technology teams maintain a detailed Cyber Incident Response Plan (“CIRP”) and hold frequent meetings\nto ensure the proper communication and execution of our security controls and procedures. The Senior Vice President of\nInformation Technology regularly reports to and maintains ongoing dialog with our CEO, CFO and COO, and Board of\nDirectors regarding our information security programs. This reporting includes updates on matters evaluated under our CIRP,\nthe current threat landscape, cybersecurity initiatives, and the effectiveness of our cybersecurity programs.\nOur Senior Vice President of Information Technology has more than 20 years of cybersecurity experience, is an active Certified\nInformation Systems Security Professional, and trained in assessing and managing cyber risks.\n18\nITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS.\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") describes the matters\nthat we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the two years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and our capital resources and liquidity as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. For the discussion of\nthe changes in our results of operations between the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, refer to Item 7,\n\"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", of our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 31, 2022, filed with the SEC on March 10, 2023, which is available on the SEC's website at\nhttps://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/ and our corporate website at www.rockybrands.com. We analyze the results of our operations\nfor the last two years (including trends in the overall business), followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, our\ncredit facilities, and our contractual commitments. We then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates we\nhave made that we believe are most important to the understanding of our MD&A and our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe conclude our MD&A with information on recent accounting pronouncements which we adopted during the year, as well as\nthose not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto,\nincluded elsewhere herein. The forward-looking statements in this section and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-\nK involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans, objectives, goals, strategies and financial\nperformance. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result\nof factors set forth under the caption \"Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\" below.\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements made by or on\nbehalf of the Company.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear and apparel marketed under a portfolio of\nwell recognized brand names including Rocky, Muck, Georgia Boot, Durango, XTRATUF, Lehigh, Ranger and the licensed\nbrand Michelin.\nOur brands have a long history of representing high quality, comfortable, functional, and durable footwear, and our products are\norganized around six target markets: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, military and western. Our footwear products\nincorporate varying features and are positioned across a range of suggested retail price points from $45.00 for our value priced\nproducts to $655.00 for our premium products. As a part of our strategy of outfitting consumers from head-to-toe, we market\ncomplementary branded apparel and accessories that we believe leverage the strength and positioning of each of our brands.\nOur products are distributed through three distinct business segments: Wholesale, Retail and Contract Manufacturing. In our\nWholesale business, we distribute our products through a wide range of distribution channels representing over 10,000 retail\nstore locations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and other international markets such as Europe. Our Wholesale channels vary by\nproduct line and include sporting goods stores, outdoor retailers, independent shoe retailers, hardware stores, catalogs, mass\nmerchants, uniform stores, farm store chains, specialty safety stores, specialty retailers, and online retailers. Our Retail business\nincludes direct sales of our products to consumers through our business-to-business web platform, e-commerce websites, third-\nparty marketplaces and our Rocky Outdoor Gear Store. Our Contract Manufacturing segment includes sales to the U.S. Military,\nprivate label sales and any sales to customers in which we are contracted to manufacture or source a specific footwear product\nfor a customer.\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, we divested the Servus brand. The gain of approximately $1.3 million on the sale of the Servus\nbrand during the first quarter was recorded within Interest Expense and Other - net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023. The Servus brand was sold to allow us to focus on our more profitable core brands and\nallocate resources toward growth and development of additional opportunities with those brands moving forward.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we closed our manufacturing facility in Rock Island, Illinois. Acquired in March of 2021 as a\npart of our acquisition of the performance and lifestyle footwear business of Honeywell International Inc, this facility primarily\nmanufactured product for the Servus brand. Following the sale of the Servus brand in the first quarter of 2023, the Rock Island\nfacility was underutilized, prompting our decision to close the facility during the third quarter of 2023.\n21\nIn 2023, we were also awarded a new multi-year contract with the U.S. Military pursuant to which we will produce and ship a\nminimum number of pairs to the U.S. Military through 2026, with an option to extend. The sales under this contract are included\nin our Contract Manufacturing segment.\nWe completed the sale of the NEOS brand during the third quarter of 2022. The sale of NEOS inventory was recorded within net\nsales and cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. The gain\non sale of the NEOS assets is recorded as a reduction of operating expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nfor the year ended December 31, 2022.\nECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nOur growth strategy is founded substantially on the expansion of our brands into new footwear and apparel markets. New\nproducts that we introduce may not be successful with consumers or one or more of our brands may fall out of favor with\nconsumers. If we are unable to anticipate, identify or react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, we may not grow\nas fast as we plan to grow, or our sales may decline, and our brand image and operating performance may suffer.\nFurthermore, achieving market acceptance for new products will likely require us to exert substantial product development and\nmarketing efforts, which could result in a material increase in our operating expenses to which there can be no assurance that we\nwill have the resources necessary to undertake such efforts. Material increases in our operating expenses could adversely impact\nour results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may also encounter difficulties in producing new products that we did not anticipate during the development stage. Our\ndevelopment schedules for new products are difficult to predict and are subject to change as a result of shifting priorities in\nresponse to consumer preferences and competing products. If we are not able to efficiently manufacture newly developed\nproducts in quantities sufficient to support retail distribution, we may not be able to recoup our investment in the development\nof new products. Failure to gain market acceptance for new products that we introduce could impede our growth, reduce our\nprofits, adversely affect the image of our brands, erode our competitive position, and result in long term harm to our business.\nAs the macroeconomic environment is continuously evolving, we are aware that global trends, such as inflationary pressures, are\nweakening consumer sentiment, negatively impacting consumer spending, and creating differing traffic patterns across channels.\nThese conditions have led to elevated inventory levels in certain markets and an increased promotional environment. We have\nalso experienced higher interest rates which have resulted in increased borrowing costs. There is ongoing uncertainty surrounding\nthe global economy and macroeconomic environment, which we expect to continue and could potentially cause disruption and\nnear-term challenges for our business.\nWe continue to monitor pressures on the global supply chain, which have shifted the timing of shipments across our brands,\nresulting in increased inventory levels outpacing our sales growth. However, we have seen improvements in transit lead times\nand related freight costs compared to the prior period, which have had a positive impact on the results of our operations through\n2023.\n2023 FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\n● Net sales decreased 25.0% to $461.8 million\n● Gross margin increased 210 basis points to 38.7%\n● Operating income decreased 19.7% to $35.4 million\n● Net income decreased 49.1% to $10.4 million, or $1.41 per diluted share\n● Total debt, net of debt issuance costs, decreased 32.6% to $173.1 million\n● Inventory decreased 28.1% to $169.2 million\n● Cash provided by operating activities increased 285% to $54.5 million\n22\nWe experienced a decline in sales of 25.0% to $461.8 million for the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the year\nending December 31, 2022, primarily attributable to our Wholesale segment. The sales decline in our Wholesale segment was\ndue to a challenging macroeconomic environment, coupled with our wholesale partners working through excess inventories.\nAdditionally, distribution challenges in 2021 led to delayed delivery of Fall 2021 inventory into the first half of 2022, creating a\ndifficult year-over-year comparison for the first nine months of 2023. While our 2023 performance was challenged by a difficult\nmacroeconomic backdrop and a tough year-over-year comparison for our Wholesale segment, we experienced strong retail sell-\nthrough and increased performance of our own e-commerce websites, which partially offset the decrease in Wholesale sales.\nDuring the year ending December 31, 2023, our gross margin improved 210 basis points to 38.7%. The increase in gross margin\nfor the year ending December 31, 2023 compared to the year ending December 31, 2022 was due to several factors. First, higher\nWholesale segment gross margins resulted from the realization of pricing actions taken the second half of 2022 and a reduction\nin inbound logistics costs. Secondly, a greater proportion of Retail segment sales, which carry higher gross margins than our\nWholesale and Contract Manufacturing segments, also contributed to the increase.\nOperating income decreased to $35.4 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating income was 7.7% in 2023 compared\nto 7.2% in 2022. The increase in operating income as a percentage of net sales was attributed to reorganization changes made\nduring 2023 in an effort to leverage top-line sales and decrease operating expenses. As a percentage of net sales, our gross margin\nincreased 210 basis points year over year while operating expenses only increased 160 basis points. The overall increase in\noperating expenses as a percentage of net sales for full year 2023, when compared to the year ago period, was attributable to\ncosts incurred prior to realizing the benefits from cost-savings reviews and operational efficiencies implemented by management\nthrough strategic initiatives, particularly in the first half of 2023. This was partially offset by lower variable costs associated with\nlower net sales. Additionally, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased in the latter half of 2023 compared to the\nsame period a year ago.\nAs of December 31, 2023 we held $4.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and our total indebtedness stood at $173.1 million,\na reduction of $84.6 million or 32.6% when compared to December 31, 2022. Of total debt paydown, $40.8 million of this\nreduction in indebtedness occurred in the fourth quarter of 2023. This created a reduction in interest expense in the fourth quarter\nof 2023 over the prior period for the first time since incurring our debt, despite increased interest rates on both of our credit\nfacilities.\nThe reduction in indebtedness was attributable to our strategic efforts to optimize inventory levels. At the end of the fourth\nquarter, inventories totaled $169.2 million, reflecting a decrease of $66.2 million or 28.1% compared to $235.4 million a year\nago.\nOur business generated cash flows from operations of $73.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2023, an increase of 285%,\nfrom $19.1 million of cash flows from operations generated for the year ending December 31, 2022. The 2023 cash flow from\noperations was primarily attributable to strategic inventory management, and improved collections on outstanding accounts\nreceivable, partially offset by payments on our accounts payable. In terms of cash flows from investing activities, we generated\n$17.3 million from the sale of the Servus brand, partially offset by $3.9 million in fixed assets purchases. As noted above, cash\nused for financing activities included an $84.6 million debt paydown and $4.6 million dividend payment to our shareholders.\nDespite facing challenges in 2023 due to a challenging macroeconomic backdrop and elevated inventory levels at several\nWholesale partners, we believe the underlying fundamentals of our business and brand portfolio remain robust. Operationally\nand financially, we believe we are well-positioned to make strategic investments in growth in future years. Throughout 2023,\nour reported results showed improvement, driven by strong sell-through of our products, and ongoing improvements to overall\ninventory levels at the majority of our wholesale accounts, positively influencing our sell-in. Our focus on product innovation,\nbrand building, consumer connections and fulfillment capabilities, has continued to strengthen with these efforts starting to yield\npositive results in the second half of 2023.\n23\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nThe following table sets forth consolidated statements of operations data as percentages of total net sales:\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2023 2022\nNET SALES: 100.0% 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 61.3 63.4\nGross margin 38.7 36.6\nOperating expenses 31.0 29.4\nIncome from operations 7.7% 7.2 %\nGross margin in 2023 was $178.6 million, or 38.7% of net sales, compared to $225.2 million, or 36.6% of net sales, in 2022. The\n210-basis point improvement was driven primarily by a 150-basis point improvement in Wholesale segment gross margins\ncombined with a higher mix of Retail segment sales, which carry higher gross margins than the Wholesale and Contract\nManufacturing segments. Operating expenses were $143.2 million, or 31.0% of net sales, in 2023 compared to $181.2 million,\nor 29.4% of net sales, in 2022. Net sales were slightly deleveraged in 2023 due to the divestures of our Servus and NEOS brands\nas well as elevated inventory levels at our retail partners within our Wholesale channel, resulting in a higher percentage\nof operating expenses of net sales in 2023 compared to 2022. Income from operations in 2023 was $35.4 million, or 7.7% of net\nsales, compared to $44.0 million, or 7.2% of net sales, in 2022. This increase was due to the increases in gross margin as a\npercentage of net sales noted above.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Inc./ (Dec.)

Furthermore,\nthe twelve months ended December 31, 2023 included only three months of net sales from the Servus brand, which was divested\nin the first quarter of 2023 (Note 4), compared to the year ago period including twelve months of net sales from the Servus\nbrand and nine months of net sales from the NEOS brand, which was divested in the third quarter of 2022 (Note 5).\nRetail net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 increased due to strong growth in our direct-to-consumer e-\ncommerce business. We have enhanced our targeted marketing efforts, primarily through digital marketing, allowing us to\nincrease brand awareness and engage more directly with consumers, which led to increased traffic on our branded websites\nthroughout the year.\nThe decrease in Contract Manufacturing sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the twelve months\nended December 31, 2022 was due to the expiration of certain contracts with the U.S. Military.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Inc./ (Dec.)\nGROSS MARGIN:\nWholesale Margin $'s $ 119,485 $ 165,059 $ (45,574)\nMargin % 35.5% 34.0% 1.5%\nRetail Margin $'s $ 58,391 $ 57,817 $ 574\nMargin % 49.9% 50.1% (0.2)%\nContract Manufacturing Margin $'s $ 722 $ 2,343 $ (1,621)\nMargin % 9.2% 15.3% (6.1)%\nTotal Margin $'s $ 178,598 $ 225,219 $ (46,621)\nMargin % 38.7% 36.6% 2.1%\n24\nThe increase in Wholesale gross margin as a percentage of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared\nto the year ago period was due to realization of pricing actions taken in 2022, as well as lower in-bound logistics costs compared\nto the year ago period.\nRetail gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 compared\nto the same period a year ago primarily due to the Lehigh business accounting for a larger percentage of Retail sales which carries\nlower margins.\nContract Manufacturing gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased for the twelve months ended 2023 compared to 2022\ndue to certain private label contracts that carried lower margins.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Inc./ (Dec.)

In addition, the decrease in operating expenses\nwas primarily attributable to cost saving reviews and operational efficiencies achieved through strategic restructuring initiatives\nimplemented over the past year.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Inc./ (Dec.) Inc./ (Dec.)\nINTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER - NET:\nOther (Expense) Income $ (21,218) $ (18,270) $ (2,948) 16.1%\nThe increase in other expenses is due to an increase in interest rates on the senior term loan and credit facility, partially offset by\nlower debt levels in 2023 compared with 2022. Additionally, the gain of $1.3 million on the sale of the Servus brand that occurred\nin the first quarter of 2023 partially offset this increase.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 Inc./ (Dec.)

Our working capital consists primarily of trade receivables and inventory, offset by\naccounts payable and accrued expenses. Our working capital fluctuates throughout the year as a result of our seasonal business\ncycle and business expansion, and is generally lowest in the months of January through March of each year and highest during\nthe months of May through October of each year. We historically utilize our revolving credit facility to fund our seasonal working\ncapital requirements. As a result, balances on our revolving credit facility could fluctuate significantly throughout the year. Our\nworking capital decreased to $186.6 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $244.8 million at the end of the prior year\nprimarily due to a decrease in inventory and accounts receivable offset by a decrease in accounts payable.\n25\nOur capital expenditures relate primarily to projects relating to our corporate offices, property, merchandising fixtures, molds\nand equipment associated with our manufacturing and distribution operations and for information technology. Capital\nexpenditures were $4.3 million for 2023 and $7.3 million in 2022. Capital expenditures for 2024 are anticipated to be\napproximately $5.5 million.\nWe lease certain machinery, equipment, and manufacturing facilities under operating leases that generally provide for renewal\noptions. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases are outlined in further detail in Note 11 of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nWe believe that our credit facilities coupled with cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our\noperations for at least the next twelve months. Our continued liquidity, however, is contingent upon future operating performance,\ncash flows and our ability to meet financial covenants under our credit facility. For more information regarding our credit\nfacilities please see Note 10.\nCash Flows and Material Cash Requirements\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in millions) 2023 2022\nOperating activities $ 73.6 $ 19.1\nInvesting activities 13.4 (1.2)\nFinancing activities (88.2) (18.1)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents $ (1.2) $ (0.2)\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $73.6 million compared\nto $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Adjusting for non-cash items, net income provided a cash in-flow of\n$22.3 million and $35.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The net change in working capital\nand other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to cash provided by operating activities of $51.3 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, compared to a decrease of $16.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the net change in working capital was primarily impacted by a decrease in inventory\nand accounts receivable of $60.0 million and $18.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of\n$21.2 million. The decrease in inventory during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the prior period was due to a\nconcentrated effort to optimize inventory levels in 2023 through increased promotions aimed at selling discontinued inventory,\nlower production and purchasing. The decrease in accounts receivable was due to collection on our outstanding accounts\nreceivables throughout the year combined with lower sales. The decrease in accounts payable was due to a decrease in our days\npayable outstanding year-over-year.\nInvesting Activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 was primarily derived\nfrom the proceeds from sale of the Servus brand (see Note 4). The principal use of net cash in 2022 was related to investments\nin molds and equipment associated with our manufacturing operations, investments in information technology and improvements\nmade to our distribution facility.\nFinancing Activities. Cash used in financing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was primarily\nrelated to payments on our revolving credit facility and term loan.\nOur prior $7,500,000 share repurchase program expired on March 4, 2022. For additional information regarding this share\nrepurchase program, see Note 14 of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have not announced a new repurchase program\nsince the expiration of the prior program.\n26\nContractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2023 resulting from financial contracts and\ncommitments. These amounts are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production, and are not\nlong-term in nature (less than three months). The following table does not include information on our recurring purchases of\nmaterials for use in our manufacturing operations.\nContractual Obligations at December 31, 2023:\nLess than 1 Over 5\n($ in millions) Total Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Years\nLong-term debt (Note 10) $ 175.0 $ 2.7 $ 5.4 $ 166.9 -\nLong-Term Taxes payable 0.2 - 0.2 - -\nMinimum operating lease commitments (Note 11) 8.5 2.8 5.6 0.1 -\nContract Liabilities (Note 17) 0.9 0.9 - - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 184.6 $ 6.4 $ 11.2 $ 167.0 $ -\nFrom time to time, we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms. Any significant\nlosses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At December\n31, 2023, no such losses existed.\nOur ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws, rules and regulations as may be issued\nand enforced by various federal, state and local agencies. With respect to environmental matters, costs are incurred pertaining to\nregulatory compliance. Such costs have not been, and are not anticipated to become, material.\nWe are contingently liable with respect to lawsuits, taxes and various other matters that routinely arise in the normal course of\nbusiness. See Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of legal matters. We do not have off-\nbalance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities, also known as \"Variable Interest\nEntities.\" Additionally, we do not have any related party transactions that materially affect the results of operations, cash flow or\nfinancial condition.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2023.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect\nthe amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates these\nestimates. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under\nthe circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities\nthat are not readily apparent from other sources. Historically, actual results have not been materially different from the Company's\nestimates. However, actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The\nCompany has identified the following critical accounting policies used in determining estimates and assumptions in the amounts\nreported. Management believes that an understanding of these policies is important to an overall understanding of the Company's\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 1 to the Company's Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue principally consists of sales to customers, and, to a lesser extent, license fees. See Note 1 and Note 17 of our\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding revenues.\n27\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nManagement maintains allowances for uncollectible accounts and estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers\nto make required payments. We evaluate the allowance for credit losses based on a review of current customer status and\nhistorical collection experience along with current and reasonable supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. If the\nfinancial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional\nallowances may be required.\nSales returns and allowances\nWe record a reduction to gross sales based on estimated customer returns and allowances. These reductions are influenced by\nhistorical experience based on customer returns and allowances. The actual amount of sales returns and allowances realized may\ndiffer from our estimates. If we determine that sales returns or allowances should be either increased or decreased, then the\nadjustment would be made to net sales in the period in which such a determination is made.\nSales returns and allowances as a percentage of sales for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were 8.4% and 6.7%,\nrespectively.\nInventories\nManagement identifies slow moving inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related to these inventories.\nHistorically, these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of our inventories are considered saleable and\nwe have been able to liquidate slow moving or obsolete inventories at amounts above cost through our factory outdoor gear stores\nor through various discounts to customers and e-commerce channels. Should management encounter difficulties liquidating slow\nmoving or obsolete inventories, additional provisions may be necessary. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of our\ninventory reserves and makes adjustments as required. See Note 6 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional\ninformation regarding inventories.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or\nwhenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the\nassets below their carrying amount. Events or circumstances that might indicate an interim evaluation is warranted include,\namong other things, unexpected adverse business conditions, macro and reporting unit specific economic factors, supply costs,\nand unanticipated competitive activities.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter each fiscal year by\nquantitatively comparing the fair values of the Wholesale and Retail reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles to their\ncarrying amounts. There was no goodwill allocated to our Contract Manufacturing reporting unit.\nFor goodwill, we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit by weighing the results of the income and market approaches.\nThese valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information,\ngrowth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make\ncertain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and future profitability of our business. When performing\nthe income approach, we utilize the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value. The future cash flows for our reporting\nunits were projected based on our estimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income, and other factors (such as working\ncapital and capital expenditures). The discount rates used were based on a weighted-average cost of capital determined from\nrelevant market comparisons and take into consideration the risk and nature of the respective reporting unit's cash flows. For the\nmarket approach, we use the guideline public company method which relies upon valuation multiples derived from stock prices\nand enterprise values of publicly traded companies that are comparable to the reporting unit being evaluated.\nThe fair value of our trade names was determined based on the Income Approach using the Relief from Royalty Method. This\nmethod requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted average\ncost of capital.\nAfter completing our annual impairment test for each reporting unit and our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth\nquarter of 2023 and 2022, we concluded there was no impairment in either of these years.\n28\nWe did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The estimated fair\nvalues of the Wholesale reporting unit and the Retail reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts at the date of testing by\nmore than 20% for both 2023 and 2022.\nIncome taxes\nManagement records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets for a portion of state and local income tax net\noperating losses that it believes may not be realized. We have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible\ntax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance; however, in the event we were to determine that we would\nnot be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be\ncharged to income in the period such determination was made. For additional information see Note 13 of our Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nRECENT FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements adopted during the current year and\nthe expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted. To the extent the adoption\nof new accounting standards materially affects financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity, the impacts are discussed\nin the applicable section of this MD&A and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations, contains\nforward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section\n27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby.

We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking\nstatements.\n29\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nIn the normal course of business, our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks,\nincluding market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and currency rate movements on non-U.S. dollar\ndenominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. We are also subject to commodity pricing risk via changes in the price of materials\nused in our manufacturing process. We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that\nshould mitigate a portion of the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our senior term facility and revolving\ncredit facility. Our senior term and revolving credit facilities are tied to changes in applicable interest rates, including SOFR,\ncompany performance and total borrowings under our revolving credit facility.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $175.0 million of debt consisting of $77.9 million under our senior term facility and\n$97.1 million under our revolving credit facility. For additional information about our credit facilities see Note 10.\nWe do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes.\nWe do not have any interest rate management agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nCommodity Risk\nWe are also exposed to changes in the price of commodities used in our manufacturing operations. However, commodity price\nrisk related to our current commodities is not material as price changes in commodities can generally be passed along to the\ncustomer.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our foreign assets, liabilities and\ninventory purchase commitments. We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should\nmitigate a portion of the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures.\n30\nITEM 8.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ...................................................................................................... 58\n31\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nRocky Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNelsonville, Ohio\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rocky Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for\neach of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule\nlisted in the index at Item 15(a)(2), (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements\npresent fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results\nof its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (COSO), and our report dated March 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,\nas well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involve our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgment. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n32\nValuation of Indefinite-Lived Identified Intangibles in Conjunction with\nAnnual Impairment Testing\nDescription of the Matter At December 31, 2023, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets were approximately\n$126.5 million, which included $78.7 million of trade names and trademarks and\n$47.8 million of goodwill. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are tested for potential impairment annually or when conditions indicate\nimpairment may have occurred. This test was performed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAuditing management’s indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, was\nchallenging because there is significant judgment required in determining the methodologies\nand assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s goodwill by reporting\nunit, and trade names and trademarks by brand. In particular, the fair value estimates were\nsensitive to significant judgment assumptions including future cash flows, long-term growth\nrates of the business, financial projections, operating margins, weighted average cost of\ncapital and other factors such as: discount rates, royalty rates, cost of capital, and market\nmultiples. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to\nthese estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or\nimpairment for each of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nHow We Addressed the We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness\nMatter in Our Audit of controls over the Company’s intangible asset impairment review process. To test the\nestimated fair value of the Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, we performed audit procedures\nthat included, among others, involving our valuation specialists in evaluating the\nmethodologies used and significant assumptions described above, and testing the underlying\ndata used by the Company for completeness and accuracy. We compared the significant\nassumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, recent historical\nperformance, changes to the reporting unit’s business model and other relevant factors. We\nevaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s financial projections used in the\nanalysis. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and significant\nassumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result\nfrom changes in the assumptions. We evaluated the incorporation of the applicable\nassumptions into the model and tested the model’s computational accuracy and performed a\nsensitivity analysis on certain key assumptions.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\n/s/ Schneider Downs & Co., Inc.\nColumbus, Ohio\nMarch 15, 2024\n33\nRocky Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share amounts)\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2023 2022\nASSETS:\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,470 $ 5,719\nTrade receivables – net 77,028 94,953\nContract receivables 927 -\nOther receivables 1,933 908\nInventories – net 169,201 235,400\nIncome tax receivable 1,253 -\nPrepaid expenses 3,361 4,067\nTotal current assets 258,173 341,047\nLEASED ASSETS 7,809 11,014\nPROPERTY, PLANT & EQUIPMENT – net 51,976 57,359\nGOODWILL 47,844 50,246\nIDENTIFIED INTANGIBLES – net 112,618 121,782\nOTHER ASSETS 965 942\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 479,385 $ 582,390\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable $ 49,840 $ 69,686\nContract liabilities 927 -\nCurrent Portion of Long-Term Debt 2,650 3,250\nAccrued expenses:\nSalaries and wages 1,204 1,253\nTaxes – other 925 1,325\nAccrued freight 2,284 2,413\nCommissions 904 1,934\nAccrued duty 5,440 6,764\nAccrued interest 2,104 2,822\nIncome tax payable - 1,172\nOther 5,251 5,675\nTotal current liabilities 71,529 96,294\nLONG-TERM DEBT 170,480 253,646\nLONG-TERM TAXES PAYABLE 169 169\nLONG-TERM LEASE 5,461 8,216\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES 7,475 8,006\nDEFERRED LIABILITIES 716 586\nTOTAL LIABILITIES 255,830 366,917\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCommon stock, no par value;\n25,000,000 shares authorized;

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Rocky Brands, Inc.\n(\"Rocky Brands\") and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Lifestyle Footwear, Inc. (\"Lifestyle\"), Five Star Enterprises Ltd. (\"Five\nStar\"), Rocky Brands Canada, Inc. (\"Rocky Brands Canada\"), Rocky Brands US, LLC, Rocky Brands International, LLC, Lehigh\nOutfitters, LLC, US Footwear Holdings, LLC, Rocky Brands (Australia) Pty Ltd., Mexico FW Holdings, S. de R.L. de C.V.,\nRocky Footwear (Chuzhou) Co. Ltd., UK Footwear Holdings Limited and Rocky Outdoor Gear Store, LLC (collectively referred\nto as the \"Company\"). All inter-company transactions have been eliminated.\nBusiness Activity - We are a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of premium quality footwear marketed under a\nportfolio of well recognized brand names including Rocky, Muck, Georgia Boot, Durango, XTRATUF, Lehigh, Ranger and the\nlicensed brand Michelin. Our brands have a long history of representing high quality, comfortable, functional and durable\nfootwear and our products are organized around six target markets: outdoor, work, duty, commercial military, western and\nmilitary. In addition, as part of our strategy of outfitting consumers from head-to-toe, we market complementary branded apparel\nand accessories that we believe leverage the strength and positioning of each of our brands.\nOur products are distributed through three distinct business segments: Wholesale, Retail and Contract Manufacturing. Wholesale\nincludes sales of footwear and accessories to several classifications of retailers, including sporting goods stores, outdoor specialty\nstores, online retailers, marine stores, independent retailers, mass merchants, retail uniform stores and specialty safety shoe stores.\nOur Retail business includes direct sales of our products to consumers through our e-commerce websites, marketplaces, our\nRocky Outdoor Gear Store, and Lehigh businesses. Contract Manufacturing includes sales to the U.S. Military, private label sales\nand any sales to customers in which we are contracted to manufacture or source a specific footwear product for a customer.\nSee Note 19 for further information.\nEstimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents - We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or\nless to be cash equivalents. Balances may exceed federally insured limits. We also hold cash outside of the U.S. that is not\nfederally insured.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - We maintain an allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable that represents estimated losses\nresulting from customers’ failure to make required payments. We evaluate the allowance for credit losses based on a review of\ncurrent customer status and historical collection experience along with current and reasonable supportable forecasts of future\neconomic conditions.\nTrade Receivables - Trade receivables are presented net of the related allowance for credit losses of approximately $1.8 million\nand $3.5 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We record the allowance based on historical experience, the age\nof the receivables, and identification of customer accounts that are likely to prove difficult to collect due to various criteria\nincluding pending bankruptcy. However, estimates of the allowance in any future period are inherently uncertain and actual\nallowances may differ from these estimates. If actual or expected future allowances were significantly greater or less than\nestablished reserves, a reduction or increase to bad debt expense would be recorded in the period this determination was made.\nOur credit policy generally provides that trade receivables will be deemed uncollectible and written-off once we have pursued\nall reasonable efforts to collect on the account. In accordance with ASC 606, the return reserve liability netted against trade\nreceivables was $1.5 million and $2.1 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nConcentration of Credit Risk - We have significant transactions with a large number of customers. No customer represented\n10% of net trade receivables as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Our exposure to credit risk is impacted by the economic climate\naffecting the retail shoe industry. We manage this risk by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers, maintaining\nreserves for potential uncollectible accounts and utilizing credit insurance for some of our key customers.\n38\nSupplier and Labor Concentrations - We purchase raw materials from a number of domestic and foreign sources. We produce\na portion of our shoes and boots in our Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and China operations. We are not aware of any\ngovernmental or economic restrictions that would alter these current operations.\nWe source a significant portion of our footwear, apparel and gloves from manufacturers in Asia, primarily in China and Vietnam.\nWe are not aware of any governmental or economic restrictions that would alter our current sourcing operations.\nInventories - Inventories are valued at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis, or net realizable value\n(NRV). Reserves are established for inventories when the NRV is deemed to be less than its cost based on our periodic estimates\nof NRV.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment - We record fixed assets at historical cost and generally utilizes the straight-line method of\ncomputing depreciation for financial reporting purposes over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nYears\nBuildings and improvements 5 - 40\nMachinery and equipment 3 - 8\nFurniture and fixtures 3 - 8\nLasts, dies, and patterns 3\nFor income tax purposes, we generally compute depreciation utilizing accelerated methods.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible\nand identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Indefinite-lived intangibles include trademarks and trade names.\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairments tests at least\nannually. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by reporting unit at least\nannually, or when indicators of impairment are present, to determine if such assets may be impaired.\nThe Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill\nand indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying value. The Company would not be required to quantitatively\ndetermine the fair value unless the Company determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that\nits fair value is less than the carrying value.\nThe Company performs its annual testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment in the fourth quarter of\nthe fiscal year for all reporting units. Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated\nfair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. An impairment\ncharge is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. An indefinite-lived intangible asset\nis quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value. An\nimpairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nOther intangible assets determined to have a finite life primarily consist of customer relationships and patents, which are\namortized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line amortization. We review intangible assets with finite lives for\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nDetermining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future\nforecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group.\nFor additional details on goodwill and intangible assets, including information related to our annual test, see Note 8.\nLeases - Our leases primarily consist of office buildings, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities and equipment. We lease\nassets in the normal course of business to meet our current and future needs while providing flexibility to our operations. We enter\ninto contracts with third parties to lease specifically identified assets. Most of our leases have contractually specified renewal\nperiods. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2027, and contain various provisions for rental adjustments and\nrenewal provisions for varying periods. We determine the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and\nfactor in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nUnder FASB ASC Topic 842, Leases, we have elected the practical expedient to account for lease components and nonlease\ncomponents associated with individual leases as a single lease component for all leases. In addition, we have elected to account\nfor multiple lease components as a single lease component. Our leases may include variable lease costs such as payments based\non changes to an index, payments based on a percentage of retail store sales, and maintenance, utilities, shared marketing or other\nservice costs that are paid directly to the lessor under terms of the lease. We recognize variable lease payments when the amounts\n39\nare incurred and determinable. We have elected to account for leases of twelve months or less as short-term leases and\naccordingly do not recognize a right-of-use asset or lease liability for these leases. We recognize lease expense for these leases\non a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nComprehensive Income - Comprehensive income includes changes in equity that result from transactions and economic events\nfrom non-core operations. Comprehensive income is composed of two subsets – net income and other comprehensive income.\nThere were no material other comprehensive income items therefore no Statements of Comprehensive Income were presented.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is completed at a point in time and when the\ncustomer has obtained control. Control passes to the customer when they have the ability to direct the use of and obtain\nsubstantially all the remaining benefits from the goods transferred. We recognize wholesale and e-commerce revenue at the time\nthe products are shipped and retail store revenue transactions at the point of sale. The amount of revenue recognized is based on\nthe transaction price, which represents the invoiced amount less estimated sales discounts and returns based upon specific\ncustomer agreements and historical trends. The Company presents revenue gross of fees and sales commissions. Sales\ncommissions are expensed as incurred and are recorded in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of\noperations. The Company's customer contracts do not have a significant financing component due to their short durations, which\nare typically effective for one year or less and have payment terms that generally range from net 30 to net 120 days.\nCost of Goods Sold - Cost of goods sold represents our costs to manufacture products in our own facilities, including raw\nmaterials costs and all overhead expenses related to production, as well as the cost to purchase finished products from our third-\nparty manufacturers. Cost of goods sold also includes the cost to transport these products to our distribution centers.\nAdvertising - We expense advertising costs as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $16.6 million, $15.4 million\nand $17.9 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nShipping Costs - All shipping costs billed to customers have been included in net sales. All outbound shipping costs to customers\nhave been included in operating expenses and totaled approximately $25.1 million, $38.5 million and $25.1 million in\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStock Compensation Expense - We recognize compensation expense for awards of stock options, restricted stock units\n(\"RSUs\"), and director stock units based on the fair value on the grant date and on a straight-line basis over the requisite service\nperiod for the awards that are expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated based on our historical experience and future\nexpectations. Stock-based compensation is included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurements - The fair value accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair\nvalue, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This standard clarifies how to measure fair value as permitted\nunder other accounting pronouncements.\nThe fair value accounting standard defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer\na liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants at the measurement date. This standard also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the\ninputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use\nof unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n● Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n● Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets\nand liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not\nactive, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\n● Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value\nof the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\nThe fair values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, and payables approximated their carrying values because of the short-\nterm nature of these instruments. Receivables consist primarily of amounts due from our customers, net of allowances; amounts\ndue from employees (salespersons’ advances in excess of commissions earned and employee travel advances); other customer\nreceivables, net of allowances; and expected insurance recoveries. The carrying amounts of our long-term credit facilities and\nother short-term financing obligations also approximate fair value, as they are comparable to the available financing in the\nmarketplace during the year. The fair value of our revolving line of credit is categorized as Level 2.\n40\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities - On December 14, 2018, our Board of Directors adopted the Rocky Brands,\nInc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the \"Executive Deferred Compensation Plan\"), which became effective January 1,\n2019. The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which certain\nexecutives are eligible to participate. The deferrals are held in a separate trust, which has been established for the administration\nof the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. The trust assets and liabilities are classified as trading securities within prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets and deferred liabilities, respectively in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with\nchanges in the deferred compensation charged to operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nThe fair value is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for the funds in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency\n(Level 1).\nEffective August 18, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a second deferred compensation plan (the \"Dominican Plan\"). The\nDominican Plan is an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for key employees at our Dominican Republic\nmanufacturing facility. The funds are held in a separate trust, which has been established for the administration of the Dominican\nPlan. The trust liabilities are classified as trading securities within deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets, with changes in the deferred compensation charged to operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements\nof operations. The fair value is based on unadjusted quoted market prices for the funds in active markets with sufficient volume\nand frequency (Level 1).\n2.

BUSINESS ACQUISITION\nThe Performance and Lifestyle Footwear Business of Honeywell International Inc.\nOn January 24, 2021, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with certain subsidiaries of Honeywell\nInternational Inc. (collectively, \"Honeywell\"), to purchase Honeywell's performance and lifestyle footwear business, including\nbrand names, trademarks, assets and liabilities associated with Honeywell's performance and lifestyle footwear business (the\n\"Acquisition\") for an aggregate, adjusted purchase price of $212 million.\nOn March 15, 2021 (the \"Acquisition Date\"), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we\ncompleted the Acquisition for an aggregate preliminary closing price of approximately $207 million, net of cash acquired, based\non preliminary working capital and other adjustments. Upon a final agreement of net working capital as of the Acquisition Date,\nwe owed Honeywell an additional $5.4 million. The Acquisition was funded through cash on hand and borrowings under two\nnew credit facilities. See Note 10 for information regarding the two credit facilities.\nThe Acquisition expanded our brand portfolio to include Muck, XTRATUF, Servus, Ranger and NEOS brands (the \"Acquired\nBrands\"). We acquired 100% of the voting interests of certain subsidiaries and additional assets comprising the performance and\nlifestyle footwear business of Honeywell with the Acquisition. On March 30, 2023, we completed the sale of the Servus brand\nand the related assets. See Note 4 for additional information. On September 30, 2022, we completed the sale of the NEOS brand\nand the related assets. See Note 5 for additional information.\nThrough the Acquisition, we have greatly enhanced our powerful portfolio of footwear brands and significantly increased our\nsales and profitability. We acquired a well-run business with a corporate culture and a customer base similar to ours, which\nprovides meaningful growth opportunities within our existing product categories as well as an entry into new market segments.\nIts innovative and authentic product collections complement our existing offering with minimal overlap, which we believe will\nallow us to strengthen our wholesale relationships and serve a wider consumer audience. At the same time, we plan to leverage\nour existing advanced fulfillment capabilities to improve distribution of the Acquired Brands to wholesale customers and\naccelerate direct-to-consumer penetration.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we also entered into employment agreements with seven key employees from the\nperformance and lifestyle footwear business of Honeywell, pursuant to which, among other things, we agreed to grant 25,000\nnon-qualified stock options in the aggregate to the seven employees as an inducement for continuing their employment with us.\nWe acquired multiple leases through the Acquisition including the lease of our Rock Island and China manufacturing facilities\nand an office building lease in Westwood, Massachusetts. We closed the Rock Island manufacturing Facility in September 2023\nand we closed the office in Westwood, Massachusetts in December 2022.\n42\nThe Acquisition contributed net sales of $161.9 million, $242.8 million, and $179.0 million to our consolidated operating results\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Acquisition contributed net income of $16.4 million,\n$9.3 million, and $16.5 million to our consolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nAcquisition-related costs\nCosts incurred to complete and integrate the Acquisition are expensed as incurred and included in \"operating expenses\" in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 there were\napproximately $2.8 million, $3.5 million and $11.9 million, respectively, of Acquisition-related costs recognized. These costs\nrepresent investment banking fees, legal and professional fees, transaction fees, integration costs, amortization and consulting\nfees associated with the Acquisition.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nThe Acquisition has been accounted for under the business combinations accounting guidance. As a result, we have applied\nacquisition accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their\nfair values as of the Acquisition Date. The aggregate closing price noted above was allocated to the major categories of assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the Acquisition Date using primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs.\nThese Level 2 and Level 3 valuation inputs include an estimate of future cash flows and discount rates. Additionally, estimated\nfair values are based, in part, upon outside valuation for certain assets, including specifically identified intangible assets.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the residual amount allocated to\ngoodwill was as follows:\n($ in thousands) Fair Value\nCash $ 2,655\nAccounts receivable (1) 36,734\nInventories (2) 41,057\nProperty, plant and equipment 16,243\nGoodwill (3) 50,246\nIntangible assets 98,620\nOther assets 1,250\nAccounts payable (18,108)\nAccrued expenses (13,634)\nTotal identifiable net assets 215,063\nCash acquired (2,655)\nTotal cash paid, net of cash acquired $ 212,408\n(1) The recorded amount for accounts receivable considers expected uncollectible amounts of approximately $0.6 million in its\ndetermination of fair value.\n(2) Fair value of finished goods inventories included step up value of approximately $3.5 million, all of which was expensed\nduring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, and is included in \"Cost of Goods Sold\" in the accompanying\nconsolidated statement of operations.\n(3) Goodwill largely consists of the acquired workforce, expected costs synergies and economies of scale resulting from the\nAcquisition.\n43\nUnaudited Pro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma results of operations assume that the Acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods\npresented. These unaudited pro forma results are presented for information purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of\nwhat the results of operations would have been if the Acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are\nthey indicative of the future results of operations. The pro forma results presented below are adjusted for the removal of the step\nup value of finished goods inventory associated with the Acquisition of approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December\n31, 2021. The pro forma results presented below are also adjusted for the removal of Acquisition-related costs of approximately\n$2.8 million, $3.5 million and $11.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands, except per share amount) 2023 2022 2021\nNet sales $ 461,833 $ 615,475 $ 552,905\nNet income $ 12,518 $ 23,250 $ 40,248\nDiluted earnings per share $ 1.70 $ 3.16 $ 5.43\n4. SALE OF SERVUS BRAND AND RELATED ASSETS\nOn March 30, 2023, we completed the sale of the Servus brand and related assets to PQ Footwear, LLC and Petroquim\nS.R.L. (collectively \"the Buyer\"). Total consideration for this transaction was approximately $19.0 million, of which\n$17.3 million was received at closing. The remaining $1.7 million will be paid out in accordance with the purchase agreement.\nThe sale of the Servus brand included the sale of inventory, fixed assets, customer relationships, tradenames and goodwill, all of\nwhich related to our Wholesale segment. In connection with the sale of the Servus brand we also are licensing the rights to certain\nproprietary processes to the Buyer. We recorded a gain on the sale of Servus of approximately $1.3 million which is recorded\nwithin Interest Expense and Other - net on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\n5. SALE OF NEOS BRAND AND RELATED ASSETS\nOn September 30, 2022, we completed the sale of the NEOS brand and related assets to certain entities controlled by SureWerx\npursuant to terms of an asset purchase agreement dated September 30, 2022. Total consideration for this transaction was\napproximately $5.8 million, of which $5.5 million was received at closing. The remaining $0.3 million was deposited in escrow\nand shall be managed and paid out in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement and the escrow agreement. The\nsale of the NEOS brand included the sale of inventory, fixed assets, customer relationships, and tradenames, all of which related\nto our Wholesale segment. This transaction resulted in the sale of inventory of approximately $3.6 million recorded in net sales\nand approximately $2.4 million recorded in costs of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the\ntwelve months ended December 31, 2022. Fixed assets, customer relationships and tradenames sold in connection with the sale\nof the NEOS brand resulted in reduction of operating expenses of approximately $0.7 million recorded in the\naccompanying consolidated statement of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.\n6.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values of\nour reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. For goodwill, we estimated the fair\nvalue of each reporting unit by weighing the results of the income and market approaches. These valuation approaches consider\na number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, discount rates, and\ncomparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates\nregarding industry economic factors and future profitability of our business. When performing the income approach, we utilize\nthe present value of cash flows to estimate fair value. The future cash flows for our reporting units were projected based on our\nestimates, at that time, of future revenues, operating income, and other factors (such as working capital and capital expenditures).\nThe discount rates used were based on a weighted-average cost of capital determined from relevant market comparisons and take\ninto consideration the risk and nature of the respective reporting unit's cash flows. For the market approach, we use the guideline\npublic company method which relies upon valuation multiples derived from stock prices and enterprise values of publicly traded\ncompanies that are comparable to the reporting unit being evaluated. To further confirm fair value, we compare the aggregate\nfair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization.\nThe fair value of our trade names was determined based on the income approach using the Relief from Royalty Method. This\nmethod requires us to estimate the future revenues for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate, and the weighted-average\ncost of capital.\nWe consider the assumptions used in our determination of the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived\nintangible assets to be reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants; however, actual\nevents and results could differ substantially from the estimates used in our valuations. These assumptions include, among other\nthings, estimating future cash flows, including projected revenue and operating results, as well as selecting appropriate discount\nrates, pricing multiples, and an assumed royalty rate. If an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and\nassumptions used in analyzing the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, the revision could result in a non-cash\nimpairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nEstimates utilized in the projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, expected growth rates, cost\ncontainment and margin expansion, business plans, market position, and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated\nmarket or macroeconomic events and circumstances such as supply chain disruptions and the loss of key customers could\nnegatively affect key assumptions used for the recent fair value test and potentially result in goodwill impairment.\nAfter completing our annual impairment test for each reporting unit and our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth\nquarter of 2023 and 2022, we concluded there was no impairment in either of these years.\n45\nWe did not have any reporting units that were at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. The estimated fair\nvalues of the Wholesale and the Retail reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts at the date of testing by more than 20%\nfor both 2023 and 2022.\nThe amount of our goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes is $47.0 million.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nGoodwill balance at beginning of the year $ 50,246 $ 50,246\nSale of Business (1) (2,402) -\nGoodwill balance at end of the year (2) $ 47,844 $ 50,246\n(1) Relates to the divesture of the Servus brand during the year ended December 31, 2023, see Note 4 for additional\ninformation.\n(2) As of December 31, 2023, goodwill allocated to our Wholesale and Retail reporting segments was $23.0 million and $24.8\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, goodwill allocated to our Wholesale and Retail reporting segments was\n$25.4 million and $24.8 million, respectively.

LONG-TERM DEBT\nOn March 15, 2021, we entered into a senior secured term loan facility (\"Term Facility\") with TCW Asset Management\nCompany, LLC, as agent, for the lenders party thereto in the amount of $130 million. The Term Facility provided for quarterly\npayments of principal and bears interest of LIBOR plus 7.00% through June 30, 2021. After this date, interest was assessed\nquarterly based on our total leverage ratio. The total leverage ratio is calculated as (a) Total Debt to (b) EBITDA. If our total\nleverage ratio is greater than or equal to 4.00, the effective interest rate will be SOFR plus 7.50% (or at our option, Prime Rate\nplus 6.50%). If our total leverage ratio is less than 4.00, but greater than 3.00, the effective interest rate will be SOFR plus 7.00%\n(or at our option, Prime Rate plus 6.00%). If our total leverage ratio is less than 3.00, the effective interest rate will be SOFR\nplus 6.50% (or at our option, Prime Rate plus 5.50%). The Term Facility also has a SOFR floor rate of 1.00%. In June 2022, we\nentered into a second amendment with TCW to amend our Term Facility to consent to modifications in our borrowing capacity\nunder the ABL Facility as described below, and to adjust certain pricing and prepayment terms, among other things. The second\namendment also modified the interest index whereas SOFR will be used to calculate interest rather than LIBOR. The effective\ninterest rate was increased to SOFR plus 7.50% through November 2022. In November 2022, the Term Facility was amended to\nincrease the effective interest rate to LIBOR plus 7.00% until June 2023 and to provide certain EBITDA adjustments with\nresponse to financial covenants, among other things. In May 2023, we entered into a fourth amendment with TCW to further\namend our Term Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments in respect of the financial covenants, adjust the method to\ncalculate total debt, continue certain pricing terms, extend certain prepayment terms, and pay such lenders certain amendment\nfees, among other things. In October 2023, we entered into a sixth amendment with TCW to further amend our Term Facility to\nprovide certain EBITDA adjustments with respect to the financial covenants, adjust the performance pricing grid, and adjust the\ntotal leverage ratio periodically through June 30, 2025, among other things.\nOur Term Facility is collateralized by a second-lien on accounts receivable, inventory, cash and related assets, and a first-lien on\nsubstantially all other assets. The Term Facility matures on March 15, 2026.\n47\nOn March 15, 2021, we also entered into a senior secured asset-based credit facility (\"ABL Facility\") with Bank of America,\nN.A. (\"Bank of America\") as agent, for the lenders party thereto. The ABL Facility provides a new senior secured asset-based\nrevolving credit facility up to a principal amount of $150 million, which includes a sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit\nup to $5 million. The ABL Facility may be increased up to an additional $50 million at the Borrowers’ request and the Lenders’\noption, subject to customary conditions. In December of 2021, we amended our ABL Facility to temporarily increase our\nborrowing capacity from $150 million to $175 million until June 2022, at which time our borrowing capacity would have went\ndown to $165 million. In June 2022, we further amended our ABL Facility to temporarily increase our borrowing capacity by\n$25 million to $200 million through December 31, 2022, which thereafter would have been reduced to $175 million. In November\n2022, we entered into a third amendment to our ABL Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments with respect to our financial\ncovenant. The ABL Facility includes a separate first in, last out (FILO) tranche, which allows the Company to borrow at higher\nadvance rates on eligible accounts receivables and inventory balances. In October 2023, we entered into a fifth amendment to\nour ABL Facility to provide certain EBITDA adjustments with respect to our financial covenant. As of December 31, 2023, we\nhad borrowing capacity of $31.1 million.\nInterest expense was approximately $22.7 million, $18.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively, for the years ended December\n31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe ABL Facility is collateralized by first-lien on accounts receivable, inventory, cash and related assets and a second-lien on\nsubstantially all other assets. The ABL Facility matures on March 15, 2026. Interest on the ABL Facility is based on the amount\navailable to be borrowed as set forth on the following chart:\nAverage Availability as a Term SOFR Base Rate for Term SOFR\nRevolver Pricing Level Percentage of Commitments Base Rate Loan FILO FILO Loans\nI > 66.7% 0.00% 1.25% 0.50% 1.75%\nII >33.3% and < or equal to 66.7% 0.00% 1.50% 0.50% 2.00%\nIII < or equal to 33.3% 0.25% 1.75% 0.75% 2.25%\n(1) Tier II applied until June 30, 2021.\nIn connection with the Term Facility and ABL Facility, we had to pay certain fees that were capitalized and will be amortized\nover the life of each respective loan. In addition, the ABL Facility requires us to pay an annual collateral management fee in the\namount of $75,000 due on each anniversary of the ABL Facility issuance date, until it matures.\nCurrent and long-term debt consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nTerm Facility that matures in 2026 with an effective interest rate of 13.20% and 12.14%\nas of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively $ 77,932 $ 116,332\nABL Facility that matures in 2026:\nSOFR borrowings with an effective interest rate of 7.31% and 5.47% as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively 83,144 140,000\nPrime borrowings with an effective interest rate of 8.75% and 7.27% as of December 31,\n2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively 13,938 3,301\nTotal debt 175,014 259,633\nLess: Unamortized debt issuance costs (1,884) (2,737)\nTotal debt, net of debt issuance costs 173,130 256,896\nLess: Debt maturing within one year (2,650) (3,250)\nLong-term debt $ 170,480 $ 253,646\nCredit Facility Covenants\nThe Term Facility contains restrictive covenants which require us to maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum\nfixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the agreement.

BENEFIT PLAN\nWe sponsor a 401(k) savings plan for eligible employees. We provide a contribution of 3% of applicable salary to the plan for\nall employees with greater than six months of service. Additionally, we match eligible employee contributions at a rate of 0.25%,\nper one percent of applicable salary contributed to the plan by the employee. This matching contribution will be made by us up\nto a maximum of 1% of the employee’s applicable salary for all qualified employees.\nOur approximate contributions to the 401(k) Plan were as follows:\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2022\n401k plan sponsor contributions $ 1,531 $ 1,798 $ 1,311\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nThe Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, which became effective January 1, 2019, is an unfunded non-qualified deferred\ncompensation plan in which certain executives are eligible to participate.\nUnder the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may elect to defer up to 75% of their base compensation and up\nto 100% of their bonuses, commissions, and other compensation. The deferred amounts are paid in accordance with each\nparticipant’s elections made on or before December 31 of the prior year. In addition to elective deferrals, the Executive Deferred\nCompensation Plan permits the Company to make discretionary contributions to eligible participants, provided that any\nparticipant who is employed on the last day of a plan year will receive a Company contribution equal to no less than 3% of the\nparticipant’s base compensation, bonus earned, and non-equity incentive plan compensation in the plan year. Company\ncontributions will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule determined by the Committee, except in the event of the\nparticipant’s death, disability or retirement, in which case the contributions will vest 100% upon such event. Participants may\nelect to receive payment in a lump sum cash payment or, in the event of the participant’s retirement, in annual installments for a\nperiod of up to ten years. In the event of a participant’s termination of employment, deferred amounts will generally be paid\nwithin 60 days following the later of the date (i) of such termination or (ii) the participant attains age 60, except where such\ntermination is due to such participant’s death, in which case deferred amounts will be paid to such participant’s beneficiary within\n30 days of confirmation of the participant’s death.\nThe deferrals are held in a separate trust, which has been established by the Company to administer the Executive Deferred\nCompensation Plan. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors in the event that the Company\nbecomes insolvent. Consequently, the trust qualifies as a grantor trust for income tax purposes (i.e., a \"Rabbi Trust\"). The assets\nheld by the trust were approximately $0.4 million and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,\nrespectively, and are classified as trading securities within other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The\nliabilities held under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan were approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million, as\nof December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are classified within deferred liabilities in the accompanying\nconsolidated balance sheets. Changes in the deferred compensation assets and liabilities are charged to operating expenses in the\naccompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nIn 2020, we entered into a second deferred compensation plan (the \"Dominican Plan\"), which became effective August 18, 2020\nand is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain key employees at our Dominican Republic manufacturing facility.\n50\nUnder the Dominican Plan, key employees will receive a set dollar amount, as defined in the agreement, at the later of five years\nfollowing the effective date of the agreement or upon the employee attaining the age of 65. Payments are due within 30 days of\nthe employee's retirement. If the employee terminates their employment, for any reason, prior to their retirement and five years\nafter the effective date of the agreement, the employee is not eligible to receive a payout. The funds are accrued based on service\nand are not held in an investment or trust account. The total liabilities held under the Dominican Plan were approximately\n$0.3 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and are classified within deferred\nliabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\n13. TAXES\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting standard for \"Income Taxes,\" which requires an asset and liability\napproach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have been provided for the\ntemporary differences between the financial reporting and the income tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities by\napplying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to the basis differences.\nA breakdown of our income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nFederal:\nCurrent $ 3,877 $ 5,993 $ 1,554\nDeferred (977) (1,417) 1,729\nTotal Federal 2,900 4,576 3,283\nState & local:\nCurrent 262 1,415 833\nDeferred 123 (247) (176)\nTotal State & local 385 1,168 657\nForeign\nCurrent 106 182 907\nDeferred 337 (623) (37)\nTotal Foreign 443 (441) 870\nTotal $ 3,728 $ 5,303 $ 4,810\nA reconciliation of recorded Federal income tax expense to the expected expense computed by applying the applicable Federal\nstatutory rate for all periods to income before income taxes follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nExpected expense at statutory rate $ 2,975 $ 5,414 $ 5,327\nIncrease (decrease) in income taxes resulting from:\nExempt income from Dominican Republic operations due to tax\nholiday (476) (632) (1,238)\nTax Rate Differential effect of Foreign Operations 106 160 45\nTax on repatriated earnings from Dominican Republic operations 190 316 941\nState and local income taxes 407 734 222\nForeign Tax Credit (227) (348) (547)\nMeals and entertainment 66 5 2\nNondeductible penalties 3 6 3\nProvision to return filing adjustments 684 (352) 55\nTotal $ 3,728 $ 5,303 $ 4,810\n51\nDeferred income taxes recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2023 and 2022 consisted of the following:\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nAsset valuation allowances and accrued expenses $ 1,651 $ 2,257\nInventories 2,428 3,300\nState and local income taxes 305 293\nPension and deferred compensation 54 42\nNet operating losses 866 794\n163(J) Interest limitation 4,644 1,077\nLease asset 1,853 2,608\nTotal deferred tax assets 11,801 10,371\nValuation allowances (355) -\nTotal deferred tax assets 11,446 10,371\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFixed assets 4,166 4,490\nIntangible assets 11,713 10,262\nOther assets 748 793\nTollgate tax on Lifestyle earnings 228 228\nState and local income taxes 280 59\nLease Liability 1,786 2,545\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 18,921 18,377\nNet deferred tax liability $ 7,475 $ 8,006\nThe valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023 is related to certain foreign income tax net operating loss carry forwards.\nWe have provided Puerto Rico tollgate taxes on approximately $3.7 million of accumulated undistributed earnings of Lifestyle\nprior to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, that would be payable if such earnings were repatriated to the United States. In 2001,\nwe received abatement for Puerto Rico tollgate taxes on all earnings subsequent to June 30, 1994; thus no other provision for\ntollgate tax has been made on earnings after that date. If we repatriate the earnings from Lifestyle, $0.2 million of tollgate tax\nwould be due as of December 31, 2023.\nWe are subject to tax examinations in various taxing jurisdictions. The earliest exam years open for examination are as follows:\nEarliest Exam\nYear\nTaxing Authority Jurisdiction:\nU.S. Federal 2020\nVarious U.S. States 2019\nPuerto Rico (U.S. Territory) 2018\nCanada 2018\nChina 2020\nMexico 2021\nUnited Kingdom 2021\nAustralia 2021\nOur policy is to accrue interest and penalties on any uncertain tax position as a component of income tax expense. As of December\n31, 2023, no such expenses were recognized during the year. We do not believe there will be any material changes in our uncertain\ntax positions over the next 12 months.\nAccounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain\ntax positions recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements. Under this guidance, income tax positions must meet a more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of the standard. We did not have\nany unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n52\n14. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nRepurchase of Common Stock\nOur previous shareholder repurchase program expired on March 4, 2022.

REVENUE\nNature of Performance Obligations\nOur products are distributed through three distinct channels, which represent our business segments: Wholesale, Retail and\nContract Manufacturing. In our Wholesale business, we distribute our products through a wide range of distribution channels\nrepresenting over 10,000 retail store locations in the U.S., Canada, and internationally, mainly in Europe. Our Wholesale channels\nvary by product line and include sporting goods stores, outdoor specialty stores, online retailers, independent retailers, mass\nmerchants, retail uniform stores and specialty safety shoe stores. Our Retail business includes direct sales of our products to\nconsumers through our e-commerce websites, our Rocky Outdoor Gear Store, and Lehigh business. We also sell footwear under\nthe Rocky Brands label to the U.S. Military.\nSignificant Accounting Policies and Judgements\nRevenue is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied; this generally occurs upon\nshipment of our product to our customer, which is when the transfer of control of our product passes to the customer. The duration\nof our arrangements with our customers are typically one year or less. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we\nexpect to receive in exchange for the transfer of our products at a point in time and consists of either fixed or variable\nconsideration or a combination of both.\nRevenues from sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves\nare established. Components of variable consideration include prompt payment discounts, volume rebates and product returns.\nThese reserves, as detailed below, are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as\nreductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a\nparty other than a customer).\nThe amount of variable consideration which is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net\nsales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized\nunder the contract will not occur in a future period. Our analyses also contemplated application of the constraint in accordance\nwith the guidance, under which it determined a material reversal of revenue would not occur in a future period for the estimates\nas of December 31, 2023. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in\nthe future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net revenue and earnings in the period\nsuch variances become known.\nWhen a customer has a right to a prompt payment discount, we estimate the likelihood that the customer will earn the discount\nusing historical data and adjust our estimate when the estimate of the likelihood that a customer will earn the discount changes\nor the consideration becomes fixed, whichever occurs earlier. The estimated amount of variable consideration is recognized as a\ncredit to trade receivables and a reduction in revenue until the uncertainty of the variable consideration is alleviated. Because\nmost of our customers have payment terms less than six months there is not a significant financing component in our contracts\nwith customers.\nWhen a customer is offered a rebate on purchases retroactively, this is accounted for as variable consideration because the\nconsideration for the current and past purchases is not fixed until it is known if the discount is earned. We estimate the expected\ndiscount the customer will earn at contract inception using historical data and projections and update our estimates when\nprojections materially change or consideration becomes fixed. The estimated rebate is recognized as a credit to trade receivables\nand offset against revenue until the rebate is earned or the earning period has lapsed.\nWhen a right of return is part of the arrangement with the customer, we estimate the expected returns based on an analysis using\nhistorical data. We adjust our estimate either when the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive changes or when\nthe consideration becomes fixed, whichever occurs earlier. Please see Note 1 and Note 6 for additional information.\nTrade receivables represent our right to unconditional payment that only relies on the passage of time.\nContract receivables represent contractual minimum payments required under non-cancellable contracts with the U.S. Military\nand other customers with a duration of one year or less.\nContract liabilities are performance obligations that we expect to satisfy or relieve within the next twelve months, advance\nconsideration obtained prior to satisfying a performance obligation, or unconditional obligations to provide goods or services\nunder non-cancellable contracts before the transfer of goods or services to the customer has occurred. Our contract liability\nrepresents unconditional obligations to provide goods under non-cancellable contracts with the U.S. Military and other customers.\n55\nItems considered immaterial within the context of the contract are recognized as an expense.\nTaxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing\ntransaction, that are collected from customers, are excluded from revenue.\nCosts associated with our manufacturer’s warranty continue to be recognized as expense when the products are sold in accordance\nwith guidance surrounding product warranties.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are\naccounted for as a fulfillment cost and are in included in operating expenses. This treatment is consistent with how we accounted\nfor these costs in prior periods.\nCosts associated with obtaining a contract are expensed as incurred in accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 340-40 in\ninstances where the amortization period is one year or less. We anticipate substantially all costs incurred to obtain a contract\nwould be subject to this practical expedient.\nContract Liabilities\nThe following table provides information about contract liabilities from contracts with our customers.\nDecember 31, December 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nContract liabilities $ 927 $ -\nSignificant changes in the contract liabilities balance during the period are as follows:\nContract\n($ in thousands) liabilities\nBalance, December 31, 2022 -\nNon-cancelable contracts with customers entered into during the period $ 2,990\nRevenue recognized related to non-cancelable contracts with customers during the period (2,063)\nBalance, December 31, 2023 $ 927\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nAll revenues are recognized at a point in time when control of our products pass to the customer at point of shipment. Because\nall revenues are recognized at a point in time and are disaggregated by channel, our segment disclosures are consistent with ASC\n606 disaggregation requirements. See Note 19 for segment disclosures.\n18.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nReportable Segments - We have identified three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail and Contract Manufacturing.\nWholesale. In our Wholesale segment, our products are offered in over 10,000 retail locations representing a wide range of\ndistribution channels in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and other international markets, mainly in Europe. These distribution channels\nvary by product line and target market and include sporting goods stores, outdoor retailers, independent shoe retailers, hardware\nstores, catalogs, mass merchants, uniform stores, farm store chains, specialty safety stores, specialty retailers and online retailers.\nRetail. In our Retail segment, we market directly to consumers through our Lehigh business-to-business including direct sales\nand through our CustomFit websites, consumer e-commerce websites, third-party marketplaces, and our Rocky Outdoor\nGear Store. Through our outdoor gear store, we generally sell first quality or discontinued products in addition to a limited\namount of factory damaged goods, which typically carry lower gross margins.\nContract Manufacturing. In our Contract Manufacturing segment, we include sales to the U.S. Military, private label sales and\nany sales to customers in which we are contracted to manufacture or source a specific footwear product for a customer.\nThe following is a summary of segment results for the Wholesale, Retail, and Contract Manufacturing segments for the years\nended December 31:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nNET SALES:\nWholesale $ 337,019 $ 484,779 $ 391,070\nRetail 116,960 115,354 94,658\nContract Manufacturing 7,854 15,342 28,499\nTotal Net Sales $ 461,833 $ 615,475 $ 514,227\nGROSS MARGIN:\nWholesale $ 119,485 $ 165,059 $ 140,166\nRetail 58,391 57,817 47,792\nContract Manufacturing 722 2,343 6,578\nTotal Gross Margin $ 178,598 $ 225,219 $ 194,536\nSegment asset information is not prepared or used to assess segment performance.\nProduct Group Information - The following is supplemental information on net sales by product group for the years ended\nDecember 31:\n% of % of % of\n($ in thousands) 2023 Sales 2022 Sales 2021 Sales\nWork footwear $ 198,096 42.9 % $ 256,162 41.6% $ 280,235 54.5%\nOutdoor footwear 130,424 28.2 183,121 29.8 76,031 14.8\nWestern 70,374 15.2 108,697 17.7 87,425 17.0\nDuty and commercial military footwear 50,482 10.9 46,177 7.5 39,715 7.7\nMilitary footwear 7,999 1.7 15,342 2.5 22,767 4.4\nOther 3,103 0.7 3,581 0.6 5,149 1.0\nApparel 1,355 0.3 2,395 0.4 2,905 0.6\n$ 461,833 100.0 % $ 615,475 100.0% $ 514,227 100.0%\nNet sales to foreign countries represented approximately 5.1% of net sales in 2023, 6.2% of net sales in 2022 and 6.9% of net\nsales in 2021.\nThe net book value of fixed assets located outside of the U.S. totaled $11.9 million at December 31, 2023, of which\napproximately $3.9 million resides in the Dominican Republic and approximately $8.0 million resides in China.\n57\n20. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nIn 2023, we completed a cost savings review aimed at operating efficiencies to better position us for profitable growth. Following\nthe integration of the Acquired Brands, we identified a number of operational synergies and cost savings opportunities, including\na reduction in workforce. In addition to the accrued expenses below, we incurred approximately $1.5 million in restructuring\ncosts that are included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, the following activity was recorded:\nEmployee Severance, Benefits\nand Related Costs\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nAccrued expenses, beginning of period $ 381 -\nRestructuring charges 1,486 $ 1,201\nCash payments (885) (820)\nAccrued expenses, end of period $ 982 $ 381\n21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe are, from time to time, a party to litigation which arises in the normal course of business. Although the ultimate resolution\nof pending proceedings cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, the resolution of such proceedings in the aggregate\nwill not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nLitigation\nWe are currently party to litigation with a manufacturing supplier of the Acquired Brands. While it is not possible to predict the\noutcome of this litigation with certainty, we do not anticipate the resolution will have a material, adverse impact on our financial\nposition. We believe that the likelihood of the resolution being materially adverse to our financial statements is remote and as\nsuch have not recorded any contingent liabilities within the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we\nhave not recorded any potential favorable resolution to the litigation due in accordance with ASC 450-30, Gain Contingencies.\nGain Contingency\nIn June 2022, we became aware of a misclassification of Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes filed with the U.S. Customs\nand Border Protection (U.S. Customs) on certain products imported into the U.S. associated with the Acquired Brands during\n2021 and 2022. As a result of the misclassification of HTS codes we have paid duties in excess of the required amount. We are\nin the process of filing multiple post summary corrections with U.S. Customs to seek refunds of duties paid in excess of the\ncorrect HTS codes. We have the potential to recover the total amount of overpaid duties resulting in a potential refund of\napproximately $7.7 million, of which we have received $1.9 million in refunds during the year ended December 31, 2023 and\n$3.2 million in refunds during the year ended December 31, 2022. We are accounting for these post summary corrections as a\ngain contingency, and as such have not recorded these potential refunds within the accompanying unaudited condensed\nconsolidated balance sheet due to uncertainty of collection. Refunds received will be recognized as a reduction to the cost of\ngoods sold when, and if, the refunds are received.\n58\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nDISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, with the participation of our\nprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as\ndefined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon\nthat evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. It should be noted that the design of any system of\ncontrols is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any\ndesign will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)\npromulgated under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely\nto materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have made the necessary and appropriate updates to our\ninternal controls as it relates to financial reporting over our Acquired Brands, none of which were material.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term\nis defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting\nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk\nthat controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (COSO) as of December 31, 2023. The scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting includes all of our businesses. Based upon that evaluation under the framework in Internal\nControl – Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was\neffective as of December 31, 2023. Schneider Downs & Co., Inc., our independent registered public accounting firm has issued\nan attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting which is included within this report.\n59\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of\nRocky Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNelsonville, Ohio\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Rocky Brands, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ (the \"Company’s\") internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated\nFramework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the balance sheets and the related statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows\nof the Company, and our report dated March 15, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report\non Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control\nover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Schneider Downs & Co., Inc.\nColumbus, Ohio\nMarch 15, 2024\n60\nITEM 9B.
