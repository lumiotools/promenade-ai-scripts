(Operator Instructions)I would now like to pass the conference over to your\nhost, Jocelyn Kukulka, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may proceed, Jocelyn.\nJocelyn Kukulka\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for TCBI's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm\nJocelyn Kukulka, Head of Investor Relations.\nBefore we begin, please be aware this call will include forward-looking statements that are based on our\ncurrent expectations of future results or events. Forward-looking statements are subject to both known\nand unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these\nstatements. Our forward-looking statements are as of the date of this call, and we do not assume any\nobligation to update or revise them.\nStatements made on this call should be considered together with the cautionary statements and other\ninformation contained in today's earnings release, our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and\nsubsequent filings with the SEC. We will refer to slides during today's presentation, which can be found\nalong with the press release in the Investor Relations section of our website at texascapitalbank.com. Our\nspeakers for the call today are Rob Holmes, President and CEO; and Matt Scurlock, CFO. At the\nconclusion of our prepared remarks, our operator will open up the call for Q&A.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Rob for opening remarks.\nRob Holmes\nThank you for joining us today.\nThis quarter marks three years since the announcement of our strategic plan in September of 2021. Our\ncollective and deliberate actions over the last several years, including those announced last month,\ncontinue to establish our Firm as worthy of serving the best clients in our markets, with superior product\nbreadth and banker execution, increasingly resulting in high-quality financial outcomes we believed the\nmodel would ultimately be capable of producing.\nOn an adjusted basis, this quarter featured record performance across a variety of important financial\nmetrics. Quarterly return on average assets of 1.00%, return on common equity of 10%, pre-provision net\nrevenue of $115 million, fee income of $64.8 million, and earnings per share of $1.59 all reached record\nlevels since the beginning of the transformation, while investment banking, trading income and tangible\nbook value per share reached the highest levels in Firm history. With unquestioned market momentum,\nan increasingly complete and differentiated platform, and robust capital and liquidity, we are well-\npositioned to execute throughout 2025.\n2\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nSustained multi-year growth in our fee income areas of focus continued again this quarter, as Treasury\nProduct Fees, Wealth Management Fees, and Investment Banking and Trading Income delivered $54\nmillion in non-interest revenue, up 25% linked quarter, and 32% year over year. This is the second\nconsecutive record quarter since the beginning of the transformation, as year-to-date adjusted total non-\ninterest income is 19% of adjusted total revenue, firmly within our target range for fee income contribution\nfor full year 2025.\nThis fee income realization is simply a market facing indicator of the increased frequency and quality of\nclient solutions being delivered across our platform. Investment Banking and Trading Income increased\n32% quarter over quarter to a record of $40.5 million led by Syndications, Capital Markets, and Sales &\nTrading. Our syndication business executed a record number of transactions in the quarter, placing us 8th\nin the middle market league tables nationwide, as our distinct capabilities enabled clients to access bank\nfunding in what was still a tight market. We also continue to differentiate by facilitating client access to\nnon-bank financing, with Capital Markets delivering records this quarter in both fees and transaction\nvolumes. The investment banking platform, while still maturing in both product offerings and execution\ncapabilities, is building a base of consistent and repeatable revenues that will be both a differentiator in\nthe marketplace and a meaningful contributor to future earnings.\nThe Treasury Solutions platform, which provides both payment products and services in parity with the\nmajor money center banks, with a differentiated client journey, which is faster and more efficient, is\nincreasingly realizing growth in stable and recurring revenue resulting from three years of significant\ninvestment. Client and product onboarding continues on pace with expectations, as year over year\nTreasury Product Fees increased 16% led by a 10% increase in gross payment revenues year to date.\nThis is now 6 consecutive quarters of year over year growth exceeding three times that experienced by\nthe industry.\nThe full rebuild of the Private Wealth business, which will be completed by year end, includes an entirely\nnew operating platform, along with significantly enhanced products and services, and is providing early\nsigns of increased client adoption with wealth related fees increasing 9% this quarter. The materially\nenhanced client journey should enable improved connectivity to the rest of our platform, allowing for\naccelerated client adoption moving into 2025 and significant future scale.\nAs discussed for multiple quarters, while our platform breadth is enabling new client acquisition at a pace\nconsistent with internal expectations, with year-to-date new relationships onboarded now over 110% of\nnew relationships for full year 2023, lower system-wide client demand for bank credit has limited\nimmediate earning asset expansion.\nWe were, however, able to again leverage our disciplined capital allocation process this quarter to\nsupport continued buildout of our industry focused Corporate Banking platform by acquiring a portfolio of\napproximately $400 million in committed exposure to companies in the healthcare sector. Texas Capital\nhas significant institutional knowledge of many of the companies in the portfolio, which importantly, are\nsupported by sector-focused sponsors with notable track records of value creation. These clients will\nbenefit from an extensive solutions-focused platform, with revenue cycle management, healthcare asset-\nbased lending, and other sector-specific products integrated with differentiated cash management,\ncommercial banking and investment banking capabilities.\nThe multi-quarter trend of clients increasingly leveraging our distinct cash management capabilities\ncontinued this quarter, with non-brokered interest-bearing deposits now up 24%, or $3.1 billion year-over-\nyear. Importantly, non-interest-bearing deposits, excluding Mortgage Finance, increased 4% to $3.4\n3\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nbillion this quarter as our sustained focus on earning the right to become our clients’ primary operating\nbank is having the anticipated balance sheet impact.\nIn addition to noted financial performance, we remain focused on our consistently stated objective of\nfinancial resilience, the Firm finished the quarter with Tangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets of\n9.65%, ranked first amongst the largest banks in the country, a reserve ratio of 1.87%, excluding\nmortgage finance loans, which is top decile amongst our peer group, and liquid assets of 27%, above\npeer medians.\nOur commitment to achieving improved financial performance is unwavering and our position of\nunprecedented strength is enabling us to serve clients in our markets who seek a financial partner to\nsupport them through all stages of their business or personal lifecycle. We will drive attractive, thru-cycle\nshareholder returns, with both higher quality earnings and a lower cost of capital, as we ramp high value\nbusinesses through increased client adoption, improved client journeys, and realized operational\nefficiencies – all objectives that we made significant headway on year to date with roadmaps to\naccelerate scale in 2025.\nFinally, I want to acknowledge the dedication of our employees who execute this strategy every single\nday and are the unquestioned driving force behind the continued success of the Firm.\nNow I’ll turn it over to Matt for the financials results.\nMatt Scurlock\nThanks, Rob, and good morning.\nStarting on slide 5 - Total adjusted revenue increased $38 million, or 14% for the quarter to $305 million\nas a $23.5 million increase in net interest income was augmented by a $14.4 million, or 29% linked\nquarter increase in non-interest revenue. The $64.8 million of fee income delivered this quarter is the\nhigh-water mark since we began the transformation in January of 2021, and our YTD adjusted non-\ninterest revenue of $157 million is more than double the amount delivered in full-year 2020 when\nnormalizing warehouse related fees and adjusting for businesses we’ve sold or wound down.\nQuarterly total adjusted non-interest expense increased 1% linked quarter as expected growth in\noccupancy, and communications & technology expense was partially offset by a reduction in salaries and\nbenefits related costs.\nTaken together, linked quarter adjusted PPNR increased 45% to $115 million. This marks the resumption\nof quarterly operating leverage against the comparable quarter in the prior year, achieved a quarter\nearlier than indicated during the July earnings call.\nThe modest reduction in this quarter’s provision expense to $10 million resulted from slowing charge-offs,\nand moderate loan growth, partially offset by a sustained conservative posture related to our economic\noutlook. Year-to-date provision expense as a percentage of average LHI excluding mortgage finance is\nwithin our through-cycle range at 39 bps annualized.\nNet income to common when including the realization of losses associated with the AFS bond portfolio\nrepositioning and certain non-recurring items was negative $65.6 million, while adjusted net income to\n4\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\ncommon was $74.3 million, up $36.6 million or 97% linked quarter. The tax rate for the quarter decreased\nto 23.3% and we expect the full year tax rate to be around 34%.\nOur balance sheet positioning remains exceptionally strong with ending period cash balances of 13% of\ntotal assets and cash and securities of 27%, both higher this quarter and in line with year-end targeted\nratios. Ending period gross LHI balances increased by approximately $522 million, or 2% linked quarter,\ndriven primarily by slightly higher than anticipated seasonal growth in the Mortgage Finance business and\nthe acquisition of a C&I healthcare loan portfolio which closed at quarter end with funded balances of\napproximately $330 million.\nTotal deposits increased by $2 billion or 9% during the quarter, with gains in both commercial non-interest\nbearing and interest bearing accounts. This core client growth should support continued proactive\nreductions of our highest cost deposits where we have limited additional product touchpoints elsewhere\non the platform, while also supporting a multi-quarter low loan to deposit ratio of 86%.\nAOCI improved by $240mm or 65% linked quarter related to both the bond repositioning and the 80bps\ndecline in 5-year Treasury rates during the period.\nTotal gross LHI excluding mortgage finance was relatively flat linked quarter, increasing a modest $71\nmillion, as limited credit demand experienced over the last 12 months and now increasing commercial\nreal estate payoffs suppress loan volumes across the industry.\nCommercial loans grew $434 million this quarter, inclusive of the $330 million loan portfolio acquisition\nthat Rob detailed, and is up $602 million, or 6% year-over-year. Our expectation that the sustained pace\nof new client acquisition would result in modest balance sheet and loan growth this year is occurring,\nalthough at a slower pace than contemplated in our original 2024 guidance.\nCommercial real estate period end balances decreased $374 million, or 7% in the quarter, as payoff rates\ncontinue to be elevated and current and trailing 18-month origination limited given the market backdrop.\n$80 million of the decline resulted from payoffs in the office portfolio which now comprises just 2% of total\nloans. Overall, the real estate portfolio remains weighted to multifamily, which is $2.3 billion or 44% of\noutstanding balances, reflecting both our deep experience in the space and observed performance\nthrough credit and interest rate cycles.\nAnticipated seasonal growth in Mortgage Finance was augmented by the reduction in 30-year mortgage\nrates experienced from early-August through mid- September, resulting in a linked quarter increase in\naverage mortgage finance loans of $795 million, or 18%, to $5.2 billion. Given ongoing rate volatility, we\nremain cautious on the outlook, with now full-year expectations for a year over year increase in average\nwarehouse volumes of 10% to $4.5 billion supported by mortgage rates near 6.40% during the fourth\nquarter.\nEnding period deposit balances increased 9% quarter-over-quarter, and $1.1bn or 6% when excluding\nthe seasonally elevated contribution of Mortgage Finance. Sustained success in attracting quality funding\nassociated with our core offerings enabled growth in commercial client non-interest bearing deposits of\n4% linked quarter while brokered deposits remain at a 10-year low comprising approximately 2% of total\ndeposits. This positive trend will continue to support over the coming quarters selective reduction of the\nhighest cost deposits where we are unable to earn additional business necessary to generate an\nappropriate return on capital.\n5\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nAverage mortgage finance deposits were 116% of average mortgage finance loans, a slight decline\nquarter over quarter and consistent with our guidance. We expect the ratio of average mortgage finance\ndeposits to average mortgage finance loans to decline to 110% in the fourth quarter as the predictable\nchanges in client deposits should match anticipated warehouse fundings. As a reminder, there is\nseasonality in these deposits as annual tax payments begin remittance out of escrow accounts in the\nsecond half of the fourth quarter which continues through January.\nAs detailed in previous calls, select mortgage finance deposits feature relationship pricing credits which\nare applied to both clients mortgage finance and commercial loans based on each loan type’s contribution\nto interest income during the quarter. Attribution of interest credits are expected to follow a similar\ndistribution for the duration of the year with approximately 60% associated with mortgage finance, and\n40% aligned to commercial loans to mortgage finance clients.\nEnding period non-interest bearing deposits excluding mortgage finance remain 13% of total deposits,\nand our expectation is that this percentage remains relatively stable in the near-term.\nOur modeled earnings at risk increased slightly in the quarter as adjustments to the balance sheet\ncomposition resulted in marginally less forward downside rate protection, but potentially higher levels of\nabsolute net interest income. The full impact of the 49bps decline in SOFR during the quarter resulted\nfrom our largely variable rate loan portfolio repricing down in advance of the Fed’s move in late\nSeptember. The timing of deposit repricing activities are more closely aligned to actual changes in\nFederal Funds rates and we expect our initial repricing efforts to be realized by mid-October and are\ntherefore only partially reflected in the net interest income sensitivity disclosures.\nIn August the firm continued the multi-year process of effectively rationalizing the legacy balance sheet,\nselling approximately $1.24 billion of available-for-sale securities with an average book yield of 1.23%,\npurchased prior to 2021. Cash proceeds from the sale were used to purchase $1.06 billion of securities at\na yield of 5.26%, which is expected to contribute an incremental $35 to $40 million in net interest income\non an annualized basis.\nWe do anticipate continued reinvestment over the duration of the year which will improve securities yield\nwhile maintaining rate positioning.\nNet interest margin expanded by 15 basis points in the quarter, and net interest income increased to\n$240.1 million. Quarterly net interest income benefitted from the impacts of balance sheet repositioning\ninto higher earnings assets associated with our long-term strategy and quarterly improvements in both\nMortgage Finance volumes and yields supported by the lower self-funding ratio.\nAs industry wide asset quality normalization continues so does our multi-year posture of prudently\nbuilding the reserve to effectively address communicated legacy credits and buffer against the potential\nimpact of an uncertain economic outlook. The total allowance for credit loss including off balance sheet\nreserves increased $6.5 million on a linked quarter basis to $319 million, up $28 million year-over-year,\nwhich when excluding Mortgage Finance is 1.87% of total LHI, a high since the adoption of CECL in\n2020.\nCriticized loans increased slightly to 4.0% of total LHI, as a decrease in special mention was offset by\nmodest migration of a diversified set of credits within both the commercial real estate and the commercial\nloan portfolios into substandard. The period end composition of criticized loans remains weighted towards\ncommercial clients with dependencies on consumer discretionary income as well as well-structured\ncommercial real estate loans supported by strong sponsors.\n6\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nNet charge-offs of $6.1 million, or 0.11% of average LHI, were comprised of a small number of\ncommercial credits. Our identified legacy problem credits have now been reduced through resolution,\nworkouts and payoffs to approximately $16 million, down from $200 million at the end of 2020.\nConsistent with prior quarters, capital levels remain at or near the top of the industry.\nTotal regulatory capital remains exceptionally strong relative to both the peer group and our internally\nassessed risk profile. CET1 finished the quarter at 11.19%, a 43 bps decrease from prior quarter related\nthe securities repositioning, and increased risk weighted assets from quarterly loan growth.\nTangible common equity to tangible assets finished at 9.65%, which continues to be ranked first amongst\nthe largest banks in the country while tangible book value per share increased 14.3% year over year to\n$66.06, a record level for the firm.\nOur guidance accounts for the market-based forward rate curve, which as of October 4th, implied 50 bps\nof additional reduction to Federal Funds Rate in November, followed by a 25 bps cut in December to\nfinish the year at 4.25% which is a 100 bps decline since our last earnings call in July.\nGiven the significant change in near-term rate outlook, we are modestly reducing our revenue guidance to\nlow single digit growth for the full-year.\nNon-interest expense guidance of approximately $765 million contemplates the actions taken in\nSeptember.\nAs shown again this quarter, we continue to effectively deploy capital in excess of our 11% CET1\nminimum in support of published strategic objectives. Near-term capital priorities remain focused on\ngrowing the core business, improving future earnings generation, and increasing tangible book value per\nshare, all areas where we continue to show material progress.\nQuarterly increases in year over year PPNR growth should continue in Q4 2024, and for the duration of\n2025.\nFinally, while we maintain our conservative outlook we are reducing our annual provision expense\nguidance to 40bps from 50bps of average LHI excluding Mortgage Finance given both recent balance\nsheet and credit migration trends.\nMoving to 2025, based on the economic and rate outlook as of October 4th, multi-year investments in\ninfrastructure, data, and process improvements should continue yielding expected operating and financial\nefficiencies enabling targeted additional investment in talent and capabilities. Our current outlook with\nplanned initiatives and expected revenue for full-year 2025 suggests non-interest expense of\napproximately $765 – $770 million.\nInternal estimates against that economic backdrop also contemplate continued industry-leading client\nadoption and associated growth in our fee income areas of focus, with full-year targeted 2025 total non-\ninterest revenue reaching $240 million.\nGiven our focus on leveraging the Firm’s broad platform to serve clients based on their unique needs,\nbalance sheet expansion, mix, and associated net interest income generation, remain the most difficult to\nestimate due to the dynamic macroeconomic and political backdrop. The market rate outlook as of early\nOctober incorporated rapid decreases in short-term rates over the next 9 months, with Fed Funds exiting\nthe year at 4.25% and ultimately reaching 3.50% by June. In this outlook, as short-term rates come down,\n7\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nthe curve flattens significantly with the 10-year declining to 3.92% in December of this year then troughing\naround 3.80% in June next year.\nInternal estimates in that rate environment suggest the potential for high-single to low double digit full-\nyear average loan growth, with deposit repricing accelerating by the second half of next year, enabling\nhigh single digit net interest income growth. Given 80% of our current loan portfolio is tied to the short end\nof the curve, both a slower pace of reductions, and / or a higher terminal value should improve 2025 Net\nInterest Income generation.\nAfter three years of aggressively building the reserve to reflect our consistently conservative posture, the\nnear-term provision outlook has potential to move towards 30-35 bps of average LHI, excluding Mortgage\nFinance in 2025, more closely resembling trailing charge-off rates while preserving industry leading\ncoverage levels.\nTaken together, this outlook suggests achievement of 1.1% ROAA in the back half of next year, with\npotential for higher levels should the pace and magnitude of anticipated cuts moderate.\nOperator – we’d now like to open the call up for questions. Thank you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) We have the first question today from Woody Lay with KBW.\nWoody Lay\nWanted to start on the loan growth strategy and more specifically loan purchases. The healthcare\npurchase helped sort of stabilized growth in the quarter. Do you think we could see additional loan\npurchases from here?\nJust trying to get a gauge on the strategy there.\nRob Holmes\nHey Woody, it’s Rob. I’ll take that. So I wouldn’t consider this a loan purchase, if you will. We had\nonboarded a number of bankers from a financial firm that had relationships tied to those loans, and we’re\nable to acquire the loans and the relationships that come with those, some immediate and some over\ntime. And we have a much more robust platform so that we can do many more things with those same\nclients and sponsors, thus being more relevant to them and driving a much greater return.\nThe loan purchase was a result of the strategic efforts, if you will. I mean to give you an example, I have\npersonally already flown and met with the owners of over 80% of the companies that make up those\nloans. So we are not buying loan portfolios for loan growth or stabilization of loans whatsoever.\nWe’ve onboarded this year 110% of the same number of clients that we onboard at the same time last\nyear. At some point, those clients will need to borrow and they can either borrow from our balance sheet\n8\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nor we can raise third-party capital like we’re very good at doing now with a record number of transactions\nand volume this year. We’re agnostic to how we solve our clients’ needs, and we advise them to solve\nthose needs based on the best outcome for them.\nBut loan growth will certainly come. It has to with the amount of market share that we’re taking and the\namount of primary relationships that we’re onboarding. Like you don’t grow PxV in mid to high teens for\nthree years without becoming the primary operating bank for those clients. So you have a primary\noperating bank, you’re talking to them more regularly on a regular basis. Investor talked to them about\ncapital needs on a more frequent basis. We’re not really concerned about loan growth as a relative matter\nto the industry whatsoever.\nMatt Scurlock\nThe only thing I’d add on that, Woody, is that the reason why we generally give CET1 guidance as\nopposed to loan growth guidance or buyback specific guidance that the way we’re going to deploy capital\nis somewhat dynamic depending on opportunities we have to either fulfill the strategy and/or improve\ntangible book value. So this is simply an action consistent with the capital menu that we’ve been pretty\ndisciplined in leveraging across the last three years.\nWoody Lay\nYes. It’s good to hear the optimism on the loan growth front.\nGrowth in the industry has been weaker this quarter. Does it feel like there’s sort of a clearing event to get\nloan growth to ramp back up? Is it -- as you talk to clients, are they kind of waiting through the election?\nOr just any color on when you expect it to ramp up?\nRob Holmes\nLook, the only thing I would say is we cover from business banking, which will -- with our pipelines, I\nbelieve we’re a top five SBA lender to Business Banking in the very near term. That business is coming\nout of the ground, middle market banking, corporate banking. As you know we have different segments in\ncorporate banking TMT, healthcare, FIG, diversified, energy, et cetera.\nWe do see more demand and loan growth in certain segments of that than others. The great thing is we\ncover the entirety with expertise and different products and services for each. I’m not going to predict loan\ngrowth whatsoever. But I would just say what I said before, we’re agnostic to whether they borrow from\nus, or we place private credit or raise institutional debt.\nBut we certainly anticipate with our market share gains that when loan growth does come back in the\neconomy, we’ll certainly benefit from that.\n9\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nWoody Lay\nGot it.\nThen maybe just shifting over to the investment banking side. It was a really strong quarter for you all.\nJust any additional granularity you could provide on sort of what drove the investment banking income in\nthe third quarter?\nRob Holmes\nI’ll start, and then maybe Matt can do the number thing. I would just say it’s exciting to the Investment\nBank. Remember, we didn’t build the investment bank for a different set of clients than the commercial\nbank or corporate bank or private bank in the same group of clients. It’s one way to provide solutions to\ntheir very specific needs. My point is it’s a group effort from the entirety of the firm to have record earnings\nin the investment bank.\nHaving said that, the thing that’s most rewarding, if you will, on the investment banking side is it came\nfrom syndications. Which we’re a top eight arranger of middle-market bank debt in the entirety of the U.S.\nIt came from record volumes and fees in capital markets. It came from sales and trading and all different\npockets of sales and trading, not just mortgage.\nIt is a universally increasing source of repeatable and recurring revenues at a much more granular level\nnow. We did do a big deal, but that’s not the entirety of why we had a record quarter. We’re really excited\nabout the investment bank and what it is today but also what it can be.\nRemember, there’s still a lot of pockets in investment banking, we have the entirety of the expense base\nconsumed into the platform. For an example, public finance. We built sales and trading on the back of\nmortgage trading, which we built on the back of mortgage warehouse. Risk, appliance controls, process\nprocedures, the people to run it, et cetera, technology. All those investments were already within the\nplatform.\nThen we also had a government not-for-profit business covering schools, towns, municipalities, and alike\nthat our consumer is a public finance. All you do is you add the sales and traders for underwriting this\ndebt with very little expense. Then on the C&I side, you’ve got more things you can offer to the clients\nyou’re already covering.\nIt’s a revenue synergy and it’s an expense synergy. We have that across the entirety of the platform with\na lot of earnings potential to move forward. I don’t see the investment bank going backwards. It’s not\ngoing to be a straight linear up, but the strategy is proven, the clients hire us. I think we’re growing\ninvestment banking fees at a faster rate than any firm certainly over the same period that we’ve been\ndoing this.\n10\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nMatt Scurlock\nYes. I think the record fee quarter Woody, isn’t just isolated to the investment bank. The $54 million that\nwe delivered in the income areas of focus, which are treasury, private wealth, and investment banking,\nthat’s 13% more this quarter than we delivered for full year 2020. So really strong performance across the\nboard in all those areas that we’ve invested in heavily since Rob’s arrival.\nWe do call out in the slides and worth noting here that after two consecutive record quarters in the\ninvestment bank, you are likely to see a modest pullback in the fourth quarter as pipelines rebuild in\npursuit of the noninterest income levels that we gave you for full year 2025. I’d look for the fourth quarter\nin IB to be around $20 million to $25 million, which should pull fees somewhere into the $45 million to $50\nmillion range for the fourth quarter.\nOperator\nWe will now move on to the next question. We have Ben Gerlinger with Citi.\nBenjamin Gerlinger\nIt seems like you’ve made progress. I get that it’s a bit of a coiled spring here. But when you guys look at\n‘25, just kind of what assumption are you guys using on mortgage warehouse or the NIM?\nI get every quarter is going to be different based on the seasonality and just kind of look at just going\nforward, it seems like you’ve cleaned that up quite a bit behind the scene. Just any sort of numbers would\nbe helpful.\nMatt Scurlock\nYes. Feel free to title your research note the coiled spring. I’m not sure that’s been used yet. Ben, we\ngave a ton of insight into our view for 2025.\nI don’t know that we’re going to get a lot more detail on individual yields that are potentially 12 months in\nfront of us. I will talk to a bit just about the rate curve because to your point, it does have a pretty\nsignificant impact both on balance sheet volumes and on yield as you move into 2025. The curve that we\nuse is we’re incredibly specific on the date given how much it’s been moving was as of early October, so\nOctober 4th to be specific.\nIt exits the year with Fed funds at 4.25%. Fed funds moves down to about 3.50% in June. Then the 10-\nyear, which is going to be most closely correlated with mortgage finance volumes exit this year at about\n3.9% and then sits at about 3.8% midyear. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the curve starts to\nflatten. In that environment, we think net interest income picks up high single digits. So that, coupled with\n$240 million of fee-based revenue and $765 million to $770 million of noninterest expense is where our\ninternal view suggests drives 1.10% sometimes to back in the next year.\n11\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nBenjamin Gerlinger\nGot you. Okay. So you’re looking at a quarterly 1.10%, kind of a run rate by the end of ‘25, is that also -- I\nmean to get more of the ROTCE number, how do you presume buybacks? Or -- I mean capital\ndeployment, obviously is better for loan growth or usage for revenue production. I get that it’s a strong\nstrategy.\nBut does this mean you’re going to completely stop buying back stock? Or just kind of how you approach\ncapital deployment, assuming there’s not a lot of activity kind of in the fourth quarter here. It seems like\nthings might slow down a little bit temporarily.\nMatt Scurlock\nYes. Our capital priorities then haven’t really changed. I mean I think the actions this quarter, we pulled\nabout every single lever that a management team can pull over the last 12 months. I think we’re pretty\npleased that the stock price makes buybacks marginally less appealing at this point at levels where we\nrepurchased over the previous few years, but we’ll evaluate forward buybacks the same way we have\nsince Rob’s arrival.\nIf we think about prioritization of different performance metrics, ROA has been one that’s increasing in\nrelevance for us since we made the determination that we were unwilling to push CET1 levels down to\nthe 9% to 10% that was incorporated in the original September 1st [2021] strategic plan.\nOur view is that financial resilience, which was a foundation of the company has only increased in\nimportance post the events of last spring. So we’re likely to keep CET1 around that 11% number. We’re\nreally focused on generating the right level of PPNR to average assets in a 1.10% ROA. The rate\nenvironment I just described, I think is one that’s fairly punitive.\nShould we not experience as many rate cuts and/or those rate cuts occur at a slower pace, that’s net\naccretive to 2025 ROA. So our commitment to you guys as we would get to this quarter and start to lay\nout in detail our internal view of 2025 financials, and we hope that we’ve done that for you.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) We now have the next question from Matt Olney with Stephens.\nMatt Olney\nAppreciate all the forward outlooks here. Most of my stuff has been addressed. But I also just want to ask\nabout the impact of the hedges I think you disclosed the hedge impact this quarter was $18 million drag.\nJust trying to appreciate the impact of the hedge as the notional balances come down as the Fed starts to\ncut overnight, and kind of what you’re assuming within that ‘25 guidance?\n12\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nMatt Scurlock\nYes. Great question, Matt. We hope that we improved the disclosure for you in the earnings presentation.\nThe slide that we generally talk about NII sensitivity, the bottom left, we’ve now depicted both the\nmaturities and the associated receive rates. The majority of those are tied to SOFR. There are some\nprime swaps. The majority are tied to SOFR.\nYou can follow the spot surfer curve if you’re choosing to make the determination of the pickup in terms of\nreceived fix moving back to float. The first big slug of maturities is in the second quarter. Current spot\nSOFR is around 3.40% in that period with a receive rate of 3%. We pick up about 40 basis points as\nthose swaps ultimately expire.\nThen the balance sheet positioning in general, the curve is not particularly conducive to adding any\nadditional downside rate protection at this point. So you will likely not see us reinvest cash flows in the\nbond portfolio recent purchases have been around 4.50% or so. We’d expect about $120 million a quarter\ngiven current rates.\nMatt Olney\nOkay. Great color, and I’ll go back and look at that updated disclosure. Thanks for including that.\nThen just lastly, on expenses. You’ve given us a good kind of outlook here for the fourth quarter and for\nnext year. It sounds like for the most part, the infrastructure has been built out.\nBut you also talk about technology and how that’s really should improve the operating leverage for the\ncompany. Any more color on kind of the technology you’re using and how you’re able to kind of effectively\nkeep expense levels flat next year?\nRob Holmes\nYes. There’s a really long answer. But in short, we have a persistent funding model and technology where\nwe’re investing a prescribed amount of money every year and change the bank while we try to be more\nefficient with how we run the bank.\nAs you know with our expense reductions and efficiencies that we’ve taken in the third quarter of this\nyear, first quarter of last year and at other points in time, we do have a proficiency in reimagining our\noperations and eliminating or digitizing certain actions so that we take out expense, but more importantly\nor just as importantly, we reduce operating risk. We have over 30% of our tech spend on our own\nengineers, where we’re really focused on client journeys.\nTake an INITIO, there’s no way in the world we could have grown PxV 14% to 17% year-over-year every\nquarter for a long time now without INITIO, which is an improved client journey, which reduces the time\nand the amount of money their clients spend to onboard, and they can do it in a day instead of five weeks\nthat we talked about. This quarter, we will complete the installation of a new platform for our wealth\nbusiness.\n13\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nOur advisers and private bankers have been working doing a great job and hitting a record of 15%\nincrease in fees, but they’ve done it really without the help of the institution. Well now technology is\ncatching up, and our clients will have a better digital experience and better client journey.\nWhether loan optimization. We now have workflow for credit. We didn’t have a workflow before. As you all\nwell know that helps in a lot of ways, gain efficiencies, mine data, creates an ability to measure what\nwe’re doing well what we’re not doing. That will flow straight into our loan system, through the investment\nof technology, which also reduces operating risk and gains efficiency. It’s happening all over the firm.\nThe investment in technology is something that I remember when we started, there was a real question\non whether we could -- there were concerned about us spending the money and making those\ninvestments. And I think with the reductions we’ve proven we’re actually really good at it. And also, you\ngot to remember, in our tech stack is we’ve written off most of the tech debt, and we have one stack.\nWe’re not a combination of two, three or four banks, spending money on technology for one system to\ntalk to another.\nWe’re one clean tech stack that we’re investing in and improving, which I can make another point, which\nby definition, we built the entirety of our tech stack with a payments platform, merchant, lockbox, et\ncetera, over the past three years, by definition, we have the newest tech stack. So we have the most\nrecent version of the best corporate card in market. We have the most recent version of a lot of these\nthings. We’re really, really excited and pleased that we can realize efficiencies from tech spend, and you\nshould look for more of it.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And we have the next question from Michael Rose with Raymond James.\nMichael Rose\nJust trying to better appreciate the loan growth expectations for next year. Can you just kind of break it\ndown? I assume some of it is a pickup in utilization. I assume some of it’s a migration of customers from\nlenders that you’ve hired over the past couple of years, maybe some reacceleration of growth in\ncommercial real estate.\nBut if you can just help us better appreciate the complexion of the growth. And as it relates specifically to\nthe lenders that have been brought on over the past few years, is that -- is the way you see that kind of a\nmultiyear kind of tailwind to growth kind of regardless of what the broader economy does?\n14\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nRob Holmes\nLook, I do think there’s tailwinds. Sorry, I thought I touched on this a little bit before. Our advantage is\nwhen we’re more relevant to our clients and we cover the entirety of the market through business\nbanking, middle market banking, corporate banking, in different vertical expertise in corporate banking\nfrom TMT, healthcare, FIG, diversified, energy, government not for profit. Whichever part of the economy\nexpands, we will capture, and we’ll capture that because we’re also capturing more clients on the platform\nyear-over-year than ever before.\n‘22 was a record year, ‘23 is a record year. This year, year-to-date, we gained 110% more clients than\nlast year. When loan demand picks up in the economy as the economy grows, we will be the beneficiary\nof that. We’re really excited about that. If they don’t need bank debt, we could also provide third-party\ncapital as well. So as companies expand, whether it’s in the bank market, private capital, private credit\nmarket or institutional market, we’ll be there and advise our clients on what is best for their cost of capital.\nMichael Rose\nI’m sorry if I made you repeat some of that got on a little bit late, lots of calls incoming but...\nRob Holmes\nYou didn’t.\nMatt Scurlock\nWe like repeating that.\nMichael Rose\nOkay. All right. Maybe just kind of one follow-up. I guess the way I kind of think about you guys, a lot of\nwork done over the past couple of years, the chassis built. I think you have the product set that you want\nand any additions would be, I would say kind of around the edges. Is that a fair characterization?\nThen just kind of continuing to drive the positive operating leverage every quarter and just playing out is\nfrom here, but no real major kind of additions to the platform at this point.\n15\n3rd Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call\nOctober 17th, 2024\nRob Holmes\nMichael, I can speak on behalf of every employee here saying we are grateful that is where we are. It’s\nbeen a long transformation, as you know. We will have incremental products and services that we had,\nI’m sure. I would say we are wholly complete with the platform, we could run this platform and be perfectly\nhappy with it as is for a long period of time, but we will continue to be opportunistic, if you will.\nOperator\nI would now like to hand it back to Rob Holmes for some final remarks.\nRob Holmes\nLook we’re really excited about where we are on the three-year anniversary of where we announced our\nstrategic plan. We’re more convinced than ever is the right strategic plan. The financial results would\nsupport that as our strategic actions are turning into financial outcomes. We’re grateful to our clients, our\nemployees. Thank you for listening.\nOperator\nThank you, all for joining the Texas Capital Bancshares third quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I\ncan confirm today’s call has now concluded. You may now disconnect from the call. And please enjoy the\nrest of your day.\n16"
