(“Pactiv Evergreen” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of 2024. Michael King, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pactiv Evergreen, said, “Our execution during the third quarter was solid and we made meaningful progress on our long-term strategy. We maintained strict cost discipline, optimized enterprise resources and overcame challenges at the Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill during its final quarter under our ownership. As we advance to the next phase of our transformational journey, we intend to leverage our heritage of product innovation and design to foster growth and assist our customers in achieving their sustainability goals.”\n\nKing continued, “In late September and early October, some of our teams and communities were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The safety and well-being of our team members remain our utmost priority. It’s been truly inspiring to witness our teams swiftly activate contingency plans in response to these severe weather events, showcasing their commitment to serving our customers and supporting the affected communities.”\n\nJon Baksht, Chief Financial Officer of Pactiv Evergreen, added, “Our third quarter results reflect our efforts to right size our operations and manage resources to align with the broader demand environment. Our team has done an excellent job reducing our cost to serve by implementing various initiatives to set Pactiv Evergreen up for success. Compared to the prior quarter, we reduced our leverage profile and are on track to deliver on the cost savings targets we laid out in August. We are also continuing to invest in areas of the business to drive growth for Pactiv Evergreen and create value for our stockholders.”\n\n___________________1 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures. All references to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are references to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, respectively. Refer to their definitions in the discussion on non-GAAP financial measures and the accompanying reconciliations below.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results vs. Third Quarter 2023 Results**\n\nNet revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were $1,333 million compared to $1,379 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Foodservice segment, mainly due to the pass through of higher material costs, and favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment. Lower sales volume was mostly due to a focus on value over volume in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and the broader demand environment.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $213 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $28 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. The change was principally due to the $322 million impairment charge resulting from the divestiture of our Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill and our Waynesville, North Carolina extrusion facility (the “Mill Transaction”). The change also reflects a $60 million decrease in tax expense largely as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $214 million and Adjusted EPS1 was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $227 million and $0.32, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 reflects higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive based compensation costs, favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, in the Foodservice segment. The increase in Adjusted EPS1 is primarily due to impacts of the aforementioned Mill Transaction.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n _Foodservice_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 670| $| 675| $| (5| )| (1| )%| 1| %| (2| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 120| $| 117| $| 3| 3| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin2| 18| %| 17| %  \n  \n2 For each segment, segment Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by total segment net revenues.\n\nThe decrease in net revenues was mostly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing, largely due to the pass through of higher material costs.

The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable product mix in the Foodservice segment. Lower sales volume was mainly due to seasonal trends in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $213 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $20 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024. The change was principally due to the $322 million Mill Transaction impairment charge. The change also reflects a $49 million decrease in tax expense largely as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $214 million and Adjusted EPS1 was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $183 million and $0.17, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA1 and Adjusted EPS1 was mainly due to lower manufacturing costs as a result of a planned mill outage during the second quarter, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n _Foodservice_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **September 30****,****2024**| **June 30****,****2024**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 670| $| 668| $| 2| —| %| 1| %| (1| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 120| $| 109| $| 11| 10| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin| 18| %| 16| %  \n  \nThe increase in net revenues was mostly due to favorable product mix, largely offset by lower sales volume.\n\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to favorable product mix, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and lower incentive based costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.\n\n_Food and Beverage Merchandising_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **September 30****,****2024**| **June 30****,****2024**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 667| $| 674| $| (7| )| (1| )%| 1| %| (2| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 111| $| 93| $| 18| 19| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin| 17| %| 14| %  \n  \nThe decrease in net revenues was due to lower sales volume which was attributable to seasonal trends, partially offset by favorable pricing due to pricing actions.\n\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflects lower manufacturing costs, mainly as a result of a planned mill outage during the second quarter, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and lower incentive based costs, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights**\n\nThe Company continues to deliver on its commitment to strengthen its balance sheet. Since December 31, 2022, the Company has reduced its total outstanding debt by $641 million, and Net Debt3 declined by $278 million. The Company’s Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend on November 8, 2024 of $0.10 per share of common stock, payable on December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024.\n\n_**(In millions)**_| **As of****September 30, 2024**|  _**(In millions)**_| **For the Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal outstanding debt| $| 3,495| Net cash flow provided by operating activities| $| 244  \nCash and cash equivalents| (168| )| Capital expenditures| (54| )  \nNet Debt3| **$**| **3,327**|  Free Cash Flow3| **$**| **190**  \n  \n**Outlook**\n\n“We have made significant progress on our strategy this year, and as we look ahead to 2025, we believe we have established a solid foundation for the next leg of our transformational journey. We are dedicated to carefully overseeing our operations, preserving a strong balance sheet and driving growth, which includes innovation and identifying opportunities to extend our reach beyond the conventional channels we currently serve,” said Mr. King. “The Company is updating its existing guidance range for full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA1 to a range of $800 million to $810 million in light of the performance of the operations divested in the Mill Transaction prior to closing,” he added.\n\nThe Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA1 to the GAAP measure net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis in this release because the Company does not provide guidance for certain of the reconciling items on a consistent basis, including but not limited to items relating to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense and income taxes, which would be required to include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA1 to GAAP net income (loss), as the Company is unable to quantify these amounts without unreasonable efforts.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Presentation**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast presentation to discuss these results on November 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time. Investors interested in participating in the live call may register for the call [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xjfp-03BZzNFqRUCDOv1zsR6t33AI-EbbYDIgYvMpO6sFxXlcnksrY_tcchqviXbx_Z2GK9jmPKs_CtLw1PvDSu6_g5b5k0-BAlbLK4UjFE=).

Refer to their definitions in the discussion on non-GAAP financial measures below.\n\n**Note to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our guidance as to future financial and operational results, our ability to assist our customers in achieving their sustainability goals, our ability to drive growth and create value for stockholders and our ability to preserve a strong balance sheet, innovate and identify opportunities to extend our reach beyond our conventional channels. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “likely” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions based on our expectations and projections about future events as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove incorrect, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, among others, those described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 filed with the SEC. New risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can management assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement the Company makes. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except as otherwise required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company uses the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”): Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as net income (loss) from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP plus the sum of income tax expense (benefit), net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains or losses on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange gains or losses on cash and gains or losses on certain legal settlements.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EPS from continuing operations as diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations (“EPS”) calculated in accordance with GAAP adjusted for the after-tax effect of certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange losses on cash, gains or losses on certain legal settlements and gains or losses on debt extinguishments.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.\n\nThe Company defines Net Debt as the sum of current and long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company has provided herein a reconciliation of (i) net income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, (ii) diluted (loss) EPS from continuing operations to Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, (iii) net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow and (iv) total debt to Net Debt, in each case representing the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to assist in comparing performance from period to period and as a measure of operational performance. It is a key measure used by its management team to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward its employees. In addition, its management and Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer, use the Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of each reportable segment to evaluate its respective operating performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. Like Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, management believes Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is useful to investors, analysts and others to facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis because it excludes variations primarily caused by changes in the items noted above.\n\nThe Company presents Free Cash Flow to assist in comparing liquidity from period to period and to provide a more comprehensive view of the Company’s core operations and ability to generate cash flow, and also, as with Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward its employees. The Company believes that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating cash available to service and repay debt, make other investments and pay dividends. The Company presents Net Debt as a supplemental measure to review the liquidity of its operations and measure the Company’s credit position and progress toward leverage targets. The Company also believes that investors find this measure useful in evaluating its debt levels.\n\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP metrics may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider them alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations and other metrics derived from them, you should be aware that in the future the Company will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments in deriving Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations and you should not infer from our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations that our future results will not be affected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items.\n\n**Contact:****Curt Worthington**

(“Pactiv Evergreen” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of 2024. Michael King, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pactiv Evergreen, said, “Our execution during the third quarter was solid and we made meaningful progress on our long-term strategy. We maintained strict cost discipline, optimized enterprise resources and overcame challenges at the Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill during its final quarter under our ownership. As we advance to the next phase of our transformational journey, we intend to leverage our heritage of product innovation and design to foster growth and assist our customers in achieving their sustainability goals.”\n\nKing continued, “In late September and early October, some of our teams and communities were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The safety and well-being of our team members remain our utmost priority. It’s been truly inspiring to witness our teams swiftly activate contingency plans in response to these severe weather events, showcasing their commitment to serving our customers and supporting the affected communities.”\n\nJon Baksht, Chief Financial Officer of Pactiv Evergreen, added, “Our third quarter results reflect our efforts to right size our operations and manage resources to align with the broader demand environment. Our team has done an excellent job reducing our cost to serve by implementing various initiatives to set Pactiv Evergreen up for success. Compared to the prior quarter, we reduced our leverage profile and are on track to deliver on the cost savings targets we laid out in August. We are also continuing to invest in areas of the business to drive growth for Pactiv Evergreen and create value for our stockholders.”\n\n___________________1 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures. All references to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are references to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, respectively. Refer to their definitions in the discussion on non-GAAP financial measures and the accompanying reconciliations below.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results vs. Third Quarter 2023 Results**\n\nNet revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were $1,333 million compared to $1,379 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Foodservice segment, mainly due to the pass through of higher material costs, and favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment. Lower sales volume was mostly due to a focus on value over volume in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and the broader demand environment.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $213 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $28 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. The change was principally due to the $322 million impairment charge resulting from the divestiture of our Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill and our Waynesville, North Carolina extrusion facility (the “Mill Transaction”). The change also reflects a $60 million decrease in tax expense largely as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $214 million and Adjusted EPS1 was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $227 million and $0.32, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 reflects higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive based compensation costs, favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, in the Foodservice segment. The increase in Adjusted EPS1 is primarily due to impacts of the aforementioned Mill Transaction.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n _Foodservice_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 670| $| 675| $| (5| )| (1| )%| 1| %| (2| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 120| $| 117| $| 3| 3| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin2| 18| %| 17| %  \n  \n2 For each segment, segment Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by total segment net revenues.\n\nThe decrease in net revenues was mostly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing, largely due to the pass through of higher material costs.

The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable product mix in the Foodservice segment. Lower sales volume was mainly due to seasonal trends in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $213 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $20 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024. The change was principally due to the $322 million Mill Transaction impairment charge. The change also reflects a $49 million decrease in tax expense largely as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $214 million and Adjusted EPS1 was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $183 million and $0.17, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA1 and Adjusted EPS1 was mainly due to lower manufacturing costs as a result of a planned mill outage during the second quarter, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n _Foodservice_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **September 30****,****2024**| **June 30****,****2024**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 670| $| 668| $| 2| —| %| 1| %| (1| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 120| $| 109| $| 11| 10| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin| 18| %| 16| %  \n  \nThe increase in net revenues was mostly due to favorable product mix, largely offset by lower sales volume.\n\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to favorable product mix, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and lower incentive based costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.\n\n_Food and Beverage Merchandising_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **September 30****,****2024**| **June 30****,****2024**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 667| $| 674| $| (7| )| (1| )%| 1| %| (2| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 111| $| 93| $| 18| 19| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin| 17| %| 14| %  \n  \nThe decrease in net revenues was due to lower sales volume which was attributable to seasonal trends, partially offset by favorable pricing due to pricing actions.\n\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflects lower manufacturing costs, mainly as a result of a planned mill outage during the second quarter, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and lower incentive based costs, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights**\n\nThe Company continues to deliver on its commitment to strengthen its balance sheet. Since December 31, 2022, the Company has reduced its total outstanding debt by $641 million, and Net Debt3 declined by $278 million. The Company’s Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend on November 8, 2024 of $0.10 per share of common stock, payable on December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024.\n\n_**(In millions)**_| **As of****September 30, 2024**|  _**(In millions)**_| **For the Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal outstanding debt| $| 3,495| Net cash flow provided by operating activities| $| 244  \nCash and cash equivalents| (168| )| Capital expenditures| (54| )  \nNet Debt3| **$**| **3,327**|  Free Cash Flow3| **$**| **190**  \n  \n**Outlook**\n\n“We have made significant progress on our strategy this year, and as we look ahead to 2025, we believe we have established a solid foundation for the next leg of our transformational journey. We are dedicated to carefully overseeing our operations, preserving a strong balance sheet and driving growth, which includes innovation and identifying opportunities to extend our reach beyond the conventional channels we currently serve,” said Mr. King. “The Company is updating its existing guidance range for full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA1 to a range of $800 million to $810 million in light of the performance of the operations divested in the Mill Transaction prior to closing,” he added.\n\nThe Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA1 to the GAAP measure net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis in this release because the Company does not provide guidance for certain of the reconciling items on a consistent basis, including but not limited to items relating to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense and income taxes, which would be required to include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA1 to GAAP net income (loss), as the Company is unable to quantify these amounts without unreasonable efforts.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Presentation**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast presentation to discuss these results on November 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time. Investors interested in participating in the live call may register for the call [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xjfp-03BZzNFqRUCDOv1zsR6t33AI-EbbYDIgYvMpO6sFxXlcnksrY_tcchqviXbx_Z2GK9jmPKs_CtLw1PvDSu6_g5b5k0-BAlbLK4UjFE=).

All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our guidance as to future financial and operational results, our ability to assist our customers in achieving their sustainability goals, our ability to drive growth and create value for stockholders and our ability to preserve a strong balance sheet, innovate and identify opportunities to extend our reach beyond our conventional channels. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “may,” “might,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “potential,” “likely” or “continue,” the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions based on our expectations and projections about future events as of the date of this press release and are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove incorrect, any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including, among others, those described under the heading “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 filed with the SEC. New risks emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can management assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement the Company makes. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Except as otherwise required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company uses the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”): Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as net income (loss) from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP plus the sum of income tax expense (benefit), net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains or losses on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange gains or losses on cash and gains or losses on certain legal settlements.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EPS from continuing operations as diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations (“EPS”) calculated in accordance with GAAP adjusted for the after-tax effect of certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange losses on cash, gains or losses on certain legal settlements and gains or losses on debt extinguishments.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.\n\nThe Company defines Net Debt as the sum of current and long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company has provided herein a reconciliation of (i) net income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, (ii) diluted (loss) EPS from continuing operations to Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, (iii) net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow and (iv) total debt to Net Debt, in each case representing the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to assist in comparing performance from period to period and as a measure of operational performance. It is a key measure used by its management team to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward its employees. In addition, its management and Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer, use the Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of each reportable segment to evaluate its respective operating performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. Like Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, management believes Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is useful to investors, analysts and others to facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis because it excludes variations primarily caused by changes in the items noted above.\n\nThe Company presents Free Cash Flow to assist in comparing liquidity from period to period and to provide a more comprehensive view of the Company’s core operations and ability to generate cash flow, and also, as with Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward its employees. The Company believes that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating cash available to service and repay debt, make other investments and pay dividends. The Company presents Net Debt as a supplemental measure to review the liquidity of its operations and measure the Company’s credit position and progress toward leverage targets. The Company also believes that investors find this measure useful in evaluating its debt levels.\n\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP metrics may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider them alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations and other metrics derived from them, you should be aware that in the future the Company will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments in deriving Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations and you should not infer from our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations that our future results will not be affected by these expenses or any unusual or non-recurring items.\n\n**Contact:****Curt Worthington**

Made in the USA, SmartPour packaging features an easy-to-pour and resealable closure, making it the ideal container for pourable, dry ingredients like premium cereals, crackers, snacks, baking ingredients, pet food, powders or formulas, and powdered laundry or dish detergents.\n\nSmartPour containers eliminate the need for a plastic bag insert, preventing messy, bag-in-box spillage, while the resealable closure and barrier technology keeps contents fresh. With a sturdy design that maintains its shape, SmartPour is perfect for consumer-packaged goods companies looking to enhance product visibility on shelves and preserve the packaging integrity of products ordered via home delivery services.\n\nSmartPour packaging is food safe and FDA compliant and comes in six sizes, a vertical and horizontal layout, and three heights, offering a customizable solution for a variety of packaging needs.\n\nPactiv Evergreen will showcase SmartPour containers at PACK EXPO International in Chicago, Illinois from November 3-6, 2024. In addition to SmartPour, Pactiv Evergreen will also have its two new beverage carton filling machines on display at the expo. This state-of-the-art equipment includes the N-200 designed for filling school milk cartons and the H-40M, a new half-gallon filling machine. Both innovative machines utilize Pactiv Evergreen’s 60+ years of industry-leading experience in gable top carton filling equipment, exemplifying a longstanding dedication to excellence and providing advanced consumer solutions. Visit Pactiv Evergreen at booth N-5629 in the North Building to learn how its new filling equipment and SmartPour packaging can be a solution for your business.\n\n“Pactiv Evergreen’s SmartPour containers meet consumer demand for a pourable and resealable packaging solution for dry ingredients, benefiting food manufacturers, CPG companies, and retailers alike,” said Eric Wulf, President of Pactiv Evergreen’s Food and Beverage Merchandising business unit. “We are proud to leverage our expertise in liquid beverage packaging – specifically cartons, closures, and machinery – to now offer the same dependable packaging solution for dry and pourable ingredients.”\n\n“Pactiv Evergreen’s SmartPour packaging has been pre-qualified as ‘Widely Recyclable’ by How2Recycle®**,” said Lynn Dyer, Chief Sustainability Officer for Pactiv Evergreen. “Moreover, SmartPour containers can be conveniently recycled through one-step curbside recycling, allowing consumers to place the entire container in their recycling bin. We are dedicated to supporting our customers in achieving their sustainability goals and are proud that the paper used in our SmartPour package comes from trees grown in forests that follow responsible forestry practices.”\n\nLearn more about SmartPour packaging: [https://pactivevergreen.com/smartpour](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xl_rSgMb-BYsuY8K7Ayq4vBpHJID7pVa5tNi3VAyJPWCZc7utuHF8NpGTPtPTOMM-3IJso7YCPF4bjgg2Hi_Z_CaAQKOOCX59V3QELs5Sax82EhB3NKK3_jinTyBrhx-UjW46v4tVQxyKMmQ7MaDng==).\n\n**About Pactiv Evergreen Inc.** Pactiv Evergreen Inc.

(“Pactiv Evergreen” or the “Company”) today reported results for the third quarter of 2024. Michael King, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pactiv Evergreen, said, “Our execution during the third quarter was solid and we made meaningful progress on our long-term strategy. We maintained strict cost discipline, optimized enterprise resources and overcame challenges at the Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill during its final quarter under our ownership. As we advance to the next phase of our transformational journey, we intend to leverage our heritage of product innovation and design to foster growth and assist our customers in achieving their sustainability goals.”\n\nKing continued, “In late September and early October, some of our teams and communities were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The safety and well-being of our team members remain our utmost priority. It’s been truly inspiring to witness our teams swiftly activate contingency plans in response to these severe weather events, showcasing their commitment to serving our customers and supporting the affected communities.”\n\nJon Baksht, Chief Financial Officer of Pactiv Evergreen, added, “Our third quarter results reflect our efforts to right size our operations and manage resources to align with the broader demand environment. Our team has done an excellent job reducing our cost to serve by implementing various initiatives to set Pactiv Evergreen up for success. Compared to the prior quarter, we reduced our leverage profile and are on track to deliver on the cost savings targets we laid out in August. We are also continuing to invest in areas of the business to drive growth for Pactiv Evergreen and create value for our stockholders.”\n\n___________________1 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP measures. All references to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are references to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, respectively. Refer to their definitions in the discussion on non-GAAP financial measures and the accompanying reconciliations below.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results vs. Third Quarter 2023 Results**\n\nNet revenues in the third quarter of 2024 were $1,333 million compared to $1,379 million in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Foodservice segment, mainly due to the pass through of higher material costs, and favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment. Lower sales volume was mostly due to a focus on value over volume in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and the broader demand environment.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $213 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $28 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. The change was principally due to the $322 million impairment charge resulting from the divestiture of our Pine Bluff, Arkansas mill and our Waynesville, North Carolina extrusion facility (the “Mill Transaction”). The change also reflects a $60 million decrease in tax expense largely as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $214 million and Adjusted EPS1 was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $227 million and $0.32, respectively, in the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 reflects higher manufacturing costs and lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive based compensation costs, favorable product mix in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, in the Foodservice segment. The increase in Adjusted EPS1 is primarily due to impacts of the aforementioned Mill Transaction.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n _Foodservice_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended September 30,**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **2024**| **2023**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 670| $| 675| $| (5| )| (1| )%| 1| %| (2| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 120| $| 117| $| 3| 3| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin2| 18| %| 17| %  \n  \n2 For each segment, segment Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by total segment net revenues.\n\nThe decrease in net revenues was mostly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing, largely due to the pass through of higher material costs.

The decrease was mostly due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable pricing in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment and favorable product mix in the Foodservice segment. Lower sales volume was mainly due to seasonal trends in the Food and Beverage Merchandising segment.\n\nNet loss from continuing operations was $213 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to net income of $20 million, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2024. The change was principally due to the $322 million Mill Transaction impairment charge. The change also reflects a $49 million decrease in tax expense largely as a result of the aforementioned impairment charge.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA1 was $214 million and Adjusted EPS1 was $0.36 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $183 million and $0.17, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA1 and Adjusted EPS1 was mainly due to lower manufacturing costs as a result of a planned mill outage during the second quarter, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\n**Segment Results**\n\n _Foodservice_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **September 30****,****2024**| **June 30****,****2024**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 670| $| 668| $| 2| —| %| 1| %| (1| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 120| $| 109| $| 11| 10| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin| 18| %| 16| %  \n  \nThe increase in net revenues was mostly due to favorable product mix, largely offset by lower sales volume.\n\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to favorable product mix, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and lower incentive based costs, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.\n\n_Food and Beverage Merchandising_\n\n**For the Three Months Ended**| **Components of Change in Net Revenues**  \n---|---  \n _**(In millions, except for %)**_| **September 30****,****2024**| **June 30****,****2024**| **Change**| **Change %**| **Price/Mix**| **Volume**  \nTotal segment net revenues| $| 667| $| 674| $| (7| )| (1| )%| 1| %| (2| )%  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA| $| 111| $| 93| $| 18| 19| %  \nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin| 17| %| 14| %  \n  \nThe decrease in net revenues was due to lower sales volume which was attributable to seasonal trends, partially offset by favorable pricing due to pricing actions.\n\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflects lower manufacturing costs, mainly as a result of a planned mill outage during the second quarter, favorable pricing, net of material costs passed through, and lower incentive based costs, partially offset by lower sales volume.\n\n**Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights**\n\nThe Company continues to deliver on its commitment to strengthen its balance sheet. Since December 31, 2022, the Company has reduced its total outstanding debt by $641 million, and Net Debt3 declined by $278 million. The Company’s Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2024 dividend on November 8, 2024 of $0.10 per share of common stock, payable on December 13, 2024 to shareholders of record as of December 2, 2024.\n\n_**(In millions)**_| **As of****September 30, 2024**|  _**(In millions)**_| **For the Three Months Ended****September 30, 2024**  \n---|---|---|---  \nTotal outstanding debt| $| 3,495| Net cash flow provided by operating activities| $| 244  \nCash and cash equivalents| (168| )| Capital expenditures| (54| )  \nNet Debt3| **$**| **3,327**|  Free Cash Flow3| **$**| **190**  \n  \n**Outlook**\n\n“We have made significant progress on our strategy this year, and as we look ahead to 2025, we believe we have established a solid foundation for the next leg of our transformational journey. We are dedicated to carefully overseeing our operations, preserving a strong balance sheet and driving growth, which includes innovation and identifying opportunities to extend our reach beyond the conventional channels we currently serve,” said Mr. King. “The Company is updating its existing guidance range for full year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA1 to a range of $800 million to $810 million in light of the performance of the operations divested in the Mill Transaction prior to closing,” he added.\n\nThe Company has not reconciled the non-GAAP measure Adjusted EBITDA1 to the GAAP measure net income (loss) on a forward-looking basis in this release because the Company does not provide guidance for certain of the reconciling items on a consistent basis, including but not limited to items relating to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, depreciation and amortization expense, net interest expense and income taxes, which would be required to include a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA1 to GAAP net income (loss), as the Company is unable to quantify these amounts without unreasonable efforts.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Presentation**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast presentation to discuss these results on November 12, 2024 at 8:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time. Investors interested in participating in the live call may register for the call [here](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xjfp-03BZzNFqRUCDOv1zsR6t33AI-EbbYDIgYvMpO6sFxXlcnksrY_tcchqviXbx_Z2GK9jmPKs_CtLw1PvDSu6_g5b5k0-BAlbLK4UjFE=).

Except as otherwise required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe Company uses the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”): Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, Free Cash Flow and Net Debt.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations as net income (loss) from continuing operations calculated in accordance with GAAP plus the sum of income tax expense (benefit), net interest expense, depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains or losses on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange gains or losses on cash and gains or losses on certain legal settlements.\n\nThe Company defines Adjusted EPS from continuing operations as diluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations (“EPS”) calculated in accordance with GAAP adjusted for the after-tax effect of certain items, including but not limited to restructuring, asset impairment and other related charges, gains on the sale of businesses and noncurrent assets, non-cash pension income or expense, unrealized gains or losses on derivatives, foreign exchange losses on cash, gains or losses on certain legal settlements and gains or losses on debt extinguishments.\n\nThe Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.\n\nThe Company defines Net Debt as the sum of current and long-term debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe Company has provided herein a reconciliation of (i) net income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, (ii) diluted (loss) EPS from continuing operations to Adjusted EPS from continuing operations, (iii) net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow and (iv) total debt to Net Debt, in each case representing the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to assist in comparing performance from period to period and as a measure of operational performance. It is a key measure used by its management team to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward its employees. In addition, its management and Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is the President and Chief Executive Officer, use the Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of each reportable segment to evaluate its respective operating performance. Accordingly, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors. Like Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, management believes Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is useful to investors, analysts and others to facilitate operating performance comparisons on a period-to-period basis because it excludes variations primarily caused by changes in the items noted above.\n\nThe Company presents Free Cash Flow to assist in comparing liquidity from period to period and to provide a more comprehensive view of the Company’s core operations and ability to generate cash flow, and also, as with Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, to generate future operating plans, make strategic decisions and incentivize and reward its employees. The Company believes that this measure is useful to investors in evaluating cash available to service and repay debt, make other investments and pay dividends. The Company presents Net Debt as a supplemental measure to review the liquidity of its operations and measure the Company’s credit position and progress toward leverage targets. The Company also believes that investors find this measure useful in evaluating its debt levels.\n\nNon-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP metrics may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Because of these and other limitations, you should consider them alongside other financial performance measures, including our net income and other GAAP results. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, Adjusted EPS from continuing operations and other metrics derived from them, you should be aware that in the future the Company will incur expenses such as those that are the subject of adjustments in deriving Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Adjusted EPS from continuing operations and you should not infer from
