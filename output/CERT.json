(Nasdaq: CERT), a global leader in model-informed drug development, today reported its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenue was $94.8 million, compared to $85.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 11%. \n    * Software revenue was $35.9 million, compared to $31.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 15%.\n    * Services revenue was $58.9 million, compared to $54.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 9%.\n  * Net loss was $1.4 million, compared to a net loss of $49.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * The $47.6 million increase was primarily due to a $47.0 million decrease in goodwill impairment expense.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $33.1 million, compared to $28.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 15%.\n\n\n\n\"Certara’s results demonstrated strength in biosimulation software and services which are the result of our continued investment in biosimulation,\" said William F. Feehery, Chief Executive Officer. “Following the close of the Chemaxon transaction, we are focused on integrating our software capabilities to generate a best-in-class, lab-to-clinic biosimulation platform.\"\n\n\"We are pleased with the growth in our software business. Our services business was mixed, with biosimulation services growing 13% offset by weaker performance in our regulatory services business. In the second half of the year, we will continue to diligently manage our expense structure to support demand for core biosimulation software and services,\" said John Gallagher, Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $94.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 11% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. The overall increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in our biosimulation software portfolio. Please see note (1) in the section A Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information on constant currency revenue.\n\nSoftware revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $35.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% on a reported basis and 14% on a constant currency basis. Software growth was driven by biosimulation software and Pinnacle 21.\n\nServices revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $58.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of 9% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Services growth was impacted by cautious spending among large biopharma customers.\n\nTotal Bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were $96.1 million representing a year-over-year growth of 13% on a reported basis.\n\nSoftware Bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were $34.8 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 28%. The increase in software bookings was primarily due to strength in Certara’s core biosimulation software and Pinnacle 21.\n\nServices Bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were $61.3 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 6% on a reported basis.\n\nTotal cost of revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $37.2 million, an increase of $1.3 million from $35.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and software amortization.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $55.0 million, which decreased by $47.4 million from $102.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Lower operating expenses were primarily due to a $47.0 million decrease in goodwill impairment expense, as well as a strategic re-allocation of resources made during the second quarter of 2024 to optimize Certara’s cost structure.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $33.1 million compared to $28.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $4.2 million. See note (2) in the section _A Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ below for more information on adjusted EBITDA.\n\nDiluted loss per share for the third quarter 2024 was $0.01, as compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.31 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, compared to a net loss of $49.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $47.6 million increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses.\n\nAdjusted net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $20.3 million compared to $17.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $3.2 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2024 was $0.13 compared to $0.11 for the third quarter of 2023. See note (3) in the section _A Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ below for more information on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n\n**THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,**| **NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n __Key Financials__|  _(in millions, except per share data)_  \nRevenue| $| 94.8| $| 85.6| $| 284.8| $| 266.3  \nSoftware revenue| $| 35.9| $| 31.3| $| 113.4| $| 98.1  \nService revenue| $| 58.9| $| 54.2| $| 171.4| $| 168.3  \nTotal bookings| $| 96.1| $| 84.8| $| 300.8| $| 283.4  \nSoftware bookings| $| 34.8| $| 27.2| $| 109.8| $| 93.6  \nService bookings| $| 61.3| $| 57.6| $| 191.0| $| 189.8  \nNet income (loss)| $| (1.4| )| $| (49.0| )| $| (18.6| )| $| (42.9| )  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| (0.01| )| $| (0.31| )| $| (0.12| )| $| (0.27| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 33.1| $| 28.8| $| 88.5| $| 93.5  \nAdjusted net income| $| 20.3| $| 17.1| $| 48.2| $| 54.7  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share| $| 0.13| $| 0.11| $| 0.30| $| 0.34  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 233.0| $| 272.3  \n  \n**2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nCertara is updating its 2024 outlook, and expects the following:\n\n  * Full year 2024 revenue to be in the range of $380 million to $385 million.\n  * Full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $120 million to $124 million.\n  * Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.41 - $0.44.\n  * Fully diluted shares are expected to be in the range of 160 million to 162 million.\n\n\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nCertara will host a conference call today, November 6, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results.

Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release and, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of them to reflect actual results, any changes in expectations or any change in events.\n\nA Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release contains “non-GAAP measures” which are financial measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Specifically, the Company makes use of the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings per share, and constant currency (“CC”) revenue, which are not recognized terms under GAAP. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or GAAP diluted earnings per share or revenue as measures of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to the Company to invest in the growth of its business. The presentation of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company.\n\nYou should refer to the footnotes below as well as the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section in this press release below for a further explanation of these measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in specific periods to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for those periods.\n\nManagement uses various financial metrics, including total revenues, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), and certain non-GAAP measures, including those discussed above, to measure and assess the performance of the Company’s business, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to make certain compensation decisions, and to compare the Company’s performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In addition, management believes these metrics provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s business, as they remove the effect of certain non-cash expenses and other items not indicative of its ongoing operating performance.\n\nManagement believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings per share, and CC revenue are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical periods. In addition, each of these measures is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance. Furthermore, our business has operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We adjust revenues for constant currency to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance.\n\nPlease note that the Company has not reconciled the adjusted EBITDA or adjusted diluted earnings per share forward-looking guidance included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to costs related to acquisitions, financings, and employee stock compensation programs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n(1)| CC revenue excludes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation. Current periods revenue reported in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior periods.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and integration expense and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.  \n(3)| Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of equity-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and integration expense, and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance as well as income tax provision adjustment for such charges.  \n  \nIn evaluating adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation and this presentation should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual items.\n\n**Contacts:**\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** David DeuchlerGilmartin Group[ir@certara.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qFXBUyWvfmpDk8OUfO7KqsVzqeADcAjSG796VSsNZ4n1CGtV9VVMT7mCZZyRcXeQn3E9WNFSzOrMaRTnlRAFVg==)\n\n**Media Contact:** Alyssa HorowitzPan Communications[certara@pancomm.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3qhX3ycqRtyHDKRhkq3YsBy6dYzNYl8Zu31G5vbZqaWurdpstEiS8W6g5Ub5u7UFAq3fglMro8pzJeg_S4uO5FKRg2XHw1hU2l6WK9vmx2I=)\n\n**CERTARA, INC.

(Nasdaq: CERT), a global leader in model-informed drug development, today reported its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Highlights:**\n\n  * Revenue was $94.8 million, compared to $85.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 11%. \n    * Software revenue was $35.9 million, compared to $31.3 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 15%.\n    * Services revenue was $58.9 million, compared to $54.2 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 9%.\n  * Net loss was $1.4 million, compared to a net loss of $49.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. \n    * The $47.6 million increase was primarily due to a $47.0 million decrease in goodwill impairment expense.\n  * Adjusted EBITDA was $33.1 million, compared to $28.8 million in the third quarter of 2023, representing growth of 15%.\n\n\n\n\"Certara’s results demonstrated strength in biosimulation software and services which are the result of our continued investment in biosimulation,\" said William F. Feehery, Chief Executive Officer. “Following the close of the Chemaxon transaction, we are focused on integrating our software capabilities to generate a best-in-class, lab-to-clinic biosimulation platform.\"\n\n\"We are pleased with the growth in our software business. Our services business was mixed, with biosimulation services growing 13% offset by weaker performance in our regulatory services business. In the second half of the year, we will continue to diligently manage our expense structure to support demand for core biosimulation software and services,\" said John Gallagher, Chief Financial Officer.\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Results**\n\nTotal revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $94.8 million, representing year-over-year growth of 11% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. The overall increase in revenue was primarily due to growth in our biosimulation software portfolio. Please see note (1) in the section A Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information on constant currency revenue.\n\nSoftware revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $35.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% on a reported basis and 14% on a constant currency basis. Software growth was driven by biosimulation software and Pinnacle 21.\n\nServices revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $58.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of 9% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Services growth was impacted by cautious spending among large biopharma customers.\n\nTotal Bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were $96.1 million representing a year-over-year growth of 13% on a reported basis.\n\nSoftware Bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were $34.8 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 28%. The increase in software bookings was primarily due to strength in Certara’s core biosimulation software and Pinnacle 21.\n\nServices Bookings for the third quarter of 2024 were $61.3 million, representing a year-over-year growth of 6% on a reported basis.\n\nTotal cost of revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $37.2 million, an increase of $1.3 million from $35.9 million in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and software amortization.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $55.0 million, which decreased by $47.4 million from $102.5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Lower operating expenses were primarily due to a $47.0 million decrease in goodwill impairment expense, as well as a strategic re-allocation of resources made during the second quarter of 2024 to optimize Certara’s cost structure.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024 was $33.1 million compared to $28.8 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $4.2 million. See note (2) in the section _A Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ below for more information on adjusted EBITDA.\n\nDiluted loss per share for the third quarter 2024 was $0.01, as compared to a diluted loss per share of $0.31 in the third quarter of 2023.\n\nNet loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.4 million, compared to a net loss of $49.0 million in the third quarter of 2023. The $47.6 million increase was primarily due to lower operating expenses.\n\nAdjusted net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $20.3 million compared to $17.1 million for the third quarter of 2023, an increase of $3.2 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2024 was $0.13 compared to $0.11 for the third quarter of 2023. See note (3) in the section _A Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures_ below for more information on adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share.\n\n**THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,**| **NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \n __Key Financials__|  _(in millions, except per share data)_  \nRevenue| $| 94.8| $| 85.6| $| 284.8| $| 266.3  \nSoftware revenue| $| 35.9| $| 31.3| $| 113.4| $| 98.1  \nService revenue| $| 58.9| $| 54.2| $| 171.4| $| 168.3  \nTotal bookings| $| 96.1| $| 84.8| $| 300.8| $| 283.4  \nSoftware bookings| $| 34.8| $| 27.2| $| 109.8| $| 93.6  \nService bookings| $| 61.3| $| 57.6| $| 191.0| $| 189.8  \nNet income (loss)| $| (1.4| )| $| (49.0| )| $| (18.6| )| $| (42.9| )  \nDiluted earnings per share| $| (0.01| )| $| (0.31| )| $| (0.12| )| $| (0.27| )  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| 33.1| $| 28.8| $| 88.5| $| 93.5  \nAdjusted net income| $| 20.3| $| 17.1| $| 48.2| $| 54.7  \nAdjusted diluted earnings per share| $| 0.13| $| 0.11| $| 0.30| $| 0.34  \nCash and cash equivalents| $| 233.0| $| 272.3  \n  \n**2024 Financial Outlook**\n\nCertara is updating its 2024 outlook, and expects the following:\n\n  * Full year 2024 revenue to be in the range of $380 million to $385 million.\n  * Full year adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $120 million to $124 million.\n  * Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.41 - $0.44.\n  * Fully diluted shares are expected to be in the range of 160 million to 162 million.\n\n\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Details**\n\nCertara will host a conference call today, November 6, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. ET to discuss its third quarter 2024 financial results.

Specifically, the Company makes use of the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings per share, and constant currency (“CC”) revenue, which are not recognized terms under GAAP. These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or GAAP diluted earnings per share or revenue as measures of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to the Company to invest in the growth of its business. The presentation of these measures has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company.\n\nYou should refer to the footnotes below as well as the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section in this press release below for a further explanation of these measures and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures in specific periods to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP for those periods.\n\nManagement uses various financial metrics, including total revenues, income (loss) from operations, net income (loss), and certain non-GAAP measures, including those discussed above, to measure and assess the performance of the Company’s business, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to make certain compensation decisions, and to compare the Company’s performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. In addition, management believes these metrics provide useful measures for period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s business, as they remove the effect of certain non-cash expenses and other items not indicative of its ongoing operating performance.\n\nManagement believes that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings per share, and CC revenue are helpful to investors, analysts, and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical periods. In addition, each of these measures is frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance. Furthermore, our business has operations outside the United States that are conducted in local currencies. As a result, the comparability of the financial results reported in U.S. dollars is affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We adjust revenues for constant currency to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations and we believe it is helpful for investors to present operating results on a comparable basis period over period to evaluate its underlying performance.\n\nPlease note that the Company has not reconciled the adjusted EBITDA or adjusted diluted earnings per share forward-looking guidance included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP measures because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to costs related to acquisitions, financings, and employee stock compensation programs, which are potential adjustments to future earnings. We expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable, and a potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n(1)| CC revenue excludes the effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations by assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation. Current periods revenue reported in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior periods.  \n---|---  \n(2)| Adjusted EBITDA represents net income excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, intangible asset amortization, equity-based compensation expense, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and integration expense and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance.  \n(3)| Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share exclude the effect of equity-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition and integration expense, and other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance as well as income tax provision adjustment for such charges.  \n  \nIn evaluating adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation and this presentation should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual items.\n\n**Contacts:**\n\n**Investor Relations Contact:** David DeuchlerGilmartin Group[ir@certara.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=qFXBUyWvfmpDk8OUfO7KqsVzqeADcAjSG796VSsNZ4n1CGtV9VVMT7mCZZyRcXeQn3E9WNFSzOrMaRTnlRAFVg==)\n\n**Media Contact:** Alyssa HorowitzPan Communications[certara@pancomm.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=3qhX3ycqRtyHDKRhkq3YsBy6dYzNYl8Zu31G5vbZqaWurdpstEiS8W6g5Ub5u7UFAq3fglMro8pzJeg_S4uO5FKRg2XHw1hU2l6WK9vmx2I=)\n\n**CERTARA, INC.
