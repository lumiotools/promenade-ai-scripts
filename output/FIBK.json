Reports Third Quarter Earnings\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nBILLINGS, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIBK) (the “Company”) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $55.5 million, or $0.54 per share, which compares to net income of $60.0 million, or $0.58 per share, for the second quarter of 2024 and net income of $72.7 million, or $0.70 per share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Appointed James A. Reuter as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective end of day November 1, 2024. \n  * Net interest margin increased to 3.01% for the third quarter of 2024, a 4-basis point increase from the second quarter of 2024. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis 1 , increased to 3.04% for the third quarter of 2024, or a 4-basis point increase from the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Criticized loans decreased $14.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $618.0 million at June 30, 2024, driven mostly by charge-offs. Net Charge-offs of $27.4 million or 0.60 basis points of average loans included a commercial real estate loan and a construction real estate loan in the metro office portfolio totaling $22.1 million. Net charge-offs within the remaining portfolio totaled $5.3 million or 0.12% of average loans. \n  * Total deposits decreased by $6.6 million at September 30, 2024 from June 30, 2024, driven by a large temporary deposit included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2024 that was withdrawn early in the third quarter; excluding the large temporary deposit, deposits increased approximately 1% at September 30, 2024 from June 30, 2024. \n  * Non-interest expense increased $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense included $3.8 million related to the transition of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; excluding CEO transition expenses, non-interest expense decreased $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $5.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Capital ratios continued to improve during the third quarter of 2024, with common equity tier 1 capital ratio increasing 0.30% to 11.83%, compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n“We were pleased to see continued improvement in our core operating metrics in the quarter. Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Income improved for the second consecutive quarter, and Net Interest Margin exceeded 3%, excluding purchase accounting, in the month of September. The Company continued to exert expense discipline, and fee businesses performed generally in-line with expectations. While there was charge-off activity this quarter within the metro-office portfolio, we believe notable losses in that portfolio are now behind us. Looking into 2025, the Company is well positioned to experience continued profitability expansion,” said Kevin P. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. \n\n____________ \n\n1 Represents a Non-GAAP Financial Measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included below for a reconciliation to this measure’s most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n\n**DIVIDEND DECLARATION**\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s board of directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share, payable on November 14, 2024, to common stockholders of record as of November 4, 2024. The dividend equates to a 6.3% annualized yield based on the $29.85 per share average closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on NASDAQ during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest income increased $3.8 million, or 1.9%, to $205.5 million, during the third quarter of 2024, compared to net interest income of $201.7 million during the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans and a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in average debt balances. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher costs of interest-bearing deposits during the third quarter of 2024. Net interest income decreased $8.2 million, or 3.8%, during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from higher costs of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n  * Interest accretion attributable to the fair valuation of acquired loans from acquisitions contributed to net interest income during the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024, and the third quarter of 2023, in the amounts of $4.4 million, $5.1 million, and $5.2 million, respectively. \n\n\n\nThe net interest margin ratio was 3.01% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.97% during the second quarter of 2024, and 3.05% during the third quarter of 2023. The net FTE interest margin ratio 2 was 3.04% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.00% during the second quarter of 2024, and 3.07% during the third quarter of 2023. Excluding interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the adjusted net interest margin ratio (FTE) 2 , was 2.97%, an increase of 5 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by loan yield expansion and lower interest expense resulting from decreased borrowings. Excluding interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans, on a year-over-year basis, the adjusted net interest margin ratio (FTE) decreased 3 basis points, primarily as a result of higher interest-bearing deposit costs, which was partially offset by loan yield expansion and a modestly favorable change in the mix of earning assets. \n\n___________ \n\n2 Represents a Non-GAAP Financial Measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included below for a reconciliation to this measure’s most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n\n**PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $19.8 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $9.0 million during the second quarter of 2024 and a reduction in the provision for credit losses of $0.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. \n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the allowance for credit losses included net charge-offs of $27.4 million, or an annualized 0.60% of average loans outstanding, compared to net charge-offs of $13.5 million, or an annualized 0.30% of average loans outstanding, for the second quarter of 2024 and net charge-offs of $1.1 million, or an annualized 0.02% of average loans outstanding, for the third quarter of 2023. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were composed of charge-offs of $29.1 million, including a $15.9 million metro office commercial real estate loan and a $6.2 million metro office construction real estate loan, which were offset by recoveries of $1.7 million during the third quarter of 2024. As noted, metro office charge-offs were $22.1 million. Net charge-offs within the remaining portfolio totaled 0.12% of average loans in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans held for investment was 1.25% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.28% at June 30, 2024 and 1.24% at September 30, 2023. Coverage of non-performing loans decreased to 129.2% at September 30, 2024, compared to 138.4% at June 30, 2024 and 268.0% at September 30, 2023. \n\n**NON-INTEREST INCOME**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended** |  Sep 30, 2024  |  Jun 30, 2024  |  $ Change  |  % Change  |  Sep 30, 2023  |  $ Change  |  % Change   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in millions)_  \nPayment services revenues  |  $  |  18.7  |  $  |  18.6  |  $  |  0.1  |  0.5  |  %  |  $  |  19.2  |  $  |  (0.5  |  )  |  (2.6  |  )%   \nMortgage banking revenues  |  1.7  |  1.7  |  —  |  —  |  2.0  |  (0.3  |  )  |  (15.0  |  )   \nWealth management revenues  |  9.6  |  9.4  |  0.2  |  2.1  |  8.7  |  0.9  |  10.3   \nService charges on deposit accounts  |  6.6  |  6.4  |  0.2  |  3.1  |  6.0  |  0.6  |  10.0   \nOther service charges, commissions, and fees  |  2.2  |  2.1  |  0.1  |  4.8  |  2.2  |  —  |  —   \nOther income  |  7.6  |  4.4  |  3.2  |  72.7  |  3.9  |  3.7  |  94.9   \nTotal non-interest income  |  $  |  46.4  |  $  |  42.6  |  $  |  3.8  |  8.9  |  %  |  $  |  42.0  |  $  |  4.4  |  10.5  |  %   \n  \nNon-interest income was $46.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, increasing $3.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increasing $4.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increases were primarily due to a recorded gain-on-sale of $2.6 million related to the sale of a branch during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**NON-INTEREST EXPENSE**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended** |  Sep 30, 2024  |  Jun 30, 2024  |  $ Change  |  % Change  |  Sep 30, 2023  |  $ Change  |  % Change   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in millions)_  \nSalaries and wages  |  $  |  70.9  |  $  |  66.3  |  $  |  4.6  |  6.9  |  %  |  $  |  65.4  |  $  |  5.5  |  8.4  |  %   \nEmployee benefits  |  19.7  |  16.9  |  2.8  |  16.6  |  19.7  |  —  |  —   \nOccupancy and equipment  |  17.0  |  16.9  |  0.1  |  0.6  |  17.0  |  —  |  —   \nOther intangible amortization  |  3.6  |  3.7  |  (0.1  |  )  |  (2.7  |  )  |  3.9  |  (0.3  |  )  |  (7.7  |  )   \nOther expenses  |  48.2  |  51.1  |  (2.9  |  )  |  (5.7  |  )  |  54.6  |  (6.4  |  )  |  (11.7  |  )   \nOther real estate owned expense  |  —  |  2.0  |  (2.0  |  )  |  (100.0  |  )  |  0.5  |  (0.5  |  )  |  (100.0  |  )   \nTotal non-interest expense  |  $  |  159.4  |  $  |  156.9  |  $  |  2.5  |  1.6  |  %  |  $  |  161.1  |  $  |  (1.7  |  )  |  (1.1  |  )%   \n  \nThe Company’s non-interest expense was $159.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.5 million from the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $1.7 million from the third quarter of 2023. Expenses for the third quarter included $3.8 million related to the CEO transition. \n\nSalary and wages expense increased $4.6 million and $5.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The increase when compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the accrual of $3.8 million related to the CEO transition and the increase when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the accrual of $3.8 million related to the CEO transition, lower deferred loan costs, and higher short-term incentive accruals, partially offset by lower severance costs and lower salaries and wages from expense reduction initiatives undertaken by the Company in 2023. \n\nEmployee benefit expenses increased $2.8 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million in health insurance costs. Employee benefit expenses were unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOther expenses decreased $2.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower FDIC assessment fees and professional fees. Other expenses decreased $6.4 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from decreases in credit card reward accruals, professional fees, write-off of software costs, and reclassifications of new market tax credit amortization expenses, which moved to income tax expenses, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02. \n\nOther real estate owned expenses decreased $2.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $0.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the write down of two commercial properties in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**BALANCE SHEET**\n\nTotal assets decreased $694.0 million, or 2.3%, to $29,595.5 million as of September 30, 2024, from $30,289.5 million as of June 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in loans, cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and other assets. Total assets decreased $945.3 million, or 3.1%, from $30,540.8 million as of September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in investment securities, loans, and other assets which supported declines in deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements, which was partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. \n\nInvestment securities decreased $126.0 million, or 1.5%, to $8,275.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from $8,401.6 million as of June 30, 2024, primarily resulting from normal pay-downs and maturities, partially offset by a $158.5 million increase in fair market values of investment securities during the period. Investment securities decreased $611.6 million, or 6.9%, from $8,887.2 million as of September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from normal pay-downs and maturities, partially offset by a $330.8 million increase in fair market values during the period. \n\nThe following table presents the composition and comparison of loans held for investment as of the quarters-ended: \n\nSep 30, 2024  |  Jun 30, 2024  |  $ Change  |  % Change  |  Sep 30, 2023  |  $ Change  |  % Change   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nReal Estate:   \nCommercial  |  $  |  9,219.3  |  $  |  9,054.5  |  $  |  164.8  |  1.8  |  %  |  $  |  8,766.2  |  $  |  453.1  |  5.2  |  %   \nConstruction  |  1,307.9  |  1,519.9  |  (212.0  |  )  |  (13.9  |  )  |  1,930.3  |  (622.4  |  )  |  (32.2  |  )   \nResidential  |  2,217.8  |  2,246.4  |  (28.6  |  )  |  (1.3  |  )  |  2,212.2  |  5.6  |  0.3   \nAgricultural  |  726.4  |  723.5  |  2.9  |  0.4  |  731.5  |  (5.1  |  )  |  (0.7  |  )   \nTotal real estate  |  13,471.4  |  13,544.3  |  (72.9  |  )  |  (0.5  |  )  |  13,640.2  |  (168.8  |  )  |  (1.2  |  )   \nConsumer:   \nIndirect  |  742.2  |  733.7  |  8.5  |  1.2  |  751.7  |  (9.5  |  )  |  (1.3  |  )   \nDirect and advance lines  |  136.9  |  139.0  |  (2.1  |  )  |  (1.5  |  )  |  142.3  |  (5.4  |  )  |  (3.8  |  )   \nCredit card  |  76.4  |  76.1  |  0.3  |  0.4  |  71.6  |  4.8  |  6.7   \nTotal consumer  |  955.5  |  948.8  |  6.7  |  0.7  |  965.6  |  (10.1  |  )  |  (1.0  |  )   \nCommercial  |  2,919.7  |  3,052.9  |  (133.2  |  )  |  (4.4  |  )  |  2,925.1  |  (5.4  |  )  |  (0.2  |  )   \nAgricultural  |  689.8  |  698.2  |  (8.4  |  )  |  (1.2  |  )  |  690.5  |  (0.7  |  )  |  (0.1  |  )   \nOther, including overdrafts  |  2.5  |  3.1  |  (0.6  |  )  |  (19.4  |  )  |  5.0  |  (2.5  |  )  |  (50.0  |  )   \nDeferred loan fees and costs  |  (11.8  |  )  |  (12.3  |  )  |  0.5  |  (4.1  |  )  |  (13.1  |  )  |  1.3  |  (9.9  |  )   \nLoans held for investment, net of deferred loan fees and costs  |  $  |  18,027.1  |  $  |  18,235.0  |  $  |  (207.9  |  )  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  $  |  18,213.3  |  $  |  (186.2  |  )  |  (1.0  |  )%   \n  \nDeclines in the construction real estate loans are primarily a result of the conversion of loans to permanent commercial real estate financing. Commercial loans declined due to both declines in draws of operating line and payoffs. \n\nThe ratio of loans held for investment to deposits was 78.8%, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 79.7% as of June 30, 2024 and 76.9% as of September 30, 2023. \n\nTotal deposits decreased modestly by $6.6 million to $22,864.1 million as of September 30, 2024, from $22,870.7 million as of June 30, 2024, with decreases in non-interest bearing deposits, which were partially offset by increases in all interest-bearing categories. The decrease in total deposits was largely influenced by a large temporary deposit included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2024 which was withdrawn early in the third quarter. Total deposits decreased $815.4 million, or 3.4%, from $23,679.5 million as of September 30, 2023, with decreases in all types of deposits except for demand and savings deposits. Securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased $184.6 million, or 24.9%, to $557.2 million as of September 30, 2024, from $741.8 million as of June 30, 2024, and decreased $332.3 million, or 37.4%, from $889.5 million as of September 30, 2023, resulting from normal fluctuations in the liquidity needs of the Company’s clients. \n\nLong-term debt decreased $246.1 million, or 64.2%, to $137.3 million as of September 30, 2024, from $383.4 million as of June 30, 2024, resulting from the recategorization of $250.0 million of 18-month Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings with remaining maturities of less than one year to other borrowed funds during the third quarter of 2024. Long-term debt was relatively stable when compared to September 30, 2023, which increased $16.5 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. \n\nDebt we categorize as other borrowed funds is comprised of variable-rate, overnight and fixed-rate borrowings with remaining contractual tenors of up to one year through the Federal Home Loan Bank and Bank Term Funding Program. Other borrowed funds decreased $350.0 million, or 14.4%, to $2,080.0 million as of September 30, 2024, from $2,430.0 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease was funded by debt repayments supported by lower cash balances held at quarter end, lower recorded investment securities, and lower recorded loans, which was offset by the $250.0 million advance that moved from long-term debt. Other borrowed funds increased $13.0 million from September 30, 2023. \n\nThe Company is considered to be “well-capitalized” as of September 30, 2024, having exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company paid regular common stock dividends of approximately $49.1 million, or $0.47 per share. \n\n**CREDIT QUALITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, non-performing assets increased $4.0 million, or 2.3%, to $178.9 million, compared to $174.9 million as of June 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in non-accrual loans partially offset by the disposal of OREO properties. \n\nCriticized loans decreased $14.7 million, or 2.4%, to $603.3 million as of September 30, 2024, from $618.0 million as of June 30, 2024, driven primarily as a result of $22.1 million of charge-offs related to a commercial real estate loan and a construction real estate loan in the metro office portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by downgrades in the commercial, agricultural real estate, and commercial real estate portfolios. \n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, this press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to evaluate our performance relative to our capital adequacy standards: (i) tangible common stockholders’ equity; (ii) tangible assets; (iii) tangible book value per common share; (iv) tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets; (v) average tangible common stockholders’ equity; (vi) return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity; (vii) net FTE interest income; (viii) net FTE interest margin ratio; (ix) adjusted net FTE interest income; and (x) adjusted net FTE interest margin ratio. Tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as total common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Tangible assets are calculated as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Tangible book value per common share is calculated as tangible common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets is calculated as tangible common stockholders’ equity divided by tangible assets. Average tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as average total stockholders’ equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as annualized net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common stockholders’ equity. Net FTE interest income is calculated as net interest income, adjusted to include its FTE interest income. Net FTE interest margin ratio is calculated as net FTE interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Adjusted net FTE interest income is calculated as net FTE interest income less purchase accounting interest accretion on acquired loans. Adjusted net FTE interest margin ratio is calculated as annualized adjusted net FTE interest income divided by average interest earning assets. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. They also should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe Company adjusts the most directly comparable capital adequacy GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures described in subclauses (i) through (vi) above to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights), adjusts its GAAP net interest income to include fully taxable equivalent adjustments and further adjusts its net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to exclude purchase accounting interest accretion. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators and to present on a consistent basis our and our acquired companies’ organic continuing operations without regard to acquisition costs and other adjustments that we consider to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside our control, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance because, as a general matter, they either do not represent an actual cash expense and are inconsistent in amount and frequency depending upon the timing and size of our acquisitions (including the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which may drive the magnitude of acquisition related costs, but may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions or related costs), or they cannot be anticipated or estimated in a particular period (in particular as it relates to unexpected recovery amounts). This impacts the ratios that are important to analysts and allows investors to compare certain aspects of the Company’s capitalization to other companies. \n\nSee the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table included herein and the textual discussion for a reconciliation of the above-described non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties.

Reports Third Quarter Earnings\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\nBILLINGS, Mont.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--  First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIBK) (the “Company”) today reported financial results for the third quarter of 2024. For the quarter, the Company reported net income of $55.5 million, or $0.54 per share, which compares to net income of $60.0 million, or $0.58 per share, for the second quarter of 2024 and net income of $72.7 million, or $0.70 per share, for the third quarter of 2023. \n\n**HIGHLIGHTS**\n\n  * Appointed James A. Reuter as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective end of day November 1, 2024. \n  * Net interest margin increased to 3.01% for the third quarter of 2024, a 4-basis point increase from the second quarter of 2024. Net interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent (“FTE”) basis 1 , increased to 3.04% for the third quarter of 2024, or a 4-basis point increase from the second quarter of 2024. \n  * Criticized loans decreased $14.7 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $618.0 million at June 30, 2024, driven mostly by charge-offs. Net Charge-offs of $27.4 million or 0.60 basis points of average loans included a commercial real estate loan and a construction real estate loan in the metro office portfolio totaling $22.1 million. Net charge-offs within the remaining portfolio totaled $5.3 million or 0.12% of average loans. \n  * Total deposits decreased by $6.6 million at September 30, 2024 from June 30, 2024, driven by a large temporary deposit included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2024 that was withdrawn early in the third quarter; excluding the large temporary deposit, deposits increased approximately 1% at September 30, 2024 from June 30, 2024. \n  * Non-interest expense increased $2.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $1.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. Non-interest expense included $3.8 million related to the transition of the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer; excluding CEO transition expenses, non-interest expense decreased $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $5.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n  * Capital ratios continued to improve during the third quarter of 2024, with common equity tier 1 capital ratio increasing 0.30% to 11.83%, compared to the second quarter of 2024. \n\n\n\n“We were pleased to see continued improvement in our core operating metrics in the quarter. Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Income improved for the second consecutive quarter, and Net Interest Margin exceeded 3%, excluding purchase accounting, in the month of September. The Company continued to exert expense discipline, and fee businesses performed generally in-line with expectations. While there was charge-off activity this quarter within the metro-office portfolio, we believe notable losses in that portfolio are now behind us. Looking into 2025, the Company is well positioned to experience continued profitability expansion,” said Kevin P. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. \n\n____________ \n\n1 Represents a Non-GAAP Financial Measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included below for a reconciliation to this measure’s most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n\n**DIVIDEND DECLARATION**\n\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s board of directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share, payable on November 14, 2024, to common stockholders of record as of November 4, 2024. The dividend equates to a 6.3% annualized yield based on the $29.85 per share average closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on NASDAQ during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**NET INTEREST INCOME**\n\nNet interest income increased $3.8 million, or 1.9%, to $205.5 million, during the third quarter of 2024, compared to net interest income of $201.7 million during the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase in interest and fees on loans and a decrease in interest expense resulting from a decrease in average debt balances. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by higher costs of interest-bearing deposits during the third quarter of 2024. Net interest income decreased $8.2 million, or 3.8%, during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest expense resulting from higher costs of interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase in interest and fees on loans in the third quarter of 2024. \n\n  * Interest accretion attributable to the fair valuation of acquired loans from acquisitions contributed to net interest income during the third quarter of 2024, the second quarter of 2024, and the third quarter of 2023, in the amounts of $4.4 million, $5.1 million, and $5.2 million, respectively. \n\n\n\nThe net interest margin ratio was 3.01% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.97% during the second quarter of 2024, and 3.05% during the third quarter of 2023. The net FTE interest margin ratio 2 was 3.04% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.00% during the second quarter of 2024, and 3.07% during the third quarter of 2023. Excluding interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, the adjusted net interest margin ratio (FTE) 2 , was 2.97%, an increase of 5 basis points from the prior quarter, primarily driven by loan yield expansion and lower interest expense resulting from decreased borrowings. Excluding interest accretion from the fair value of acquired loans, on a year-over-year basis, the adjusted net interest margin ratio (FTE) decreased 3 basis points, primarily as a result of higher interest-bearing deposit costs, which was partially offset by loan yield expansion and a modestly favorable change in the mix of earning assets. \n\n___________ \n\n2 Represents a Non-GAAP Financial Measure. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures included below for a reconciliation to this measure’s most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n\n**PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES**\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a provision for credit losses of $19.8 million. This compares to a provision for credit losses of $9.0 million during the second quarter of 2024 and a reduction in the provision for credit losses of $0.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. \n\nFor the third quarter of 2024, the allowance for credit losses included net charge-offs of $27.4 million, or an annualized 0.60% of average loans outstanding, compared to net charge-offs of $13.5 million, or an annualized 0.30% of average loans outstanding, for the second quarter of 2024 and net charge-offs of $1.1 million, or an annualized 0.02% of average loans outstanding, for the third quarter of 2023. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were composed of charge-offs of $29.1 million, including a $15.9 million metro office commercial real estate loan and a $6.2 million metro office construction real estate loan, which were offset by recoveries of $1.7 million during the third quarter of 2024. As noted, metro office charge-offs were $22.1 million. Net charge-offs within the remaining portfolio totaled 0.12% of average loans in the third quarter of 2024. \n\nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loans held for investment was 1.25% at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.28% at June 30, 2024 and 1.24% at September 30, 2023. Coverage of non-performing loans decreased to 129.2% at September 30, 2024, compared to 138.4% at June 30, 2024 and 268.0% at September 30, 2023. \n\n**NON-INTEREST INCOME**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended** |  Sep 30, 2024  |  Jun 30, 2024  |  $ Change  |  % Change  |  Sep 30, 2023  |  $ Change  |  % Change   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in millions)_  \nPayment services revenues  |  $  |  18.7  |  $  |  18.6  |  $  |  0.1  |  0.5  |  %  |  $  |  19.2  |  $  |  (0.5  |  )  |  (2.6  |  )%   \nMortgage banking revenues  |  1.7  |  1.7  |  —  |  —  |  2.0  |  (0.3  |  )  |  (15.0  |  )   \nWealth management revenues  |  9.6  |  9.4  |  0.2  |  2.1  |  8.7  |  0.9  |  10.3   \nService charges on deposit accounts  |  6.6  |  6.4  |  0.2  |  3.1  |  6.0  |  0.6  |  10.0   \nOther service charges, commissions, and fees  |  2.2  |  2.1  |  0.1  |  4.8  |  2.2  |  —  |  —   \nOther income  |  7.6  |  4.4  |  3.2  |  72.7  |  3.9  |  3.7  |  94.9   \nTotal non-interest income  |  $  |  46.4  |  $  |  42.6  |  $  |  3.8  |  8.9  |  %  |  $  |  42.0  |  $  |  4.4  |  10.5  |  %   \n  \nNon-interest income was $46.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, increasing $3.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2024 and increasing $4.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The increases were primarily due to a recorded gain-on-sale of $2.6 million related to the sale of a branch during the third quarter of 2024. \n\n**NON-INTEREST EXPENSE**\n\n**For the Quarter Ended** |  Sep 30, 2024  |  Jun 30, 2024  |  $ Change  |  % Change  |  Sep 30, 2023  |  $ Change  |  % Change   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n_(Dollars in millions)_  \nSalaries and wages  |  $  |  70.9  |  $  |  66.3  |  $  |  4.6  |  6.9  |  %  |  $  |  65.4  |  $  |  5.5  |  8.4  |  %   \nEmployee benefits  |  19.7  |  16.9  |  2.8  |  16.6  |  19.7  |  —  |  —   \nOccupancy and equipment  |  17.0  |  16.9  |  0.1  |  0.6  |  17.0  |  —  |  —   \nOther intangible amortization  |  3.6  |  3.7  |  (0.1  |  )  |  (2.7  |  )  |  3.9  |  (0.3  |  )  |  (7.7  |  )   \nOther expenses  |  48.2  |  51.1  |  (2.9  |  )  |  (5.7  |  )  |  54.6  |  (6.4  |  )  |  (11.7  |  )   \nOther real estate owned expense  |  —  |  2.0  |  (2.0  |  )  |  (100.0  |  )  |  0.5  |  (0.5  |  )  |  (100.0  |  )   \nTotal non-interest expense  |  $  |  159.4  |  $  |  156.9  |  $  |  2.5  |  1.6  |  %  |  $  |  161.1  |  $  |  (1.7  |  )  |  (1.1  |  )%   \n  \nThe Company’s non-interest expense was $159.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of $2.5 million from the second quarter of 2024 and a decrease of $1.7 million from the third quarter of 2023. Expenses for the third quarter included $3.8 million related to the CEO transition. \n\nSalary and wages expense increased $4.6 million and $5.5 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023, respectively. The increase when compared to the second quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the accrual of $3.8 million related to the CEO transition and the increase when compared to the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the accrual of $3.8 million related to the CEO transition, lower deferred loan costs, and higher short-term incentive accruals, partially offset by lower severance costs and lower salaries and wages from expense reduction initiatives undertaken by the Company in 2023. \n\nEmployee benefit expenses increased $2.8 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million in health insurance costs. Employee benefit expenses were unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2023. \n\nOther expenses decreased $2.9 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to lower FDIC assessment fees and professional fees. Other expenses decreased $6.4 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily resulting from decreases in credit card reward accruals, professional fees, write-off of software costs, and reclassifications of new market tax credit amortization expenses, which moved to income tax expenses, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02. \n\nOther real estate owned expenses decreased $2.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $0.5 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to the write down of two commercial properties in the second quarter of 2024. \n\n**BALANCE SHEET**\n\nTotal assets decreased $694.0 million, or 2.3%, to $29,595.5 million as of September 30, 2024, from $30,289.5 million as of June 30, 2024, primarily due to decreases in loans, cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, and other assets. Total assets decreased $945.3 million, or 3.1%, from $30,540.8 million as of September 30, 2023, primarily due to decreases in investment securities, loans, and other assets which supported declines in deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements, which was partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. \n\nInvestment securities decreased $126.0 million, or 1.5%, to $8,275.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from $8,401.6 million as of June 30, 2024, primarily resulting from normal pay-downs and maturities, partially offset by a $158.5 million increase in fair market values of investment securities during the period. Investment securities decreased $611.6 million, or 6.9%, from $8,887.2 million as of September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from normal pay-downs and maturities, partially offset by a $330.8 million increase in fair market values during the period. \n\nThe following table presents the composition and comparison of loans held for investment as of the quarters-ended: \n\nSep 30, 2024  |  Jun 30, 2024  |  $ Change  |  % Change  |  Sep 30, 2023  |  $ Change  |  % Change   \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nReal Estate:   \nCommercial  |  $  |  9,219.3  |  $  |  9,054.5  |  $  |  164.8  |  1.8  |  %  |  $  |  8,766.2  |  $  |  453.1  |  5.2  |  %   \nConstruction  |  1,307.9  |  1,519.9  |  (212.0  |  )  |  (13.9  |  )  |  1,930.3  |  (622.4  |  )  |  (32.2  |  )   \nResidential  |  2,217.8  |  2,246.4  |  (28.6  |  )  |  (1.3  |  )  |  2,212.2  |  5.6  |  0.3   \nAgricultural  |  726.4  |  723.5  |  2.9  |  0.4  |  731.5  |  (5.1  |  )  |  (0.7  |  )   \nTotal real estate  |  13,471.4  |  13,544.3  |  (72.9  |  )  |  (0.5  |  )  |  13,640.2  |  (168.8  |  )  |  (1.2  |  )   \nConsumer:   \nIndirect  |  742.2  |  733.7  |  8.5  |  1.2  |  751.7  |  (9.5  |  )  |  (1.3  |  )   \nDirect and advance lines  |  136.9  |  139.0  |  (2.1  |  )  |  (1.5  |  )  |  142.3  |  (5.4  |  )  |  (3.8  |  )   \nCredit card  |  76.4  |  76.1  |  0.3  |  0.4  |  71.6  |  4.8  |  6.7   \nTotal consumer  |  955.5  |  948.8  |  6.7  |  0.7  |  965.6  |  (10.1  |  )  |  (1.0  |  )   \nCommercial  |  2,919.7  |  3,052.9  |  (133.2  |  )  |  (4.4  |  )  |  2,925.1  |  (5.4  |  )  |  (0.2  |  )   \nAgricultural  |  689.8  |  698.2  |  (8.4  |  )  |  (1.2  |  )  |  690.5  |  (0.7  |  )  |  (0.1  |  )   \nOther, including overdrafts  |  2.5  |  3.1  |  (0.6  |  )  |  (19.4  |  )  |  5.0  |  (2.5  |  )  |  (50.0  |  )   \nDeferred loan fees and costs  |  (11.8  |  )  |  (12.3  |  )  |  0.5  |  (4.1  |  )  |  (13.1  |  )  |  1.3  |  (9.9  |  )   \nLoans held for investment, net of deferred loan fees and costs  |  $  |  18,027.1  |  $  |  18,235.0  |  $  |  (207.9  |  )  |  (1.1  |  )%  |  $  |  18,213.3  |  $  |  (186.2  |  )  |  (1.0  |  )%   \n  \nDeclines in the construction real estate loans are primarily a result of the conversion of loans to permanent commercial real estate financing. Commercial loans declined due to both declines in draws of operating line and payoffs. \n\nThe ratio of loans held for investment to deposits was 78.8%, as of September 30, 2024, compared to 79.7% as of June 30, 2024 and 76.9% as of September 30, 2023. \n\nTotal deposits decreased modestly by $6.6 million to $22,864.1 million as of September 30, 2024, from $22,870.7 million as of June 30, 2024, with decreases in non-interest bearing deposits, which were partially offset by increases in all interest-bearing categories. The decrease in total deposits was largely influenced by a large temporary deposit included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2024 which was withdrawn early in the third quarter. Total deposits decreased $815.4 million, or 3.4%, from $23,679.5 million as of September 30, 2023, with decreases in all types of deposits except for demand and savings deposits. Securities sold under repurchase agreements decreased $184.6 million, or 24.9%, to $557.2 million as of September 30, 2024, from $741.8 million as of June 30, 2024, and decreased $332.3 million, or 37.4%, from $889.5 million as of September 30, 2023, resulting from normal fluctuations in the liquidity needs of the Company’s clients. \n\nLong-term debt decreased $246.1 million, or 64.2%, to $137.3 million as of September 30, 2024, from $383.4 million as of June 30, 2024, resulting from the recategorization of $250.0 million of 18-month Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings with remaining maturities of less than one year to other borrowed funds during the third quarter of 2024. Long-term debt was relatively stable when compared to September 30, 2023, which increased $16.5 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. \n\nDebt we categorize as other borrowed funds is comprised of variable-rate, overnight and fixed-rate borrowings with remaining contractual tenors of up to one year through the Federal Home Loan Bank and Bank Term Funding Program. Other borrowed funds decreased $350.0 million, or 14.4%, to $2,080.0 million as of September 30, 2024, from $2,430.0 million as of June 30, 2024. The decrease was funded by debt repayments supported by lower cash balances held at quarter end, lower recorded investment securities, and lower recorded loans, which was offset by the $250.0 million advance that moved from long-term debt. Other borrowed funds increased $13.0 million from September 30, 2023. \n\nThe Company is considered to be “well-capitalized” as of September 30, 2024, having exceeded all regulatory capital adequacy requirements. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company paid regular common stock dividends of approximately $49.1 million, or $0.47 per share. \n\n**CREDIT QUALITY**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, non-performing assets increased $4.0 million, or 2.3%, to $178.9 million, compared to $174.9 million as of June 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in non-accrual loans partially offset by the disposal of OREO properties. \n\nCriticized loans decreased $14.7 million, or 2.4%, to $603.3 million as of September 30, 2024, from $618.0 million as of June 30, 2024, driven primarily as a result of $22.1 million of charge-offs related to a commercial real estate loan and a construction real estate loan in the metro office portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by downgrades in the commercial, agricultural real estate, and commercial real estate portfolios. \n\n**NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**\n\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, this press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures that management uses to evaluate our performance relative to our capital adequacy standards: (i) tangible common stockholders’ equity; (ii) tangible assets; (iii) tangible book value per common share; (iv) tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets; (v) average tangible common stockholders’ equity; (vi) return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity; (vii) net FTE interest income; (viii) net FTE interest margin ratio; (ix) adjusted net FTE interest income; and (x) adjusted net FTE interest margin ratio. Tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as total common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Tangible assets are calculated as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Tangible book value per common share is calculated as tangible common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets is calculated as tangible common stockholders’ equity divided by tangible assets. Average tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as average total stockholders’ equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as annualized net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common stockholders’ equity. Net FTE interest income is calculated as net interest income, adjusted to include its FTE interest income. Net FTE interest margin ratio is calculated as net FTE interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Adjusted net FTE interest income is calculated as net FTE interest income less purchase accounting interest accretion on acquired loans. Adjusted net FTE interest margin ratio is calculated as annualized adjusted net FTE interest income divided by average interest earning assets. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. They also should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. \n\nThe Company adjusts the most directly comparable capital adequacy GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures described in subclauses (i) through (vi) above to exclude goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights), adjusts its GAAP net interest income to include fully taxable equivalent adjustments and further adjusts its net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to exclude purchase accounting interest accretion. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures, which are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators and to present on a consistent basis our and our acquired companies’ organic continuing operations without regard to acquisition costs and other adjustments that we consider to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside our control, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance because, as a general matter, they either do not represent an actual cash expense and are inconsistent in amount and frequency depending upon the timing and size of our acquisitions (including the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which may drive the magnitude of acquisition related costs, but may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions or related costs), or they cannot be anticipated or estimated in a particular period (in particular as it relates to unexpected recovery amounts). This impacts the ratios that are important to analysts and allows investors to compare certain aspects of the Company’s capitalization to other companies. \n\nSee the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table included herein and the textual discussion for a reconciliation of the above-described non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results**\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Rule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated thereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Any statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, beliefs, or future performance or events constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are identified by words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “trends,” “objectives,” “continues” or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “may,” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other important factors that change over time and could cause actual results to differ materially from any results, performance or events expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the following factors, among others, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations in the forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this press release: \n\n  * new or changes in existing, governmental regulations; \n  * negative developments in the banking industry and increased regulatory scrutiny; \n  * tax legislative initiatives or assessments; \n  * more stringent capital requirements, to the extent they may become applicable to us; \n  * changes in accounting standards; \n  * any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, the Office of Foreign Asset Control guidelines and requirements, the Bank Secrecy Act, and the related Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Guidelines and regulations; \n  * federal deposit insurance increases; \n  * lending risks and risks associated with loan sector concentrations; \n  * a decline in economic conditions that could reduce demand for our products and services and negatively impact the credit quality of loans; \n  * loan credit losses exceeding estimates; \n  * exposure to losses in collateralized loan obligation securities; \n  * changes to United States trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs; \n  * the soundness of other financial institutions; \n  * the ability to meet cash flow needs and availability of financing sources for working capital and other needs; \n  * a loss of deposits or a change in product mix that increases the Company’s funding costs; \n  * inability to access funding or to monetize liquid assets; \n  * changes in interest rates; \n  * interest rate effect on the value of our investment securities; \n  * cybersecurity risks, including “denial-of-service attacks,” “hacking,” and “identity theft” that could result in the disclosure of confidential information; \n  * privacy, information security, and data protection laws, rules, and regulations that affect or limit how we collect and use personal information; \n  * the potential impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets; \n  * our reliance on other companies that provide key components of our business infrastructure; \n  * events that may tarnish our reputation; \n  * main stream and social media contagion; \n  * the loss of the services of key members of our management team and directors; \n  * our ability to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business; \n  * costs associated with repossessed properties, including environmental remediation; \n  * the effectiveness of our systems of internal operating and accounting controls; \n  * our ability to implement technology-facilitated products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients; \n  * difficulties we may face in combining the operations of acquired entities or assets with our own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter into strategic contractual relationships; \n  * competition from new or existing financial institutions and non-banks; \n  * investing in technology; \n  * incurrence of significant costs related to mergers and related integration activities; \n  * the volatility in the price and trading volume of our common stock; \n  * “anti-takeover” provisions in our certificate of incorporation and regulations, which may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even in circumstances that could be deemed beneficial to stockholders; \n  * changes in our dividend policy or our ability to pay dividends; \n  * our common stock not being an insured deposit; \n  * the potential dilutive effect of future equity issuances; \n  * the subordination of our common stock to our existing and future indebtedness; \n  * the impact of the combined deficiencies resulting in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; \n  * the effect of global conditions, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, floods, fires, drought, and other natural catastrophic events; and \n  * the impact of climate change and environmental sustainability matters. \n\n\n\nThese factors are not necessarily all the factors that could cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. \n\nAll forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above and included and described in more detail in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under the caption “Risk Factors.” Interested parties are urged to read in their entirety such risk factors prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Company.

Any statements about our plans, objectives, expectations,\nstrategies, beliefs, or future performance or events constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are identified by words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,”\n“trends,” “objectives,” “continues”, “projected”, or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “may” or similar expressions. Forward-\nlooking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any results,\nperformance or events expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nThe following factors, among others, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations in the forward-looking statements, including those set forth in this presentation: new or\nchanges in existing, governmental regulations; negative developments in the banking industry and increased regulatory scrutiny; tax legislative initiatives or assessments; more stringent capital\nrequirements, to the extent they may become applicable to us; changes in accounting standards; any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the\nCommunity Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, the Office of Foreign Asset Control guidelines and requirements, the Bank Secrecy Act, and the related Financial\nCrimes Enforcement Network and Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Guidelines and regulations; federal deposit insurance increases; lending risks and risks associated with loan sector\nconcentrations; a decline in economic conditions that could reduce demand for our products and services and negatively impact the credit quality of loans; loan credit losses exceeding estimates;\nexposure to losses in collateralized loan obligation securities; changes to United States trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs; the soundness of other financial\ninstitutions; the ability to meet cash flow needs and availability of financing sources for working capital and other needs; a loss of deposits or a change in product mix that increases the Company’s\nfunding costs; inability to access funding or to monetize liquid assets; changes in interest rates; interest rate effect on the value of our investment securities; cybersecurity risks, including “denial-of-\nservice attacks,” “hacking,” and “identity theft” that could result in the disclosure of confidential information; privacy, information security, and data protection laws, rules, and regulations that\naffect or limit how we collect and use personal information; the potential impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets; our reliance on other companies that provide key components of our\nbusiness infrastructure; events that may tarnish our reputation; main stream and social media contagion; the loss of the services of key members of our management team and directors; our ability to\nattract and retain qualified employees to operate our business; costs associated with repossessed properties, including environmental remediation; the effectiveness of our systems of internal\noperating and accounting controls; our ability to implement technology-facilitated products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients; difficulties we may\nface in combining the operations of acquired entities or assets with our own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter into\nstrategic contractual relationships; competition from new or existing financial institutions and non-banks; investing in technology; incurrence of significant costs related to mergers and related\nintegration activities; the volatility in the price and trading volume of our common stock; “anti-takeover” provisions in our certificate of incorporation and regulations, which may make it more\ndifficult for a third party to acquire control of us even in circumstances that could be deemed beneficial to stockholders; changes in our dividend policy or our ability to pay dividends; our common\nstock not being an insured deposit; the potential dilutive effect of future equity issuances; the subordination of our common stock to our existing and future indebtedness; the impact of the combined\ndeficiencies resulting in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; the effect of global conditions, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, floods, fires, drought, and other natural\ncatastrophic events; and the impact of climate change and environmental sustainability matters.\nThe foregoing factors are not necessarily all of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of our\nforward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.\nAll forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above and included in our periodic\nreports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, under the caption “Risk Factors”.

(ii)\ntangible assets; (iii) tangible book value per common share; (iv) tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets;(v) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent\nbasis; (vi) adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis; (vii) net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis; and (viii) adjusted net interest margin on\na fully taxable equivalent basis. Tangible common stockholders’ equity is calculated as total common stockholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding\nmortgage servicing rights). Tangible assets are calculated as total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights). Tangible book value per\ncommon share is calculated as tangible common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible common stockholders’ equity to tangible assets is\ncalculated as tangible common stockholders’ equity divided by tangible assets. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis is calculated as net interest income,\nadjusted to include its fully taxable equivalent interest income. Adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis is calculated as net interest income on a fully\ntaxable equivalent basis less purchase accounting interest accretion on acquired loans. Net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis is calculated as annualized net\ninterest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets. Adjusted net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis is calculated as\nannualized adjusted net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis divided by average interest-earning assets. These non-GAAP financial measures are calculated on the\nreconciliation pages that follow). These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because other companies\nmay not calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. They also should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with\nGAAP.\nThe Company adjusts the most directly comparable capital adequacy GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures described in subclauses (i) through (iv) above\nto exclude goodwill and other intangible assets (except mortgage servicing rights), adjusts its GAAP net interest income to include fully taxable equivalent adjustments and\nfurther adjusts its net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis to exclude purchase accounting interest accretion. Management believes these non-GAAP financial\nmeasures, which are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators and are intended to present on a consistent basis our and our acquired companies’\norganic continuing operations without regard to the acquisition costs and adjustments that we consider to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that\nare outside our control, are useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance because, as a general matter, they either do not represent an actual cash expense and\nare inconsistent in amount and frequency depending upon the timing and size of our acquisitions (including the size, complexity and/or volume of past acquisitions, which may\ndrive the magnitude of acquisition related costs, but may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of future acquisitions or related costs), or they cannot be\nanticipated or estimated in a particular period (in particular as it relates to unexpected recovery amounts). This impacts the ratios that are important to analysts and allows\ninvestors to compare certain aspects of the Company’s capitalization to other companies.\nSee the Non-GAAP Financial Measures tables included below and the textual discussion for a reconciliation of the above described non-GAAP financial measures to their most\ndirectly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n17\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal common stockholders' equity (GAAP) (A) $ 3,085.5 $ 3,227.5 $ 3,209.7 $ 3,225.3 $ 3,365.8\nLess goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage\nservicing rights) 1,214.1 1,210.3 1,206.6 1,202.9 1,199.3\nTangible common stockholders' equity (Non-GAAP) (B) $ 1,871.4 $ 2,017.2 $ 2,003.1 $ 2,022.4 $ 2,166.5\nTotal assets (GAAP) $ 30,540.8 $ 30,671.2 $ 30,144.8 $ 30,289.5 $ 29,595.5\nLess goodwill and other intangible assets (excluding mortgage\nservicing rights) 1,214.1 1,210.3 1,206.6 1,202.9 1,199.3\nTangible assets (Non-GAAP) (C) $ 29,326.7 $ 29,460.9 $ 28,938.2 $ 29,086.6 $ 28,396.2\nCommon shares outstanding (L) 105,011 103,942 104,572 104,561 104,530\nBook value per common share (GAAP) (A) / (L) $ 29.38 $ 31.05 $ 30.69 $ 30.85 $ 32.20\nTangible book value per common share (Non-GAAP) (B) / (L) 17.82 19.41 19.16 19.34 20.73\nTangible common stockholders' equity to tangible assets (Non-GAAP) (B) / (C) 6.38 % 6.85 % 6.92 % 6.95 % 7.63 %\n* Line items may not sum due to rounding\n18\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n3Q23 4Q23 1Q24 2Q24 3Q24\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet interest income (A) $ 213.7 $ 207.8 $ 200.1 $ 201.7 $ 205.5\nFTE adjustments(1) 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.7 1.6\nNet interest income on a FTE basis (Non-GAAP) (B) 215.4 209.5 201.8 203.4 207.1\nLess purchase accounting accretion 5.2 5.4 6.5 5.1 4.4\nAdjusted net interest income on a FTE basis\n(Non-GAAP) (C) $ 210.2 $ 204.1 $ 195.3 $ 198.3 $ 202.7\nAverage interest-earning assets (D) $ 27,796.8 $ 27,569.4 $ 27,699.6 $ 27,286.9 $ 27,133.3\nNet interest margin (A annualized)/(D) 3.05 % 2.99 % 2.91 % 2.97 % 3.01 %\nNet interest margin (FTE) (Non-GAAP) (B annualized)/(D) 3.07 3.01 2.93 3.00 3.04\nAdjusted net interest margin (FTE) (Non-GAAP) (C annualized)/(D) 3.00 2.94 2.84 2.92 2.97\n* Line items may not sum due to rounding\n1 Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s performance as a comparison of the returns between a tax-free investment and a taxable alternative.

The allowance for credit losses is\nmeasured as the amount by which an investment security’s amortized cost exceeds the net present value of expected future cash flows. However, the\namount of credit losses for available-for-sale investment securities is limited to the amount of a security’s unrealized loss. The allowance for credit loss on\nheld-to-maturity investment securities is representative of current expected credit losses that management expects to be incurred over the life of the\ninvestment and established through a charge to provision for credit losses in current period earnings. For held-to-maturity investment securities, the\nCompany has the intent and ability to hold these investment securities to maturity.\nThe investment securities portfolio primarily contains securities that are guaranteed by a sovereign entity or are generally considered to have non-credit\nrelated risks, such as interest rate risk or liquidity factors. The Company considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its\nagencies and whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred.\n12\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

In some cases, these modifications may result in\nnew loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an\nother-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension, or a combination thereof, among other things.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans, by class and by type of modification, at September 30, 2024 and 2023 that were both\nexperiencing financial difficulty and modified during the periods indicated.

Of the loans that were modified during the twelve-months ended September 30, 2024, there were $0.5 million of loans classified as\npast due 30 days or more, with the remaining loans performing in accordance with the modified terms and classified as current at September 30, 2024.\nThere were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose terms were modified during the three months\nended September 30, 2024 through either principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, term extension, or other than insignificant payment delay.\nThere were $1.3 million of payment defaults on these loans subsequent to their modifications during the twelve-months ended September 30, 2024. The\nCompany considers a payment default to occur when the loan is 90 days or more past due or the loan is placed on non-accrual status after the\nmodification. The Company monitors the performance of modified loans on an ongoing basis. In the event of subsequent default, the allowance for credit\nlosses continues to be reassessed based on an individual evaluation of each loan. The modifications made during the periods presented did not\nsignificantly impact the Company’s determination of the allowance for credit losses.\n21\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of the on-going and continuous monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio, management tracks internally assigned risk\nclassifications of loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. The factors considered by the Company include,\namong other factors, the borrower’s current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current\neconomic trends. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the credit risk of the loans. This analysis generally includes loans with an\noutstanding balance greater than $1.0 million, which are generally considered non-homogeneous loans, such as commercial loans and commercial real\nestate loans. This analysis is performed no less than on an annual basis, depending upon the size of exposure and the contractual obligations governing\nthe borrower’s financial reporting frequency. Homogeneous loans, including small business loans, are typically monitored by payment performance. The\nCompany internally risk rates its loans in accordance with a Uniform Classification System developed jointly by the various bank regulatory agencies.\nThe Uniform Classification System defines three broad categories of criticized assets, which the Company uses as credit quality indicators in addition to\nthe 6 Pass ratings in its 10-point rating scale:\nSpecial Mention — includes loans that exhibit a potential weakness in financial condition, loan structure, or documentation that warrants management’s\nclose attention. If not promptly corrected, the potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the\ninstitution’s credit position at some future date.\nSubstandard — includes loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower which have well-defined\nweaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Although the primary source of repayment for a substandard loan may not currently be sufficient,\ncollateral or other sources of repayment are sufficient to satisfy the debt. Continuance of a substandard loan is not warranted unless positive steps are\ntaken to improve the worthiness of the credit.\nDoubtful — includes loans that exhibit pronounced weaknesses based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values to a point where collection or\nliquidation for full repayment is highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful loans are required to be placed on non-accrual status and are assigned\nspecific loss exposure.\nLoans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above-described process are considered pass-rated loans.\n22\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

The Company had $1.7 million and $0.5 million recorded investments in consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate for\nwhich formal foreclosure proceedings were in process of foreclosure as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n26\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\n(6) Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its\nexposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through the management of its business activities. The Company manages economic risks,\nincluding interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and derivative\nfinancial instruments. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts to manage or hedge exposures that\narise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by\ninterest rates and interest rate exposures. The Company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company sells residential mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis. The Company mitigates the effect of the interest rate\nrisk inherent in providing interest rate lock commitments by entering into forward loan sales contracts. The forward loan sales contracts are recorded at\nfair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value component\nassociated with the projected cash flows from the loan delivery to the investor, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the\ninterest rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these\nvaluations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. When the loan is funded to the borrower, the interest rate lock\ncommitment derivative expires, and the Company records a loan held for sale. The forward loan sales contract acts as a hedge against the variability in\ncash to be received from the loan sale. The changes in measurement of the estimated fair values of the interest rate lock commitments and forward loan\nsales contracts are included in mortgage banking revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company also enters into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative contracts relate to\ntransactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a client while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with\na third-party financial institution. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for the client, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative\ncontracts primarily offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company’s results of operations.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income (expense) and to manage its exposure to interest rate\nmovements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management\nstrategy.\nAs part of the Company’s overall asset and liability management strategy, in 2022 the Company entered into two interest rate collars related to variable-\nrate loans that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $300.0 million and entered into four swaps, two of which were related\nto variable-rate loans and two that were related to variable-rate securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of\n$850.0 million. The collars designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fix the interest income received by the Company when the interest index falls\nbelow a floor rate on a rate reset and when the interest index exceeds the cap rate on a rate reset. Each of the swaps designated as cash flow hedges\nsynthetically fixes the interest income received by the Company.\nDuring the quarter, the Company voluntarily terminated three swaps, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and one related to variable-rate\nsecurities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $550.0 million. The termination of the cash flow hedges resulted in a\nnet loss of $0.2 million being captured in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassified to interest income over the period the\nforecasted transactions affects earnings.\nThe two interest rate collars and one remaining swap designated as cash flow hedges were effective with a total notional amount of $600.0 million.\nFor derivatives that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated\nother comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest income in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects\nearnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified as interest income when interest\npayments on the Company’s hedged items are earned. During the next twelve months, based on implied forward curves, the Company estimates that $1.7\nmillion will be reclassified to interest income.\n27\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The Company uses interest rate\nswaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments attributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate\nswaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate\npayments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company\nterminated the $200.0 million, three-year forward starting, four-year pay fixed interest rate swap, resulting in a $8.5 million gain that will be accreted into\nincome through July 2028 or until the securities are sold. The Company accreted $0.4 million of the gain into interest income during the three months\nended September 30, 2024.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item\nattributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.\nThe following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges for the periods\nindicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nCumulative Amount of Cumulative Amount of\nCarrying Amount of the Fair Value Hedging Carrying Amount of the Fair Value Hedging\nHedged Assets/(Liabilities) Adjustment Hedged Assets/(Liabilities) Adjustment\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ 194.3 $ 5.7 $ 193.3 $ 6.7\nNon-designated Hedge Derivatives\nDerivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The\nCompany executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate\nswaps are simultaneously economically hedged by offsetting derivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes\nits net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting\nrequirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting derivatives are recognized directly in earnings.\nRisk Participation Agreements\nThe Company acquired, from Great Western Bank, risk participation agreements under which it assumes credit risk associated with a borrower’s\nperformance related to derivative contracts. The Company only entered into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Company\nwas also a party to the related loan participation agreements for such borrowers. The Company manages its credit risk under risk participation agreements\nby monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrower, based on its normal credit review process.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis for the periods indicated. The derivative asset and\nliability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, but after the variation\nmargin payments with central clearing organizations have been applied as settlement, as applicable. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to\naccount for the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net\nbasis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements\nis not offset on the consolidated balance sheets.\n28\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

However, the Company manages its capital position as if the requirements\napply to the consolidated company and has presented the ratios as if they also applied on a consolidated basis.\nIn connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company recognized an after-tax cumulative effect on retained earnings with a\nreduction totaling $24.1 million. In March 2020, the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and\nthe FDIC issued an interim final rule that allows banking organizations to mitigate the effects of ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASC 326”) on their regulatory capital computations. This interim rule is in\naddition to the three-year transition period already in place under the capital transition rule previously issued in February 2019. Banking organizations can\nelect to mitigate the estimated cumulative effects on regulatory capital for an additional two years. This rule allows an institution to defer incorporating\nthe impact of ASC 326 into its regulatory capital calculation, including ratios, over an extended period. Additionally, the interim rule extends the\ntransition period whereby an institution can defer the impact from ASC 326 on the current period, determined based on the difference between the new\nASC 326 allowance for credit losses and the allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss method from previous GAAP, for up to two years. The total\nimpact related to ASC 326 would then be transitioned into regulatory capital and the associated ratios over a three-year transition period, beginning after\nthe initial two-year deferral period, for a total transition period of five years. The Company elected to opt into the transition election and adopted\ntransition relief over the permissible five-year period.\n(11) Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various claims and litigation. The Company establishes accruals for legal matters when\npotential losses associated with the actions become probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There is no assurance that the ultimate\nresolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the amounts that the Company has accrued. Accruals for legal matters are based on management’s\nbest judgment after consultation with counsel and others. In the opinion of management, following consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate liability\nor disposition of all such claims and litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of\noperations, or liquidity of the Company.\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments under construction contracts of $5.5 million.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nResidential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market are sold with varying recourse provisions. Essentially all the loan sales agreements\nrequire the repurchase of a mortgage loan by the seller in situations such as breach of representation, warranty, or covenant; untimely document delivery;\nfalse or misleading statements; failure to obtain certain certificates or insurance; or unmarketability. Certain loan sales agreements contain repurchase\nrequirements based on payment-related defects that are defined in terms of the number of days or months since the purchase, the sequence number of the\npayment, and/or the number of days of payment delinquency. Based on the specific terms stated in the agreements, the Company had $0.7 million of sold\nresidential mortgage loans with recourse provisions still in effect as of September 30, 2024.\n(12) Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet the financing needs of its clients.\nThese financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements\nof credit and interest rate risk in excess of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a\nclient so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire\nwithout being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional\ncommitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is\nessentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to clients. The Company’s policy for obtaining collateral, and determining the\nnature of such collateral, is essentially the same as in the Company’s policies for making commitments to extend credit. The estimated fair value of the\nobligation undertaken by the Company in issuing standby letters of credit is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Company’s\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents our financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, as well as the activity in the allowance for off-balance sheet credit\nlosses related to those financial instruments:\nThree Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 5.8 $ 20.8 $ 18.4 $ 16.2\nProvision for credit loss expense (0.2) (2.0) (12.8) 2.6\nEnding balance $ 5.6 $ 18.8 $ 5.6 $ 18.8\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nUnused credit card lines $ 861.4 $ 814.0\nCommitments to extend credit 3,290.7 4,069.2\nStandby letters of credit 88.7 97.1\n(13) Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe gross amounts of each component of other comprehensive loss and the related tax effects are as follows:\nPre-tax Tax (Expense) Benefit Net of Tax\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023\nInvestment securities available-for sale:\nChange in net unrealized gains (losses) during the period $ 158.5 $ (72.1) $ (39.4)$ 17.9 $ 119.1 $ (54.2)\nNet change in unamortized losses on available-for-sale investment\nsecurities transferred into held-to-maturity (0.2) (0.3) — 0.1 (0.2) (0.2)\nCash flow hedge:\nChange in unrealized gains (losses) on derivatives 12.4 (13.1) (3.0) 3.2 9.4 (9.9)\nReclassification adjustment for derivatives net losses included in\nincome 3.1 2.1 (0.8) (0.5) 2.3 1.6\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss) $ 173.8 $ (83.4) $ (43.2)$ 20.7 $ 130.6 $ (62.7)\n35\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

There is a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the\nuse of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nThe three levels of inputs to measure fair value are as follows:\n• Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not\nactive; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities\n• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities\nThe methodologies used by the Company in determining the fair values of each class of financial instruments are based primarily on independent, market-\nbased data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, and\ntherefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques as of September 30,\n2024.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the end of the reporting period. Transfers in and out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3\nare recognized on the actual transfer date. There were no significant transfers between fair value hierarchy levels as of September 30, 2024.\n36\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nFurther details on the methods used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments above are discussed below:\nInvestment Debt Securities Available-for-Sale. The Company obtains fair value measurements for investment securities from an independent pricing\nservice. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve,\nlive trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the investment’s terms and conditions, among\nothers. Vendors chosen by the Company are widely recognized vendors whose evaluations support the pricing functions of financial institutions,\ninvestment and mutual funds, and portfolio managers. If needed, a broker may be utilized to determine the reported fair value of investment securities.\nLoans Held for Sale. Fair value measurements for residential mortgage loans held for sale are obtained from an independent pricing service. The fair\nvalue measurements consider observable data that may include binding contracts or quotes or bids from third party investors as well as loan level pricing\nadjustments. Commercial and agricultural loans held for sale are derived from quotes or bids from third party investors.\nInterest Rate Collars: The fair values of interest rate collars are obtained from an independent third party. The values are determined using the market\nstandard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates fell below (rise above) the strike rate of\nthe floors (caps). The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the collars are based on an expectation of future interest rates\nderived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The Company also compares the reasonableness of the pricing quarterly through a\nvalidation process involving additional independent third parties.\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts. Fair values for derivative interest rate swap contracts are obtained from an independent third party. The values are based\nupon the estimated amounts to settle the contracts considering current interest rates and are calculated using discounted cash flows that are observable, or\nthat can be corroborated by observable market data. The inputs used to determine fair value include the United States Dollar – Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (“SOFR”) forward curve to estimate variable rate cash inflows and SOFR to estimate the discount rate. The estimated variable rate cash\ninflows are compared to the fixed rate outflows and such difference is discounted to a present value to estimate the fair value of the interest rate swaps.\nThe Company also compares the reasonableness of the pricing quarterly through a validation process involving additional independent third parties.\nFor purposes of potential valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate both our credit risk and the credit risk of our counterparties.\nAccordingly, we have considered factors such as the likelihood of our default and the default of our counterparties, our net exposures and remaining\ncontractual life, among other things, in determining if any fair value adjustments related to credit risk are required. The change in value of derivative\nassets and derivative liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during the reported periods.\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments. Fair value measurements for interest rate lock commitments are obtained from an independent pricing service. The fair\nvalue measurements consider observable data that may include prices available from secondary market investors taking into consideration various\ncharacteristics of the loan, including the loan amount, interest rate, value of the servicing, and loan to value ratio, among other things. Observable data is\nthen adjusted to reflect changes in interest rates, the Company’s estimated pull-through rate, and estimated direct costs necessary to complete the\ncommitment into a closed loan net of origination, and processing fees collected from the borrower.\nForward Loan Sales Contracts. The fair value measurements for forward loan sales contracts are obtained from an independent pricing service. The fair\nvalue measurements consider observable data that includes sales of similar loans.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities. The fair values of deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities are based primarily on the use of\nindependent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. These investments are in the same funds and purchased in the same amounts as the participants’ selected investments, which represent\nthe underlying liabilities to plan participants. Deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of\nparticipants’ selected investments.\n37\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nCollateral-dependent Loans. Collateral-dependent loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from\ncollateral. The collateral-dependent loans are reported at fair value through specific valuation allowance allocations. In addition, when it is determined\nthat the fair value of a collateral-dependent loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the carrying value of the loan is adjusted to fair value\nthrough a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Collateral values are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current\nmarket conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had collateral-dependent loans with a carrying and fair value of\n$109.6 million and $52.6 million, respectively.\nLoans Held for Sale. Fair value measurements for non-residential mortgage loans held for sale are derived from valuations, appraisals, and quotes or bids\nfrom third party investors. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include binding contracts or quotes or bids from third party\ninvestors as well as loan level pricing adjustments.\nOREO. The fair values of OREO are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. Upon initial\nrecognition, write-downs based on the foreclosed asset’s fair value at foreclosure are reported through charges to the allowance for credit losses.\nPeriodically, the fair value of foreclosed assets is remeasured with any subsequent write-downs charged to OREO expense in the period in which they are\nidentified.\nLong-lived Assets to be Disposed of by Sale. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less\nestimated costs to sell. The fair values of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are based upon observable market data and management estimates of\ncurrent market conditions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale with carrying\nand fair values aggregating $1.0 million.\nThe following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and for which the Company\nhas utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair values:\nFair Value As of\nSeptember 30, December 31, Valuation Unobservable Range\n2024 2023 Technique Inputs (Weighted Average)\nCollateral-dependent loans $ 109.6 $ 52.6 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 0% - 71% (41%)\nDiscount for type of property,\nFair value of age of appraisal, and current\nLoans held for sale 18.8 46.9 collateral status 0 - 28 (24)\nOther real estate owned 4.4 16.5 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 17 - 40 (23)\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of by\nsale 1.0 1.0 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 0 - 0 0\nThe Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate fair value. The methodologies for\nestimating the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. The\nmethodologies for estimating the fair value of other financial instruments are discussed below. For financial instruments bearing a variable interest rate\nwhere no credit risk exists, it is presumed that recorded book values are reasonable estimates of fair value.\nFinancial Assets. Carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, and accrued interest receivable approximate fair values due to the liquid and/or short-term\nnature of these instruments. Fair values for investment securities held-to-maturity are obtained from an independent pricing service, which considers\nobservable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market\nconsensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the investment’s terms and conditions, among other things. Fair values of fixed rate loans and\nvariable rate loans that reprice on an infrequent basis are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans\nwith similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality using an exit price notion. Carrying values of variable rate loans that reprice\nfrequently, and with no change in credit risk, approximate the fair values of these instruments.\n40\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nFinancial Liabilities. The fair values of demand deposits, savings accounts, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and accrued interest payable are\nthe amounts that are payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using external market\nrates that are currently offered for deposits that have similar remaining maturities. The fair values of derivative liabilities are obtained from an\nindependent pricing service, which considers observable data that may include the United States Dollar – SOFR forward curve, the federal funds effective\nswap rate and cash flows, among other things. The fixed and floating rate subordinated debentures, floating rate subordinated term loan, other borrowed\nfunds, fixed rate subordinated term debt, and capital lease obligation are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates for advances that\nhave similar characteristics.\nCommitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, based on fees\ncurrently charged to enter into similar agreements, is not significant.\nThe estimated fair values of financial instruments that are reported in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and are segregated by the level of the\nvaluation inputs within the fair value hierarchy that are utilized to measure fair value, are as follows:\nFair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using\nQuoted Prices in Significant Other Significant\nActive Markets for Observable Unobservable\nCarrying Estimated Identical Assets Inputs Inputs\nAs of September 30, 2024 Amount Fair Value (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nFinancial assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 698.6 $ 698.6 $ 698.6 $ — $ —\nInvestment debt securities held-to-maturity 2,741.3 2,480.5 — 2,480.5 —\nAccrued interest receivable 127.3 127.3 — 127.3 —\nMortgage servicing rights, net 26.3 37.2 — 37.2 —\nLoans held for sale 20.9 20.9 — 2.1 18.8\nNet loans held for investment 17,801.7 17,257.5 — 17,147.9 109.6\nTotal financial assets $ 21,416.1 $ 20,622.0 $ 698.6 $ 19,795.0 $ 128.4\nFinancial liabilities:\nTotal deposits, excluding time deposits $ 19,985.9 $ 19,985.9 $ 19,985.9 $ — $ —\nTime deposits 2,878.2 2,864.3 — 2,864.3 —\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements 557.2 557.2 — 557.2 —\nOther borrowed funds 2,080.0 2,080.0 — 2,080.0 —\nAccrued interest payable 87.7 87.7 — 87.7 —\nLong-term debt 137.3 132.1 — 132.1 —\nSubordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts 163.1 151.0 — 151.0 —\nTotal financial liabilities $ 25,889.4 $ 25,858.2 $ 19,985.9 $ 5,872.3 $ —\n41\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

Previously, this method was only available for qualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures.\nThe amendments also require that a reporting entity disclose certain information in annual and interim reporting periods that enable investors to\nunderstand certain information about its investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program. For public\nbusiness entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nThe Amendments in this ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2024. The Company elected the modified retrospective approach for\nqualifying New Market Tax Credits and adjusted beginning retained earnings by an increase of $1.2 million related to the previously recorded deferred\ntaxes. Prospectively, both the amortization of the investment in Low Income Housing Tax Credits and the New Market Tax Credits are recorded net\nwithin income tax expense.\nASU 2023-06, “Disclosure Improvements—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative” In\nOctober 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements—Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC’s Disclosure Update and\nSimplification Initiative that amends the ASC to incorporate certain disclosure requirements from SEC Release No. 33-10532 - Disclosure Update and\nSimplification that was issued in 2018. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC’s removal of that related disclosure\nfrom Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2023-\n06 will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-\n07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to improve disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced\ndisclosures about significant segment expenses. This update does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments; however, it does\nrequire that an entity that has single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update. The amendments in this\nupdate are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. A\npublic entity should apply the amendments in this update retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company currently has one reportable operating segment, Community Banking. This ASU will not impact the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements and will have minimal impact to the disclosures, requiring identification of the chief operating decision maker and the\ninformation used to make operating decisions and to allocate resources.\nASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income\nTaxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures that require public business entities to annually disclose (1) specific categories in their rate\nreconciliation; (2) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold; (3) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds\nreceived) disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes; (4) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual\njurisdictions in which the income taxes paid that meet a quantitative threshold; (5) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense\n(or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign; and (6) income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal,\nstate, and foreign. The ASU eliminates the requirement to disclose the nature and estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in the\nunrecognized tax benefits balance in the next 12 months and to disclose the cumulative amount of each type of temporary difference when a deferred tax\nliability is not recognized because of the exceptions to comprehensive recognition of deferred taxes related to subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures.\nFor public business entities, the amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual\nfinancial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis, but\nretrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard and does not anticipate it will have a significant\nimpact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\n(16) Subsequent Events\nSubsequent events have been evaluated for potential recognition and disclosure through the date the Company’s financial statements were filed with the\nSEC. On October 23, 2024, the Company declared a quarterly dividend to common shareholders of $0.47 per share, to be paid on November 14, 2024 to\nshareholders of record as of November 4, 2024.\nNo other undisclosed events requiring recognition or disclosure were identified.\n43\nTable of Contents\nItem 2.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWhen we refer to “we,” “our,” “us,” “First Interstate,” or the “Company” in this report, we mean First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. and our consolidated\nsubsidiaries, including our wholly owned subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, unless the context indicates that we refer only to the parent company, First Interstate\nBancSystem, Inc. When we refer to the “Bank” or “FIB” in this report, we mean only First Interstate Bank.\nThe following discussion of our consolidated financial data reflects our historical results of operations and financial condition and should be read in\nconjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on\nForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the audited financial statements and related notes contained therein, as previously filed with the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that Could Affect Future Results\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and\nRule 175 promulgated thereunder, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and Rule 3b-6 promulgated\nthereunder, that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Any statements about our plans, objectives, expectations, strategies, beliefs, or future performance or\nevents constitute forward-looking statements. Such statements are identified by words or phrases such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “trends,”\n“objectives,” “views,” “continues” or similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” “should,” “could,” “might,” “may,” or similar\nexpressions. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, estimates and other important factors that could cause\nactual results to differ materially from any results, performance or events expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of\nrisks that may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations in the forward-looking statements is included below in this report under the\ncaption “Risk Factors” and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the captions “Cautionary Note Regarding\nForward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors”. These factors and the other risk factors described in our periodic and current reports filed with the SEC from\ntime to time, however, are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from\nthose expressed in or implied by any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results.\nAll forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set\nforth above. Interested parties are urged to read in their entirety the referenced risk factors prior to making any investment decision with respect to the Company.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake or assume any obligation to update publicly any of these\nstatements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements,\nexcept to the extent required by applicable law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional\nupdates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States, this document\ncontains non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it would be helpful to understand our results of operations or financial position. The\nCompany’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide additional intelligence about ongoing operations and enhance comparability of\nresults of operations with prior periods by presenting financial results without the impact of items or events that may obscure trends in the Company’s\nunderlying performance. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the\nrelated financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as\nwell as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.\n44\nTable of Contents\nFully-Taxable Equivalent Basis. The Company adjusts its net interest income to include its interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) basis and\nfurther adjusts to exclude purchase accounting interest accretion on acquired loans. Interest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-\nGAAP financial measures. Net interest margin (FTE) is calculated as annualized net interest income on an FTE basis divided by average earning assets.\nManagement believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also\nallows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate\nof 21 percent. These measures are considered standard measures of comparison within the banking industry. We encourage readers to consider the Unaudited\nConsolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-Q in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures included herein for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nLimitations associated with non-GAAP financial measures include the risks that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items included in these\nmeasures and that other companies might calculate these measures differently. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be considered an alternative to the\nCompany’s GAAP results.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a financial and bank holding company focused on community banking. Since our incorporation in Montana in 1971, we have grown both organically\nand through strategic acquisitions. We operate 299 banking offices, including branches and detached drive-up facilities, in communities across fourteen states—\nArizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Through\nour bank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services—including online and mobile banking—to\nindividuals, businesses, government entities, and others throughout our market areas. We are proud to provide lending opportunities to clients that participate in\na wide variety of industries, including:\n• Agriculture • Healthcare • Professional services • Technology\n• Construction • Hospitality • Real Estate Development • Tourism\n• Education • Housing • Retail • Wholesale trade\n• Governmental services\nOur principal business activity is lending to, accepting deposits from, and conducting financial transactions with or for individuals, businesses, governmental\nunits, and other entities located in the communities we serve. We derive our income principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from\ninterest and dividends earned on fixed income investments.\nWe also derive income from non-interest sources such as: (i) fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; (ii) wealth management\nservices, such as trust, employee benefit, investment, and insurance services; (iii) mortgage loan originations, sales, and servicing; (iv) merchant and electronic\nbanking services; and (v) from time-to-time, gains on sales of assets and securities.\nOur principal expenses include: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and employee benefits; (iii) data processing and\ncommunication costs primarily associated with maintaining loan and deposit functions; (iv) furniture, equipment, and occupancy expenses for maintaining our\nfacilities; (v) professional fees, including FDIC insurance assessments; (vi) income tax expense; (vii) provisions for credit losses; (viii) intangible amortization;\n(ix) other real estate owned expenses; and (x) other ancillary expenses including legal expenses, credit card rewards expense, fees associated with originating\nand closing loans, insurance, and other expenses necessary to support our employees and service our clients. From time to time, we also incur acquisition costs\nrelated to our strategic acquisitions.\nRecent Trends and Developments\nOur community banking footprint spans across the Rocky Mountain, Pacific Northwest, Midwest, and Southwest regions, in large part due to our acquisition\nactivity. As part of our normal course of business, we continue to evaluate bank acquisitions and other strategic opportunities on an on-going basis.\nThe Company has ample liquidity, and the capital ratios exceed all regulatory requirements to be deemed “well-capitalized” as of September 30, 2024. Our\ndeposit base is diversified, including by depositor, which includes individuals, businesses across multiple industries, governmental units, and other entities, as\nwell as geographically, across the communities we serve.\n45\nTable of Contents\nAs of September 30, 2024, our FDIC insured deposits consisted of 65.0% of total deposits, including accounts eligible for pass-through insurance. As of\nOctober 28, 2024, the Bank had available borrowing capacity of $4.7 billion with the FHLB and $0.9 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) based on\npledged investment securities and loan collateral.\nU.S. inflation data hit a multi-decade high in June 2022, climbing to 9.1%, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, we have now seen a\nmeaningful decrease to 2.4% as of September 2024. While our operating expenses are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of the\nCompany largely consists of monetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, investments, loans, deposits and other borrowings, are assets and liabilities which\nare or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the\nCompany’s performance than does general inflation. However, despite the more recent declines, inflationary pressures from the last two years may still have\nnegative impacts on the Company’s clients and their customers, impacting their ability or willingness to repay loans or maintain deposits.\nThe Federal Reserve stated its current objective is to return the rate of inflation to 2.0% and it is closely monitoring the progress that has been made to\nachieve this goal. The Federal Reserve increased short-term interest rates 525 basis points between March 16, 2022 and July 29, 2023. With general inflationary\npressures easing, since July 2023, the Federal Reserve had paused any further changes to short-term interest rates only to decrease them by 50 basis points in\nSeptember 2024. While many financial industry experts have speculated that rates will decline further in the near-term, the Federal Reserve has not yet provided\ndefinitive guidance on any further changes to short-term interest rates.\nThe Company’s quarterly yield on interest earning assets increased to 4.83% as of September 30, 2024 from 4.80% as of June 30, 2024, and 4.63% as of\nSeptember 30, 2023.\nThe sustained elevation of short-term interest rates have also impacted the Company’s cost of funds, primarily resulting from the shift of non-interest-bearing\ndeposits into higher-cost, interest-bearing, and time deposit balances as well as variable rate debt. The Company’s cost of funds was stable at 1.86% during the\nthree months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and increased from 1.59% during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the third\nquarter of 2024, the change in the mix and yield on earning assets offset the changes in the mix and cost of funds, resulting in an increase of the Company’s net\ninterest margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 to 3.01% from 2.97% during the three months ended June 30, 2024. The change in mix and\ncost of funds more than offset the change in the mix and yield on earning assets as the net interest margin declined from 3.05% for the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023. The Company’s FTE net interest margin increased to 3.04% during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 3.00% during the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024, and decreased from 3.07% during the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nA slowdown, downturn, or recession in the U.S. economy could impact the Company by impacting the level of deposits held by our clients, whether through\na higher volume of withdrawals or through a lower volume of deposits. Client deposits are one of the Company’s primary lending sources. The credit quality of\nthe Company’s loans may also be impacted if clients must weather adverse economic conditions which could result in an increase in credit losses or other\nrelated expenses.\nPrimary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business\nAs a banking institution, we monitor and evaluate our financial condition and our results of operations by examining the levels and trends of the line items\nincluded in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as the various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry and monitored by our\nregulators. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels as well as the financial condition and performance of comparable\nbanking institutions in our region and nationally.\nAs discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, our financial performance is impacted by a number of external\nfactors outside our control, as well as our ability to execute on the key components of our strategy for continued success and future growth. See Part II – Other\nInformation, “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for an update of the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these\nprinciples requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and\naccompanying notes. The most significant accounting policies we follow are summarized in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included\nin our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and are also referenced in Note 1 to the unaudited financial statements in this\nquarterly report. There have been no material changes during the third quarter of 2024 in our critical accounting estimates and policies from the critical\naccounting estimates and policies as described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to measure the Company’s financial position and operating results\nprimarily in terms of historic dollars. Changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered. We manage our interest\nrate risk in several ways. Refer to “Note – Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in the accompanying “Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements”\nfor further discussion on how we manage interest rate risk. There can be no assurance that we will not be materially adversely affected by future changes in\ninterest rates, as interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide detail about the results of our operations and financial condition. More information regarding\nthe results as of December 31, 2023 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nNet Income\nNet income decreased $17.2 million to $55.5 million, or $0.54 per share, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of\n$72.7 million, or $0.70 per share, for the same period in 2023, and is primarily attributable to a higher provision for credit losses and lower net interest income.\nLower net interest income resulted from higher interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities during the 2024 period. This decrease in net interest income was\npartially offset by higher non-interest income, lower tax expense, and lower non-interest expenses.\nNet income decreased $22.1 million to $173.9 million, or $1.69 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net income of\n$196.0 million, or $1.89 per share for the same period in 2023. The decrease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same\nperiod in 2023 was primarily attributable to lower net interest income, which has resulted from higher interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and higher\nprovision expense. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in non-interest income resulting from a $23.4 million loss on the disposition of available-\nfor-sale investment securities during the 2023 period as well as from lower non-interest expenses during the 2024 period.\nNet Interest Income\nOur operating results depend primarily on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest the Company earns on its interest-earning\nassets, such as loans and investment securities, and the expense the Company pays on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Net interest\nincome depends on both the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rates the Company earns or pays on them.\nChanges in interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities, has the most significant impact on\nnet interest income. Other factors like volume of loans, investment securities, and other interest-earning assets compared to the volume of interest-bearing\ndeposits and indebtedness also cause changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and\nstockholders’ equity, help to support earning assets.\n47\nTable of Contents\nFor the periods indicated, the following table presents average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest-\nearning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities.\nAverage Balance Sheets, Yields and Rates Three Months Ended\n(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nAverage Average Average Average\nInterest Interest\nBalance (2) (5) Rate Balance (2) (5) Rate\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans (1) $ 18,209.1 $ 260.3 5.69 % $ 18,317.4 $ 251.5 5.45 %\nInvestment securities:\nTaxable 8,209.7 60.7 2.94 8,877.6 66.0 2.95\nTax-exempt 185.3 0.9 1.93 190.4 0.9 1.88\nInvestment in FHLB and FRB stock 176.0 2.8 6.33 202.6 2.9 5.68\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks 353.1 4.9 5.52 208.5 3.0 5.71\nFederal funds sold 0.1 — — 0.3 — —\nTotal interest-earning assets $ 27,133.3 $ 329.6 4.83 % $ 27,796.8 $ 324.3 4.63 %\nNon-interest-earning assets 2,813.6 2,955.5\nTotal assets $ 29,946.9 $ 30,752.3\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits $ 6,143.9 $ 15.1 0.98 % $ 6,361.5 $ 13.3 0.83 %\nSavings deposits 7,763.4 42.2 2.16 7,838.4 33.6 1.70\nTime deposits 2,863.1 26.9 3.74 2,938.0 21.9 2.96\nRepurchase agreements 643.9 1.4 0.86 895.2 1.7 0.75\nOther borrowed funds 2,526.6 32.0 5.04 2,396.3 33.6 5.56\nLong-term debt 147.2 1.6 4.32 120.8 1.5 4.93\nSubordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts 163.1 3.3 8.05 163.1 3.3 8.03\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities $ 20,251.2 $ 122.5 2.41 % $ 20,713.3 $ 108.9 2.09 %\nNon-interest-bearing deposits 5,927.2 6,401.2\nOther non-interest-bearing liabilities 461.4 504.0\nStockholders’ equity 3,307.1 3,133.8\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 29,946.9 $ 30,752.3\nNet FTE interest income (non-GAAP)(3) $ 207.1 $ 215.4\nLess FTE adjustments(2) (1.6) (1.7)\nNet interest income from consolidated statements of income $ 205.5 $ 213.7\nInterest rate spread 2.42 % 2.54 %\nNet interest margin 3.01 3.05\nNet FTE interest margin (non-GAAP)(3) 3.04 3.07\nCost of funds, including non-interest-bearing demand deposits (4) 1.86 1.59\n(1) Average loan balances include loans held for sale and loans held for investment, net of deferred fees and costs, which include non-accrual loans.

The provision incorporated the impact of credit movement during the quarter, changes in loan balances,\nthe attributes of the current portfolio, asset quality metrics, a review of the current economic outlook, and net charge-offs of $27.4 million, or an annualized\n0.60% of average loans outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net charge-offs of $1.1 million, or an annualized 0.02%\nof average loans outstanding during the same period in 2023. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were composed of charge-offs of $29.1 million,\nprimarily consisting of a $15.9 million commercial real estate loan and a $6.2 million construction real estate loan. These charge-offs were offset by recoveries\nof $1.7 million.\nThe provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of $34.1 million included a provision for credit losses on loans held for investment of $47.0\nmillion, a reduction of credit losses on unfunded commitments of $12.8 million, and a reduction of credit losses on investment securities of $0.1 million. This\ncompares to a provision for credit losses of $26.8 million during the same period in 2023. The allowance for credit losses is updated quarterly based on the\nattributes of the current loan and investment securities portfolios, asset quality metrics, and a review of the current economic outlook.\nFor information regarding our non-performing loans, see “Financial Condition – Non-Performing Assets” included herein.

The increase for the three months ended September 30,\n2024 reflects a $2.6 million gain on the sale of a branch. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the realized loss\nof $23.4 million on the disposition of available-for-sale investment securities and a $1.9 million loss related to the fair value of loans held for sale recognized\nthrough other income during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and a gain on the sale of a branch during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nNon-Interest Expense\nNon-interest expense decreased $1.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by lower other\nexpenses and professional fees, which were partially offset by higher salaries and wages, that included $3.8 million in CEO transition related expenses. Non-\ninterest expense decreased $14.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The decreases were driven\nby lower employee benefits, software costs, and other expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increases in salaries and wages that included\n$3.8 million in CEO transition expenses, expenses related to OREO, and FDIC insurance premiums, driven by $1.5 million in FDIC special assessment accruals\nin the first quarter of 2024.\nThe following table presents the composition of our non-interest expense as of the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nNon-Interest Expense September 30, September 30,\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 $ Change % Change 2024 2023 $ Change % Change\nSalaries and wages $ 70.9 $ 65.4 $ 5.5 8.4 % $ 202.4 $ 199.1 $ 3.3 1.7 %\nEmployee benefits 19.7 19.7 — — 55.9 61.8 (5.9) (9.5)\nOutsourced technology services 14.6 14.5 0.1 0.7 42.2 44.5 (2.3) (5.2)\nOccupancy, net 11.8 11.7 0.1 0.9 35.8 35.9 (0.1) (0.3)\nFurniture and equipment 5.2 5.3 (0.1) (1.9) 15.4 16.8 (1.4) (8.3)\nOREO expense, net of income — 0.5 (0.5) (100.0) 4.0 1.3 2.7 207.7\nProfessional fees 4.2 5.1 (0.9) (17.6) 16.1 14.9 1.2 8.1\nFDIC insurance premiums 5.2 5.0 0.2 4.0 19.2 15.4 3.8 24.7\nOther intangibles amortization 3.6 3.9 (0.3) (7.7) 11.0 11.8 (0.8) (6.8)\nOther expenses 24.2 30.0 (5.8) (19.3) 74.5 89.3 (14.8) (16.6)\nTotal non-interest expense $ 159.4 $ 161.1 $ (1.7) (1.1) $ 476.5 $ 490.8 $ (14.3) (2.9)\n52\nTable of Contents\nSalaries and wages expense increased $5.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased $3.3 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases during the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 are\nprimarily due to the accrual of $3.8 million for transition expenses related to the CEO’s pending retirement, lower deferred loan costs, and higher short-term\nincentive accruals over the prior year, which were offset by lower salaries and wages and net severance costs as a result of staffing reductions.\nEmployee benefits expense was stable during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased $5.9 million during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower health insurance costs and lower payroll taxes, partially\noffset by higher long-term incentive accruals.\nOutsourced technology services expense increased $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023\nand decreased $2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to\nlower software maintenance costs.\nFDIC insurance premiums increased $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased $3.8 million during the nine months\nended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily resulting from a $1.5 million special assessment accrual recorded during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2024.\nOther expenses primarily include advertising and public relations costs; office supply, postage, freight, telephone, and travel expenses; donations expense;\ndebit and credit card expenses; board of director fees; legal expenses; and other losses. Other expenses decreased $5.8 million during the three months ended\nSeptember 30, 2024 and decreased $14.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily resulting\nfrom decreases in donation expense, credit card reward accruals, reclassifications of new market tax credit amortization expenses, which moved to income tax\nexpenses, as a result of the adoption of ASU 2023-02, fraud losses, travel costs, and continued focus on our cost saving initiatives.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate was 23.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and\n23.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.4% for the same period in 2023. Differences between the Company's effective tax rate and\napplicable federal and state blended statutory rate of approximately 24.9% are due to the proportion of non-taxable revenues, non-deductible expenses, and net\nbenefits from tax credits as compared to the levels of pre-tax earnings. Additionally, in connection with the Company’s adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1,\n2024, the Company began recording proportional amortization of New Market Tax Credits as a component of income tax expense instead of other expenses.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets decreased $1,075.7 million, or 3.5%, to $29,595.5 million as of September 30, 2024, from $30,671.2 million as of December 31, 2023, primarily\ndue to decreases in investment securities and loans held for investment which supported declines in deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements,\nwhich was partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. Significant fluctuations in balance sheet accounts are discussed below. More information\nregarding the results as of December 31, 2023 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInvestment Securities\nWe manage our investment portfolio primarily as a source of liquidity. In doing so, we seek to obtain the highest risk adjusted return within our risk tolerance\nand liquidity guidelines, while satisfying the pledging requirements for deposits of state and political subdivisions and securities sold under repurchase\nagreements. Our portfolio is primarily comprised of U.S. Treasury notes, state, county, and municipal, U.S. government agency, U.S. government agency\nresidential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized loan obligations, private mortgage-backed, and\ncorporate securities. Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in the Bank are additional investments that are classified as cash equivalents rather than as\ninvestment securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value, while investment securities classified as held-to-maturity\nare recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized gains or losses, net of the deferred tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are reported as increases or decreases in\naccumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of stockholders’ equity.\n53\nTable of Contents\nInvestment securities decreased $773.8 million, or 8.6%, to $8,275.6 million, or 28.0% of total assets, as of September 30, 2024, from $9,049.4 million, or\n29.5% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily resulting from normal pay-downs and maturities, partially offset by $134.6 million\nincrease in fair market values and $102.2 million of reinvestment into investment securities.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated duration of our investment portfolio was 3.4 and 3.5 years, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had $6,662.4 million and $8,284.5 million, respectively, of investment securities that had been in a\ncontinuous loss position for more than twelve months. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had no allowance for credit losses on\navailable-for-sale securities and an allowance for credit losses on held-to maturity securities classified as corporate and municipal securities of $0.7 million and\n$0.8 million, respectively.\nLoans Held for Investment, Net of Deferred Fees and Costs\nLoans held for investment, net of deferred fees and costs, decreased $252.5 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023.\nThe following table presents the composition and comparison of loans held for investment for the periods indicated:\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 $ Change % Change\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 9,219.3 $ 8,869.2 $ 350.1 3.9 %\nConstruction 1,307.9 1,826.5 (518.6) (28.4)\nResidential 2,217.8 2,244.3 (26.5) (1.2)\nAgricultural 726.4 716.8 9.6 1.3\nTotal real estate 13,471.4 13,656.8 (185.4) (1.4)\nConsumer:\nIndirect 742.2 740.9 1.3 0.2\nDirect and advance lines 136.9 141.6 (4.7) (3.3)\nCredit card 76.4 76.5 (0.1) (0.1)\nTotal consumer 955.5 959.0 (3.5) (0.4)\nCommercial 2,919.7 2,906.8 12.9 0.4\nAgricultural 689.8 769.4 (79.6) (10.3)\nOther, including overdrafts 2.5 0.1 2.4 NM\nDeferred loan fees and costs (11.8) (12.5) 0.7 (5.6)\nLoans held for investment, net of deferred loan fees and costs $ 18,027.1 $ 18,279.6 $ (252.5) (1.4)\nDeclines in the construction real estate loans are primarily a result of the conversion of loans to permanent commercial real estate financing.\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-performing loans and OREO.\nNon-Performing Loans. Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest.\nNon-accrual loans. We generally place loans on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due unless they are well secured and in the process of\ncollection or if the collection of principal and interest is in doubt. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected\nis reversed from income. Non-accrual loans increased approximately $66.3 million, or 62.3%, to $172.7 million as of September 30, 2024, from $106.4 million\nas of December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the categorization of a single $54.4 million commercial and industrial loan relationship to non-accrual in the first\nquarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024 there were approximately $60.7 million of non-accrual loans for which there was no related allowance for credit\nlosses, as these loans had sufficient collateral securing the loan for repayment.\n54\nTable of Contents\nLoans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest. Loans past due 90 days or more accruing interest were $1.8 million as of\nSeptember 30, 2024, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 63.3%, from $4.9 million as of December 31, 2023.\nOther Real Estate Owned (“OREO”). OREO consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral underlying defaulted loans. We record\nOREO at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate at the time it is acquired, is recorded as a\ncharge against the allowance for credit losses. Estimated losses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to earnings in the\nperiod in which they are identified. OREO decreased $12.1 million, or 73.3%, to $4.4 million as of September 30, 2024, from $16.5 million as of December 31,\n2023, primarily resulting from the disposal of a $9.0 million agricultural real estate property and a $3.0 million commercial property.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding non-performing assets as of the dates indicated:\nNon-Performing Assets\n(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2023\nNon-performing loans:\nNon-accrual loans $ 172.7 $ 165.6 $ 81.4\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more 1.8 2.6 3.2\nTotal non-performing loans 174.5 168.2 84.6\nOREO 4.4 6.7 11.6\nTotal non-performing assets $ 178.9 $ 174.9 $ 96.2\nNon-accrual loans to loans held for investment 0.96 % 0.91 % 0.45 %\nNon-performing loans to loans held for investment 0.97 0.92 0.46\nNon-performing assets to loans held for investment and OREO 0.99 0.96 0.53\nNon-performing assets to total assets 0.60 0.58 0.31\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of our non-performing loans among our various loan categories as of the dates indicated.\nNon-Performing Loans by Loan Type\nSeptember 30, Percent Percent\n(Dollars in millions) 2024 of Total December 31, 2023 of Total\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 45.2 25.9 % $ 28.2 25.3 %\nConstruction 0.1 0.1 17.2 15.5\nResidential 14.5 8.3 11.3 10.2\nAgricultural 4.7 2.7 5.4 4.8\nTotal real estate 64.5 37.0 62.1 55.8\nConsumer 4.6 2.6 4.0 3.6\nCommercial 82.2 47.1 11.8 10.6\nAgricultural 23.2 13.3 33.4 30.0\nTotal non-performing loans $ 174.5 100.0 % $ 111.3 100.0 %\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company performs a quarterly assessment of the appropriateness of its allowance for credit losses in accordance with GAAP. The allowance for credit\nlosses is established through a provision for credit losses based on our evaluation of quantitative and qualitative risk factors in our loan portfolio at each balance\nsheet date. In determining the allowance for credit losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the expected loss can be identified and\nreasonably determined over the life of the loans. The balance of the allowance for credit losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans,\nhistorical loan loss rates, changes in the nature or tenure of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current\nenvironmental and economic factors, and the estimated impact of forecasted economic conditions on historical loan loss rates.\n55\nTable of Contents\nThe allowance for credit losses is increased by provisions charged against earnings and net recoveries of charged-off loans and is reduced by negative\nprovisions credited to earnings and net loan charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses consists of three elements:\n(1) Specific valuation allowances associated with collateral-dependent and other individually evaluated loans. Specific valuation allowances are\ndetermined based on assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans as determined through independent appraisals, the present value\nof future cash flows, observable market prices, and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting loans.\n(2) Collective valuation allowances based on loan loss experience and future expectations for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends. The\nCompany applies open pool methodologies for all portfolio segments. The open pool methodology averages quarterly loss rates by modeling segment,\ncalculated as quarter-to-date net charge off balance divided by the end of period balance. Loss rates are recalculated quarterly with recoveries captured\nin the quarter a loan was charged off, are averaged across a look back period from 2009 to the current period, and are annualized. Macroeconomic-\nconditioned historical loss rates are applied to loan-level cash flows. Expected future principal and interest cash flows are calculated using contractual\nrepayment terms and prepayment, utilization, interest rate, and probability of default assumptions. Macroeconomic sensitivity models calculate\nsegment-specific multipliers using third party forecast data. The multipliers condition the annual loss rates over the 2-year forecast period, followed by\na 1-year straight-line reversion to the unadjusted historical average loss rates. The unadjusted loss rates then apply for the remaining life of the loan.\nEstimated losses are totaled and aggregated to the segment level.\n(3) Qualitative allowance adjustments are determined based on asset quality trends, industry concentrations, environmental risks, changes in portfolio\ncomposition, and other qualitative risk factors, both internal and external to the Company. Other qualitative factors, including changes in loan and\nlending policies, collateral quality, underwriting standards and personnel, credit review quality, and model imprecision, are also considered.\nBased on the assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, the Company records provisions for credit losses to maintain the allowance\nfor credit losses at appropriate levels.\nLoans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value as adjusted for credit risk and an allowance for credit losses at the date of\nacquisition. For loans with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination, the difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal\nbalance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized into interest income using the effective interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity.\nAn allowance for credit loss is recorded for the expected credit losses over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are\nrecorded through provision expense using the same methodology as other loans held for investment.\nFor loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, the Company determines the fair value of the\nloans by estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at\nan appropriate market rate of interest. An allowance for credit losses is recognized by estimating the expected credit losses of the purchased asset and recording\nan adjustment to the acquisition date fair value to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the asset. Differences between the established amortized cost basis,\nand the unpaid principal balance of the asset, is considered to be a non-credit discount/premium and is accreted/amortized into interest income using the level\nyield interest method. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense using the same methodology as other loans\nheld for investment.\nLoans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when management believes the collectability of the principal is unlikely, or,\nwith respect to consumer installment loans, according to an established delinquency schedule. Generally, loans are charged-off when (1) there has been no\nmaterial principal reduction within the previous 90 days and there is no pending sale of collateral or other assets, (2) there is no significant or pending event\nwhich will result in principal reduction within the upcoming 90 days, (3) it is clear that we will not be able to collect all or a portion of the loan, (4) payments on\nthe loan are sporadic, will result in an excessive amortization, or are not consistent with the collateral held, or (5) foreclosure or repossession actions are\npending. Loan charge-offs do not directly correspond with the receipt of independent appraisals or the use of observable market data if the collateral value is\ndetermined to be sufficient to repay the principal balance of the loan.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIf a collateral-dependent loan is adequately collateralized, a specific valuation allowance for credit losses is not recorded. As such, significant changes in\ncollateral-dependent and non-performing loans do not necessarily correspond proportionally with changes in the specific valuation component of the allowance\nfor credit losses. Additionally, the Company expects the timing of charge-offs will vary between quarters and will not necessarily correspond proportionally to\nchanges in the allowance for credit losses or changes in non-performing or collateral-dependent loans due to timing differences among the initial identification\nof a collateral-dependent loan, recording of a specific valuation allowance for collateral-dependent loans, and any resulting charge-off of uncollectible principal.\nOur allowance for credit losses was $225.4 million, or 1.25% of loans held for investment as of September 30, 2024 compared to $227.7 million, or 1.25% of\nloans held for investment, as of December 31, 2023. The Company’s allowance for off-balance sheet credit losses was $5.6 million as of September 30, 2024,\ncompared to $18.4 million as of December 31, 2023, due to a decline in off-balance sheet commitments.\nAlthough we have established our allowance for credit losses in accordance with GAAP in the United States and we believe that the allowance for credit\nlosses is appropriate to provide for known and expected losses in the portfolio, future provisions will be subject to on-going evaluations of the risks in the loan\nportfolio. If the economy declines or asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our allowance for credit losses as of and for the periods indicated:\nAllowance for Credit Losses Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended\n(Dollars in millions) Sep 30, Dec 31, Sep 30, Sep 30, Sep 30,\n2024 2023 2023 2024 2023\nBeginning balance $ 232.8 $ 226.7 $ 224.6 $ 227.7 $ 220.1\nProvision for credit losses 20.0 5.8 3.2 47.0 25.3\nCharge offs:\nReal estate\nCommercial 15.9 1.3 1.7 21.6 6.3\nConstruction 6.2 0.6 — 13.2 9.7\nResidential 0.1 — 0.1 0.7 0.6\nConsumer 4.1 3.6 3.7 11.9 10.4\nCommercial 2.5 1.2 0.7 8.7 2.2\nAgricultural 0.3 — — 0.3 —\nTotal charge-offs 29.1 6.7 6.2 56.4 29.2\nRecoveries:\nReal estate\nCommercial 0.1 0.1 3.4 0.8 4.1\nConstruction 0.1 0.1 — 0.1 —\nResidential — — 0.1 0.1 0.1\nAgricultural — — — 0.1 0.3\nConsumer 1.3 1.0 1.1 3.6 3.7\nCommercial 0.2 0.7 0.5 2.1 1.9\nAgricultural — — — 0.3 0.4\nTotal recoveries 1.7 1.9 5.1 7.1 10.5\nNet charge-offs 27.4 4.8 1.1 49.3 18.7\nEnding balance $ 225.4 $ 227.7 $ 226.7 $ 225.4 $ 226.7\nAllowance for off-balance sheet credit losses:\nBeginning balance $ 5.8 $ 18.8 $ 20.8 $ 18.4 $ 16.2\n(Reduction of) provision for credit losses (0.2) (0.4) (2.0) (12.8) 2.6\nEnding balance $ 5.6 $ 18.4 $ 18.8 $ 5.6 $ 18.8\nAllowance for credit losses on investment securities:\nBeginning balance $ 0.7 $ 0.8 $ 2.1 $ 0.8 $ 1.9\nReduction of provision for investment securities — — (1.3) (0.1) (1.1)\nEnding balance $ 0.7 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 0.7 $ 0.8\nTotal allowance for credit losses $ 231.7 $ 246.9 $ 246.3 $ 231.7 $ 246.3\nTotal provision for (reduction of) credit losses 19.8 5.4 (0.1) 34.1 26.8\nLoans held for investment, net of deferred fees and costs 18,027.1 18,279.6 18,213.3 18,027.1 18,213.3\nAverage loans 18,209.1 18,255.9 18,317.4 18,250.5 18,314.3\nNet loans charged-off to average loans, annualized 0.60 % 0.10 % 0.02 % 0.36 % 0.14 %\nAllowance to non-accrual loans 130.52 214.00 278.50 130.52 278.50\nAllowance to loans held for investment 1.25 1.25 1.24 1.25 1.24\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal liabilities decreased $1,214.0 million, or 4.4%, to $26,229.7 million as of September 30, 2024, from $27,443.7 million as of December 31, 2023,\nprimarily due to decreases in deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and other borrowed funds.

The Bank pays deposit insurance premiums based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The estimated amount of deposits in excess of the\nFDIC insurance limit at September 30, 2024 was $8.0 billion, or 35.0% of total deposits. Estimates of uninsured deposits are based on the methodologies and\nassumptions used in the Bank’s call reports and do not necessarily reflect an evaluation of all scenarios that potentially would determine the availability of\ndeposit insurance to customer accounts based on FDIC regulations.\nSecurities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements\nIn addition to deposits, repurchase agreements with commercial depositors, which include municipalities, provide an additional source of funds. Under\nrepurchase agreements, deposit balances are invested in short-term U.S. government agency securities overnight and are then repurchased the following day. All\noutstanding repurchase agreements are due in one day and balances fluctuate in the normal course of our client’s business. Securities sold under repurchase\nagreement balances decreased $225.5 million, or 28.8%, to $557.2 million as of September 30, 2024, from $782.7 million as of December 31, 2023.\nOther Borrowed Funds\nOther borrowed funds is comprised of FHLB and BTFP overnight and fixed-rate borrowings with remaining contractual tenors of up to one year. Other\nborrowed funds decreased $523.0 million, or 20.1%, to $2,080.0 million as of September 30, 2024 from $2,603.0 million as of December 31, 2023.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity Management\nCapital Resources. Stockholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock, and changes in the\nunrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities. Stockholders’ equity increased $138.3 million, or 4.3%, to $3,365.8\nmillion as of September 30, 2024, from $3,227.5 million as of December 31, 2023, due to a decrease to the unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities\nthrough other comprehensive income and the retention of retained earnings, partially offset by cash dividends paid and stock repurchases of vested restricted\nshares tendered in lieu of cash for payment of income tax withholding amounts by participants.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOn October 23, 2024, the Company’s board of directors declared a dividend of $0.47 per common share, payable on November 14, 2024, to common\nstockholders of record as of November 4, 2024. The dividend equates to a 6.3% annual yield based on the $29.85 average closing pricing of the Company’s\ncommon stock during the third quarter of 2024.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company must comply with the capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve, and our subsidiary Bank must\ncomply with the capital requirements established by the FDIC. The current risk-based guidelines applicable to us and our Bank are based on the Basel III\nframework, as implemented by the federal bank regulators. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had capital levels that, in all cases,\nexceeded the guidelines to be deemed “well-capitalized.” For additional information regarding our capital levels, see “Note – Regulatory Capital” in the\naccompanying “Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report.\nLiquidity. Liquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity\nposition to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return-on-investment\nobjectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds.\nLiquid assets include cash, interest-bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold, available-for-sale investment securities, and maturing or prepaying balances in\nour held-to-maturity investment and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase\nagreements, and borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market funds through non-core\ndeposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB and BTFP advances, the issuance of debt securities, additional borrowings through\nthe Federal Reserve’s discount window, and the issuance of preferred or common securities. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily\nto fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures, and shareholder\ndividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and\ninvestment portfolios, the issuance of securities, borrowings and other debt financing, and increases in client deposits.\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $259.8 million, net cash provided by investing activities was\n$1,200.0 million and net cash used in financing activities was $1,339.2 million. Major uses of cash were $459.0 million in outflows of deposits and $773.0\nmillion in repayment of other borrowed funds. Major sources of cash included $266.5 million of advances in long-term debt and $1,009.4 million in investment\nsecurity maturities and paydowns. Total cash and cash equivalents were $698.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $578.0 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023. For additional information regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows, see the unaudited “Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows,” included in Part I – Financial Information, “Item 1 – Financial Statements.” For additional information regarding our deposits, see “Financial\nCondition – Deposits,” included in Part I – Financial Information, “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations.”\nAs a holding company, we are a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary Bank and, therefore, we provide for our own liquidity. Our primary\nsources of funding include management fees and dividends declared and paid by the Bank and access to capital markets. There are statutory, regulatory, and debt\ncovenant limitations that affect the ability of our Bank to pay dividends to us. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our\nongoing short-term cash obligations.\nThe Company continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed\nappropriate. We are not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In\naddition, we are not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us. The Bank\nsatisfies incremental liquidity needs with either liquid assets or external funding sources. Available liquidity includes cash, FHLB advances and FRB borrowings\nthrough the discount window. The Bank has pledged its investment securities portfolio to access wholesale funding as needed and does not intend to sell or\nrestructure securities at this time.\n60\nTable of Contents\nSeptember 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(Dollars in billions) FHLB FRB BTFP Total FHLB FRB BTFP Total\nTotal borrowing capacity $ 6.0 $ 0.9 $ 1.0 $ 7.9 $ 6.2 $ 0.7 $ 2.4 $ 9.3\nBorrowings outstanding 1.1 — 1.0 2.1 2.6 — — 2.6\nRemaining Capacity, at period end $ 4.9 $ 0.9 $ — $ 5.8 $ 3.6 $ 0.7 $ 2.4 $ 6.7\nCash and due from banks 0.4 0.4\nInterest-bearing deposits 0.3 0.2\nTotal available liquidity $ 6.5 $ 7.3\nThrough the Bank’s relationship with the FHLB, the Bank owns $59.3 million of FHLB stock and has access to additional liquidity and funding sources\nthrough FHLB advances. The Bank’s borrowing capacity is dependent upon the amount of collateral the Bank places at the FHLB. As of September 30, 2024,\nthe Bank had FHLB borrowings of $1,080.0 million with remaining tenors of one-year or less and $3.9 million with original tenors of greater than one-year. The\nBank’s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $4,885.2 million as of September 30, 2024.\nThe Bank had a $1.0 billion advance through the BTFP as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank’s borrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Discount Window was $0.9 billion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note – Recent Authoritative Accounting Guidance” in the accompanying “Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this\nreport for details of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on our financial statements.\nItem 3.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES\nABOUT MARKET RISK\nThis analysis should be read in conjunction with text under the caption “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in our Form 10-K,\nwhich text is incorporated herein by reference. Our analysis of market risk and market-sensitive financial information contains forward-looking statements and\nis subject to the disclosure at the beginning of “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding\nsuch forward-looking information.\nAsset Liability Management\nThe goal of asset liability management is the prudent control of market risk, liquidity, and capital. Asset liability management is governed by policies, goals,\nand objectives adopted and reviewed by the Bank’s board of directors. Development of asset liability management strategies and monitoring of interest rate risk\nare the responsibility of the Asset Liability Committee, or ALCO, which is composed of members of senior management.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or long-term value due to changes in interest rates. Our primary source of earnings is net interest\nincome, which is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed of changes in interest rates, the relationship between rates on interest-\nbearing assets and liabilities, the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments, and the mix of interest-bearing assets and liabilities.\nThe ability to optimize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of an interest rate spread that can be managed during periods of\nfluctuating interest rates. Interest sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest income will be affected by market interest rates over a period.\n61\nTable of Contents\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity\nWe believe net interest income sensitivity provides the best perspective of how day-to-day decisions affect our interest rate risk profile. We monitor net\ninterest income sensitivity by utilizing an income simulation model to subject 12- and 24- month net interest income to various rate movements. Simulations\nmodeled quarterly include scenarios where market rates change instantaneously up or down in a parallel or non-parallel manner. Estimates produced by our\nincome simulation model are based on numerous assumptions including, but not limited to: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in\nthe yield curve, (3) repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying\nrate indices, (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios, (6) the effect of interest rate limitations in our assets, such as caps and\nfloors, and (7) overall growth and repayment rates and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure\ninterest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results, but rather to provide\ninsight into our current interest rate exposure and execute appropriate asset/liability management strategies accordingly.\nThe following table presents the net interest income simulation model’s projected change in net interest income over a one-year horizon due to a change in\ninterest rates. The net interest income simulation assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve and a static balance sheet. The net interest income simulation also\nuses a “deposit beta” modeling assumption which is an estimate of the change in interest-bearing deposit pricing for a given change in market interest rates. In\nup-rate scenarios, the deposit beta assumption is 30% with the pricing change occurring in the first month of the net interest income simulation horizon. In\ndown-rate scenarios, the deposit beta assumption is 50% with the pricing change occurring in the first month of the net interest income simulation horizon.\nActual changes to deposit pricing may vary significantly from this assumption due to management actions, customer behavior, and market forces, which may\nhave significant impacts to our net interest income. The net interest income simulations at September 30, 2024 project that interest-bearing liabilities reprice\nfaster than our interest earning assets.\nChange in Interest Rate Percent Change in Net Interest Income\n(basis points) September 30, 2024\n+200 (4.28)%\n+100 (1.94)\n-100 4.86\n-200 8.30\nThe preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results.\nThe Company uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. In August 2022, the Company entered into two interest rate\ncollars related to variable-rate loans that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $300.0 million. The collars designated as cash flow\nhedges synthetically fix the interest income received by the Company when the interest index falls below a floor rate on a rate reset and when the interest index\nexceeds the cap rate on a rate reset. In October 2022, the Company entered into four forward starting receive-fixed hedges related to pools of variable-rate loans\nand securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $850.0 million. The swaps designated as cash flow hedges synthetically\nfix the interest income received by the Company. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company voluntarily terminated three swaps, which were designated as\ncash flow hedges, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and one related to variable-rate securities with a total notional amount of $550.0 million. The\ntermination of the cash flow hedges resulted in a net unrealized loss totaling $0.2 million. The two interest rate collars and one remaining swap designated as\ncash flow hedges were effective with a total notional amount of $600.0 million. For more information regarding these financial derivative instruments, see “Note\n- Derivatives and Hedging Activities” in the accompanying “Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements” included in this report.\n62\nTable of Contents\nItem 4.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial\nOfficer (who is our principal financial officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in\nRule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), as of September 30, 2024. The term \"disclosure\ncontrols and procedures\" means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company\nin the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s\nrules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be\ndisclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including\nits principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nBased on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and\nprocedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized, and reported within the time periods required by the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management,\nincluding our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are\nreasonably likely to materially affect, such control.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nThe effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations,\nincluding cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of\nhuman error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these\nlimitations, any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud\nor in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.\n63\nTable of Contents\nPART II.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nItem 1.

When opening our first branch in\nSheridan, Wyoming, in 1968, commitment to community was established as a core value\nand priority.

We are intentional about following industry-leading\nprinciples and best practices, including many of the products and efficiencies as outlined\nin the Energy Star and LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards.\nAdditionally, we assess opportunities to fold in energy-efficient strategies and tactics for\nend-of-life capital replacements and for repair and maintenance needs.\nWith thoughtful analysis and a focus on efficiency and space optimization, we were able\nto reduce the Bank’s overall square footage by 166,534 square feet in 2023.

Business\nOur Company\nWe are a financial and bank holding company focused on community banking. Since our incorporation in Montana in\n1971, we have grown both organically and through strategic acquisitions. We operate 304 banking offices, including\nbranches and detached drive-up facilities, in communities across 14 states—Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,\nMinnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Through our\nbank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services—including\nonline and mobile banking—to individuals, businesses, government entities, and others throughout our market areas.\n2\nTable of Contents\nWe are proud to provide lending opportunities to clients that participate in a wide variety of industries, including:\n• Agriculture • Healthcare • Professional services • Technology\n• Construction • Hospitality • Real Estate Development • Tourism\n• Education • Housing • Retail • Wholesale trade\n• Governmental services\nHistorically, the Company’s authorized common stock had consisted of 200,000,000 shares, of which 100,000,000\nshares were designated as Class A common stock and 100,000,000 were designated as Class B common stock. The Class A\ncommon stock had one vote per share while the Class B common stock had five votes per share and was convertible to\nClass A common stock on a share-for-share basis. On March 24, 2022, the record date for our first annual stockholders’\nmeeting following the completion of the Great Western Bank (“GWB”) acquisition on February 1, 2022, all outstanding\nshares and rights to acquire shares of Class B common stock were automatically converted into the same number of\noutstanding shares and rights to acquire the same number of shares, as applicable, of Class A common stock. As a result,\nwe now have only one class of common stock outstanding and issuable upon exercise of outstanding rights to acquire\ncommon stock, all with equivalent voting rights: namely, common stock. The Class A common stock is traded on the\nNASDAQ stock market, or NASDAQ, under the symbol “FIBK.” Since our initial public offering, we have expanded our\nmarket reach through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, including our acquisitions of Mountain West Bank, United\nBank, N.A., Flathead Bank of Bigfork, Bank of the Cascades, Inland Northwest Bank, Idaho Independent Bank,\nCommunity 1st Bank, and GWB. As of December 31, 2023, we had consolidated assets of $30.7 billion, deposits of $23.3\nbillion, loans held for investment of $18.3 billion, and total stockholders’ equity of $3.2 billion.\nOur mission is to help people and their money work better together. With that as our guiding focus, we strive to be the\nmost relevant everyday experience our clients have with their money. With our focus on community banking, we adhere to\ncommon values that have long provided a foundation for our growth and success:\n(1) Put people first, always;\n(2) Seek greatness;\n(3) Demonstrate integrity;\n(4) Celebrate success; and\n(5) Be committed to our communities.\nThese values support our commitment to our employees, our clients, our communities, and our shareholders.\nOur business model is strategically focused around four key pillars, which help us align, organize, and prioritize\nbusiness strategies. These pillars guide our actions related to our employees, our clients, and our operations, ultimately\nleading to our financial success and creating value for our shareholders.\n• The first pillar is Our People, Our Priority. The success of our Company is a reflection of our people. We are\nbuilding a diverse company, attracting the right people, retaining them in the right jobs, and developing them to meet\nour long-term needs. Our people are informed, capable, and resilient.\n• The second pillar is Relentless Client Focus. Our client loyalty is cultivated by our focus on every interaction, every\ntime. By listening to our clients and learning about their needs, we are better able to connect their goals and dreams to\nthe right products and services.\n• The third pillar is Future Ready, Today. We live in a world in constant motion, which requires agility and resiliency;\nadapting our products and processes to be scalable and sustainable is essential. Robust and relevant systems and\nprocesses create a foundation for our employees to excel—not only in their personal performance, but in their\ndelivery of our products and services to our clients.\n• The fourth pillar is Financial Vitality. Our strategic focus on balance sheet management and goal-oriented financial\nrigor keeps us a top-performing bank. Our emphasis on accountability and our collaborative approach to aligning our\nefforts under our four pillars allows our community banking model to flourish.\nBy adhering to a strong set of values, we have significantly and strategically grown our business. Our long-term\nphilosophy emphasizes providing high-quality financial products and services, delivering exceptional client service,\ninfluencing business leadership within our communities through professional and dedicated bankers, supporting our\ncommunities through financial contributions and socially responsible leadership, and cultivating a strong corporate culture.\nWe plan to continue to advance our business in a disciplined and prudent manner, fueled by organic growth in our existing\nmarket areas and expansion into new and complementary markets when appropriate acquisition and other opportunities\narise.\n3\nTable of Contents\nCommunity Banking\nWe have one operating segment—community banking. Community banking encompasses commercial, governmental,\nand consumer banking services provided through our Bank: primarily the acceptance of deposits, the extension of credit,\nmortgage loan origination and servicing, and wealth management, which includes trust, employee benefit, investment\nmanagement, insurance, agency, and custodial services to individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Our\nphilosophy emphasizes a local focus through a personalized service approach while also strengthening the communities in\nour market areas through community involvement, service activities, and philanthropy. We grant our banking offices\nsignificant authority in delivering products in response to local market considerations and client needs. This autonomy\nenables our banking offices to remain competitive by quickly responding to local market conditions and enhancing\nrelationships with our clients in those markets. While our banking offices enjoy a level of flexibility, they remain\naccountable to company-wide standards and established limits on their authority and discretion. This combination of\nauthority and accountability allows our banking offices to provide personalized service and localized community support\nwhile at the same time remaining focused on our overall financial vitality.\nLending Activities\nWe offer real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural, and other loans to individuals, government entities, and\nbusinesses in our market areas. We have comprehensive credit policies that establish company-wide underwriting and\ndocumentation standards to manage the lending process and limit our risk. Each loan must meet minimum underwriting\nstandards specified in our credit policies and procedures, which generally specify that loans:\n(1) are made to borrowers generally located within or adjacent to our market footprint or own businesses and/or real\nestate within or adjacent to our footprint, with limited exceptions that may include participation loans and loans to\nnational accounts;\n(2) are made only for identified legal purposes;\n(3) have specifically identified sources of repayment;\n(4) mature within designated maximum maturity periods that coincide with repayment sources;\n(5) are appropriately collateralized whenever possible;\n(6) are supported by current credit information;\n(7) do not exceed the Bank’s legal lending limit;\n(8) include medium-term fixed interest rates or variable rates that are adjusted within designated time frames; and\n(9) require compliance with laws and regulations including a flood zone and risk determination prior to closing.\nIn addition, our credit policies include lending limitations to minimize concentrations of credit in agricultural,\ncommercial, real estate, or consumer loans. Furthermore, the criteria meeting our underwriting standards must be\ndocumented, with exceptions noted, as a part of the loan approval process.\nWhile each loan must meet minimum underwriting standards, qualified bankers are granted levels of credit authority for\napproving and pricing loans to assure that banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in\neach market area. Lending authorization is established at individual, branch, and market levels. Credit authorization is\nestablished and assigned based on the credit experience and credit acumen of each branch loan officer. Credit authorization\nis under the direction of our Chief Credit Officer or such officer’s designee and is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Credit\ngranted over the authority of our loan officers are approved by designated Credit Officers and/or the Chief Credit Officer\nwith the concurrence of our Chief Risk Officer as necessary.\nDeposit Products\nWe offer traditional depository products including checking, savings, and time deposits. Deposits at the Bank are\ninsured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, up to statutory limits. We also offer repurchase\nagreements primarily to commercial and municipal depositors. Under repurchase agreements, we sell investment securities\nheld by the Bank to our clients under an agreement to repurchase the investment securities at a specified time or on\ndemand. All outstanding repurchase agreements are due in one business day. Additionally, the Company is a member of\nthe IntraFi Network, which allows banking clients insured cash sweep products with access to FDIC insurance protection\non deposits that exceed FDIC insurance limits.\nWealth Management\nWe provide a wide range of trust, employee benefit, investment management, insurance, agency, and custodial services\nto individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. These services include the administration of estates and personal\ntrusts, management of investment accounts for individuals, employee benefit plans and charitable foundations, and\ninsurance planning.\n4\nTable of Contents\nCentralized Services\nWe have centralized certain operational activities to provide consistent service levels to our clients across the Bank,\nwhich helps us gain efficiency in management of those activities as well as ensure regulatory compliance. Centralized\noperational activities generally support our banking offices in the delivery of products and services to clients and include:\n• marketing;\n• credit review;\n• loan servicing;\n• credit card issuance and servicing;\n• mortgage loan sales and servicing;\n• indirect consumer loan purchasing and processing;\n• loan collections; and\n• other operational activities.\nAdditionally, specialized staff support services have been centralized to enable our branches to more efficiently serve\ntheir markets. These services include:\n• credit risk management;\n• finance;\n• human resource management;\n• internal audit;\n• facilities management;\n• technology;\n• risk management;\n• legal;\n• compliance; and\n• other support services.\nMarket Area\nThe following table reflects our deposit market share and branch locations by state:\nDeposit Market Share and Branch Locations by State % of Market Deposit Market Number of\nDeposits Share Rank Branches\n(1) (1) (2)\nArizona 0.3 21 9\nColorado 0.5 26 20\nIdaho 4.3 8 22\nIowa 1.9 9 45\nKansas 0.1 158 2\nMinnesota — 305 1\nMissouri 0.1 142 6\nMontana 16.6 2 42\nNebraska 2.5 7 44\nNorth Dakota 0.1 74 1\nOregon 2.5 9 33\nSouth Dakota 0.5 5 46\nWashington 0.4 29 18\nWyoming 13.7 1 15\nTotal 304\n(1) Source: FDIC.gov-data as of June 30, 2023.\n(2) As of December 31, 2023.\nWe operate in markets with a diverse employment base covering numerous industries and we believe our community\nbank approach to providing client service is a competitive advantage that strengthens the Company’s ability to effectively\nprovide financial products and services to businesses and individuals in its markets.\n5\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nThere is significant competition among commercial banks in our market areas. We also compete with other providers of\nfinancial services that actively engage in providing various types of loans and other financial services to their clients, such\nas:\n• savings and loan associations;\n• credit unions;\n• financial technology companies;\n• internet banks;\n• consumer finance companies;\n• brokerage firms;\n• mortgage banking companies;\n• insurance companies;\n• securities firms;\n• mutual funds;\n• government agencies; and\n• major retailers.\nTo remain competitive in this congested industry, we continue to develop our omni-channel experience across our\nwebsite, social media, and email, in addition to our offline channels, such as brick and mortar banking offices. Some of our\ncompetitors have greater resources and, as such, may have higher lending limits and may offer other services that we do not\nprovide. We generally compete on the basis of service and responsiveness to client needs, available loan and deposit\nproducts, rates of interest charged on loans, rates of interest paid for deposits, and the availability and pricing of services\nsuch as trust, employee benefit, investment, and insurance services.\nGovernment Regulation and Supervision\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision under federal and state laws. Summaries of the\nmaterial laws and regulations that are applicable to us are provided below. The descriptions that follow are not intended to\nsummarize all laws and regulations applicable to us. Furthermore, the descriptions that follow do not purport to be\ncomplete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full provisions of those laws and regulations. In addition to\nlaws and regulations, state and federal banking regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters, and\nsimilar written guidance that may impose additional regulatory obligations or otherwise affect the conduct of our business.\nAdditionally, proposals to change laws and regulations are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The\nlikelihood and timing of any such changes and their impact on the Company cannot be determined with certainty.\nRegulatory Authorities\nAs a public company with our securities listed for trading on the NASDAQ stock market, we are subject to the\ndisclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, including under the Securities\nAct of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the rules and\nlisting standards of the NASDAQ stock market.\nAs a financial and bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,\nas amended, and to supervision, regulation, and regular examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (the “Federal Reserve”).\nThe Bank is subject to supervision and regular examination by its primary banking regulators, the Federal Reserve and\nthe Montana Department of Administration, Division of Banking and Financial Institutions (the “Montana Division”). The\nBank is also subject to supervision and examination by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).\nThe Bank’s deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) administered by the FDIC in the manner and to\nthe extent provided by law. As such, the Bank is subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”) and FDIC\nregulations relating to deposit insurance and may also be subject to supervision and examination by the FDIC.\nWe are currently subject to the regulatory capital framework and guidelines reached by Basel III as adopted by the\nFederal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has risk-based capital adequacy guidelines intended to measure capital adequacy\nwith regard to a banking organization’s balance sheet, including off-balance sheet exposures such as unused portions of\nloan commitments, letters of credit, and recourse arrangements.\nThe extensive regulation of the Bank limits both the activities in which the Bank may engage and the conduct of its\npermitted activities. Further, the laws and regulations impose reporting and information collection obligations on the Bank.\nThe Bank incurs significant costs relating to compliance with various laws and regulations and the collection and retention\nof information. As the regulatory framework for bank holding companies and banks continues to evolve and become more\ncomplex, the cost of complying with regulatory requirements continues to increase.\n6\nTable of Contents\nFinancial and Bank Holding Company\nFirst Interstate is a bank holding company and has registered as a financial holding company under regulations issued\nby the Federal Reserve. As a financial holding company, we may engage in business activities that are determined by the\nFederal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities as well as all activities authorized generally to\nbank holding companies. We may continue to engage in authorized financial activities provided that we remain a financial\nholding company and are “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.” We do not currently engage in significant financial\nholding company business or activities not otherwise permitted generally for bank holding companies.\nUnder federal law, First Interstate is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank,\nwhich may include providing financial assistance to the Bank if the Bank experiences financial distress. Under existing\nFederal Reserve source of strength policies, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital\ninjections into a troubled subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may also determine that the bank holding company is\nengaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to a subsidiary bank.\nWe are required by the Bank Holding Company Act to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring, directly or\nindirectly, ownership or control of voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, we would own or control more than\n5% of its voting stock. The Federal Reserve considers a number of factors in evaluating acquisitions, including the\nfinancial and managerial resources and future prospects of the parties, the convenience and needs of the communities\nserved, and competitive factors. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the\n“Dodd-Frank Act”), when considering an application, the Federal Reserve is also required to evaluate whether the\ntransaction would result in more concentrated risks to the United States banking or financial system. Under federal law and\nregulations, a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state if, among other things, the bank\nholding company is both “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” both before and after the acquisition.\nBanks may also merge across state lines. With additional changes made to federal statutes under the Dodd-Frank Act,\nbanks are also permitted to establish new interstate branches if a bank located in the target state could establish a new\nbranch at the proposed location without regard to state laws limiting interstate de novo branching. A state can prohibit\ninterstate mergers entirely or prohibit them if the continuing bank would control insured bank deposits in excess of a\nspecified percentage of total insured bank deposits in the state. Under Montana law, a bank cannot acquire control of a\nbank located in Montana if, after the acquisition, the acquiring institution would control, in the aggregate, more than 30%\nof the total deposits of insured depository institutions located in Montana. As of June 30, 2023, based on publicly available\ninformation provided by the FDIC, we believe the Bank controlled approximately 16.6% of the total deposits of all insured\ndepository institutions located in Montana. As such, the state limitation may limit our ability to directly or indirectly\nacquire additional banks located in Montana.\nIn order to assess the financial strength of the bank holding company, the Federal Reserve and the State of Montana\nmay conduct periodic on-site and off-site inspections and credit reviews throughout the year. The federal banking agencies,\nincluding the Federal Reserve, may require additional information and reports from us. In addition, the Federal Reserve\nmay examine, and require reports and information regarding, any entity that we control, including entities other than banks\nor entities engaged in financial activities. In certain circumstances, the Federal Reserve may require us to divest of non-\nbank entities or limit the activities of those entities even if the activities are otherwise permitted to bank holding companies\nunder governing law.\nDividends and Restrictions on Transfers of Funds\nDividends from the Bank are the primary source of funds for the payment of our operating expenses and for the\npayment of dividends to our shareholders. Dividends are also limited by state and federal laws and regulations. We are also\nsubject to various regulatory restrictions relating to capital distributions, including dividends, regulatory capital minimums,\nand the requirement to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized below under\nthe caption “Business – Government Regulation and Supervision – Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action.” In\ngeneral, the Bank is limited to paying dividends that do not exceed the current year net profits together with retained\nearnings from the two preceding calendar years unless prior consent of the Federal Reserve is obtained. In addition, the\nBank may not pay dividends in excess of the previous two years’ net earnings without providing notice to the Montana\nDivision.\nThe capital buffer rules adopted by the federal banking regulators in accordance with the Basel Accords impose further\nlimitations on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends. In general, the Bank’s ability to pay dividends is limited under the\ncapital buffer rules unless the Bank’s common equity conservation buffer exceeds the minimum required capital ratio by\n2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nA state or federal banking regulator may also impose, by regulatory order or agreement of the Bank, specific dividend\nlimitations or prohibitions. The Bank is not, however, currently subject to a specific regulatory dividend limitation.\n7\nTable of Contents\nThe Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common\nstock by bank holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings\nand only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s\ncapital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation\nwith respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four\nquarters (net of previous capital distributions) is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of\nearnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding\ncompany to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes under-capitalized. The policy statement also\nstates that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing\ncommon stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the\nrepurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity\ninstruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These\nregulatory policies may affect our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock, or otherwise engage in\ncapital distributions.\nCapital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and\nfederal banking agencies, which involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items\ncalculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative\njudgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. The capital requirements are intended to\nensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial\ninstruments and are applied separately to the Bank and its parent holding company.\nFederal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions and bank holding companies to meet several minimum\ncapital standards:\n• a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%;\n• a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%;\n• a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%; and\n• a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.\nThe existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015, and are based on recommendations of the Basel\nCommittee on Banking Supervision and requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nFor purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common\nstockholders’ equity and retained earnings and is reduced by substantially all of the regulatory deductions including items\nsuch as goodwill and other intangibles and certain deferred tax assets. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity\nTier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred\nstock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1\ncapital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is composed of capital\ninstruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term\nperpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt. Also\nincluded in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for credit losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for\ninstitutions like us that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive\nIncome (“AOCI”), up to 45.0% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair\nmarket values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1\ncapital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital\nis subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets,\nincluding certain off-balance sheet assets (for example, recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are\nmultiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset.\nHigher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of\n0% is assigned to cash and United States government securities, a risk weight of 50% generally is assigned to prudently\nunderwritten first lien one- to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and\nconsumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans, and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is\nassigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.\n8\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and\ncertain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer”\nconsisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its\nminimum risk-based capital requirements. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the Federal Reserve takes into\nconsideration not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital\nrequirements in individual cases where deemed necessary. The Federal Reserve has not established individual capital\nrequirements applicable to us.\nFederal law requires the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository\ninstitutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The law sets forth the following five capital tiers:\n• “well capitalized;”\n• “adequately capitalized;”\n• “under-capitalized;”\n• “significantly under-capitalized;” and\n• “critically under-capitalized.”\nA depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital\nmeasures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the common equity tier 1\ncapital ratio, total capital ratio, the tier 1 capital ratio, and the leverage ratio.\nA depository institution is generally prohibited from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend)\nor paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be under-\ncapitalized. Under-capitalized institutions may be subject to growth limitations and other restrictions and are required to\nsubmit a capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is\n“significantly under-capitalized.”\n“Significantly under-capitalized” depository institutions are subject to additional requirements and restrictions, such as\norders to sell sufficient stock to become “adequately capitalized,” to reduce total assets, restrict interest rates paid, remove\nmanagement and directors, and cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. “Critically under-capitalized”\ninstitutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.\nThe capital stock of banks organized under Montana law, such as the Bank, may be subject to assessment upon the\ndirection of the Montana Department of Administration under the Montana Bank Act. Under the Montana Bank Act, if the\nDepartment of Administration determines an impairment of a bank’s capital exists, it may notify the bank’s board of\ndirectors of the impairment and require payment of an assessment on the bank stock. If the bank fails to do so, the\nDepartment of Administration may, among other things, take charge of the bank and proceed to liquidate the bank.\nRestrictions on Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, and Officers\nUnder the Federal Reserve Act, the Bank may not lend funds or otherwise extend credit to its parent holding company\nor any other affiliate, except on specified types and amounts of collateral generally upon market terms and conditions. The\nFederal Reserve also has authority to define and limit the transactions between banks and their affiliates. The Federal\nReserve’s Regulation W and relevant federal statutes and regulations, among other authorities, impose significant\nlimitations on transactions in which the Bank may engage with us or with other affiliates, including per-affiliate and\naggregate limits on affiliate transactions.\nFederal Reserve Regulation O restricts loans to the Bank and its parent holding company’s insiders, which includes\ndirectors, certain officers, and principal shareholders and their respective related interests. All extensions of credit to the\ninsiders and their related interests must be on the same terms as, and subject to the same loan underwriting requirements as,\nloans to persons who are not insiders. In addition, Regulation O imposes lending limits on loans to insiders and their\nrelated interests and imposes, in certain circumstances, requirements for prior approval of the loans by the Bank board of\ndirectors.\nSafety and Soundness Standards and Other Supervisory and Enforcement Mechanisms\nThe federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness, asset quality\nand earnings, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, internal controls, and audit systems.\nThese standards are designed to identify potential concerns and ensure action is taken to address those concerns before they\npose a risk to the DIF. If a federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any of these standards, the\nagency may require the institution to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the institution\nfails to submit an acceptable plan within the time allowed by the agency or fails in any material respect to implement an\naccepted plan, the agency must, by order, require the institution to correct the deficiency and may take other supervisory\naction.\n9\nTable of Contents\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking regulators impose additional supervisory measures on banking\norganizations such as us when they exceed $10 billion in assets. These include enhanced risk management and corporate\ngovernance processes specified by the regulators.\nThe Federal Reserve has authority to bring an enforcement action against a bank or bank holding company and all\n“institution-affiliated parties” of a bank or bank holding company, including directors, officers, stockholders, and under\ncertain circumstances, attorneys, appraisers, and accountants for the bank or holding company. Formal enforcement actions\nmay include measures such as the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order for the removal of officers and/or\ndirectors or the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and\nactions, and can range up to $5,000 per day, unless a finding of knowing or reckless disregard is made, in which case\npenalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or\nrecommend to the Federal Reserve that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular bank. If such action is not\ntaken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. Montana law also provides the Montana\nDivision with various enforcement mechanisms and, ultimately, authority to appoint a receiver or conservator for a\nMontana bank.\nDeposit Insurance\nThe FDIC insures our client deposits through the DIF up to $250,000 per depositor. The amount of FDIC assessments\npaid by each DIF member institution is based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from a statistical\nmodel estimating the probability of failure within a three-year period, with banks deemed more risky paying higher\nassessments.\nThe FDIC was required by the Dodd-Frank Act to take actions necessary to cause the DIF to reach a reserve ratio of\n1.35% of total estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020. On September 30, 2018, the DIF Reserve Ratio reached\n1.36%. As of September 30, 2020, the FDIC had announced that the ratio had declined to 1.30% due largely to\nconsequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDIC adopted a plan to restore the fund to the 1.35% ratio within eight\nyears, but did not change its assessment schedule. On October 18, 2022, the FDIC finalized a rule that would increase\ninitial base deposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points, beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of\n2023.\nIn addition, to recover costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors during the bank failures in the first half of\n2023, in November 2023, the FDIC implemented a 13.4 basis point annual special assessment on uninsured deposits above\n$5 billion, to be collected during an anticipated eight consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2024. The\nCompany accrued $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 for the special assessment. The ultimate impact and timing of\nrecognition will depend on the final outcome of the ongoing FDIC deliberations. The special assessment is in addition to\nthe assessment rates finalized as part of FDIC’s Amended Restoration Plan. As of June 30, 2023, the DIF balance was $117\nbillion and the DIF Reserve Ratio had decreased from 1.25% as of December 31, 2022 to 1.1% as of June 30, 2023.\nDespite this decrease, caused in part by the costs associated with the bank failures in the first half of 2023, the FDIC\nprojects that the DIF Reserve Ratio will reach the statutory minimum ahead of the statutory deadline of September 30,\n2028, consistent with the FDIC’s Amended Restoration Plan which became effective as of January 1, 2023.\nAll FDIC-insured institutions are also required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds\nissued by the Financing Corporation, or the FICO, an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the\npredecessor to the DIF. The assessment rate is applied to total average assets less tangible equity, as defined under the\nDodd-Frank Act. The assessment rate schedule can change from time-to-time at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to\ncertain limits. Under the current system, premiums are assessed quarterly.\nInterchange Fees\nUnder the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, also known as Regulation II, the Federal Reserve adopted rules\nestablishing standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic\ndebit transactions are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions, which\nalters the competitive structure of the debit card payment processing industry and caps debit card interchange fees for\nbanks with over $10 billion in assets. Interchange fees are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks\nfor processing electronic payment transactions. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that\nrequire issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. On October 3,\n2022, the Federal Reserve finalized a rule that amends Regulation II to specify, among other things, that debit card issuers\nshould enable all debit card transactions, including card-not-present transactions such as online payments, to be processed\non at least two unaffiliated payment card networks. The final rule became effective July 1, 2023. In October 2023, the\nFederal Reserve proposed revising Regulation II to lower the cap from its current rate of 21 cents and .05% of the\ntransaction, plus a one-cent fraud-prevention adjustment, to 14.4 cents and .04% per transaction and a 1.3 cents fraud-\nprevention adjustment, effective June 30, 2025. We are subject to the interchange fee cap and having at least two\nunaffiliated payment card networks because our assets exceed $10 billion.\n10\nTable of Contents\nClient Privacy and Other Consumer Protections\nFederal and State laws impose client privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities, including\nus. Under these requirements, a financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of clients’\nnonpublic personal information. In addition, for clients who obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal, family,\nor household purposes, a financial holding company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the client at the time the\nrelationship is established and annually thereafter. The financial company must also disclose its policies concerning the\nsharing of the client’s nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties. Finally, a financial company is\nprohibited from disclosing an account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing, direct mail\nmarketing, or marketing through electronic mail.\nThe Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state laws, regulations, and reporting obligations aimed at protecting\nconsumers and Bank clients. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may, among other things, impair the\ncollection of loans made in violation of the laws and regulations, provide borrowers or other clients certain rights and\nremedies, or result in the imposition of penalties on the Bank. Certain of these laws and regulations are described below.\nThe Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in credit transactions on, among other things, the\nbasis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age and, in certain circumstances, limits the Bank’s\nability to require co-obligors or guarantors as a condition of the extension of credit to an individual.\nThe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) requires certain disclosures be provided to borrowers in real\nestate loan closings or other real estate settlements. In addition, RESPA limits or prohibits certain settlement practices, fee\nsharing, “kickbacks,” and similar practices that are considered to be abusive.\nThe Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”) requires disclosures to borrowers and other parties in consumer loans, including,\namong other things, disclosures relating to interest rates and other finance charges, payments and payment schedules, and\nannual percentage rates.\nThe Fair Housing Act regulates, among other things, lending practices in residential housing and prohibits\ndiscrimination in housing-related lending activities on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap,\ndisability, or familial status.\nThe Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires certain lenders and other firms engaged in the home mortgage industry to\ncollect and report information relating to applicants, borrowers, and home mortgage lending activities in which they engage\nin their market areas or communities. The information is used for, among other purposes, evaluation of discrimination or\nother impermissible acts in home mortgage lending.\nThe Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act regulates terms and disclosures of certain closed-end home mortgage\nloans that are not purchase money loans and includes loans classified as “high-cost loans.”\nThe Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, generally limits lenders\nand other financial firms in their collection, use, or dissemination of client credit information, gives clients some access to,\nand control over, their credit information, and requires financial firms to establish policies and procedures intended to deter\nidentity theft and related frauds.\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act regulates actions that may be taken in the collection of consumer debts and\nprovides consumers with certain rights of access to information related to collection actions.\nThe Electronic Fund Transfer Act regulates fees and other terms on electronic funds transactions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act prohibits, among other things, lending practices to\nconsumers that are unfair, deceptive, or abusive.\nThe CFPB has promulgated numerous regulations relating to consumer financial services-related topics, such as\nmortgage origination disclosures, mortgage servicing practices, and others.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a\nfinancial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low- and moderate-income\nneighborhoods. In addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be assessed for a violation of fair\nlending laws, the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and the CRA into account when evaluating\napplications for transactions such as mergers and for new branches.\nIn connection with its assessment of CRA performance, the appropriate bank regulatory agency assigns a rating of\n“outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial noncompliance.” The Bank received an “outstanding”\nrating on its most recently published CRA examination. Although the Bank’s policies and procedures are designed to\nachieve compliance with all fair lending and CRA requirements, instances of non-compliance are occasionally identified\nthrough normal operational activities. Management endeavors to respond proactively to any instances of non-compliance\nand to implement and update appropriate procedures to prevent instances of non-compliance and other violations from\noccurring.\n11\nTable of Contents\nUSA PATRIOT Act\nThe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and the Money Laundering Control Act of\n1986 and adopted additional measures requiring insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial\ninstitutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing. The laws and related regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law\nenforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes.\nFederal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition or merger applications, to take\ninto account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants.\nOffice of Foreign Asset Control\nThe United States Treasury Office of Foreign Asset Control enforces economic and trade sanctions imposed by the\nUnited States on foreign persons and governments. Among other authorities, the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or\nOFAC, may require United States financial institutions to block or “freeze” assets of identified foreign persons or\ngovernments which come within the control of the financial institution. Financial institutions are required to adopt\nprocedures for identification of new and existing deposit accounts and other relationships with persons or governments\nidentified by OFAC and to timely report the accounts or relationships to OFAC.\nIncentive Compensation\nIn May 2016, the Federal Reserve Board, other federal banking agencies, and the SEC jointly published a re-proposed\nrule-making designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements\nthat would encourage inappropriate risk taking at a covered institution, which includes a bank or bank holding company\nwith $1 billion or more of assets, such as us. The proposed rule (i) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements\nthat encourage executive officers, employees, directors, or principal shareholders to expose the institution to inappropriate\nrisks by providing excessive compensation (based on the standards for excessive compensation adopted pursuant to the\nFDIA) and (ii) prohibits incentive-based compensation arrangements for executive officers, employees, directors or\nprincipal shareholders that could lead to a material financial loss for the institution. The proposed rule requires covered\ninstitutions to establish policies and procedures for monitoring and evaluating their compensation practices. The comment\nperiod ended in July 2016, but the SEC is expected to resurrect this issue as a new proposed rule in 2024. Although final\nrules had not been adopted as of as of December 31, 2023, if these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to the\nproposed rule-making, they could impose limitations on the manner in which we may structure compensation for our\nexecutives.\nCybersecurity\nFederal regulators have issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial\ninstitutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and ensure their risk management\nprocesses also address the risk posed by compromised client credentials, including security measures to reliably\nauthenticate clients accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a\nfinancial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the\nrapid recovery, resumption, and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive\nmalware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business\noperations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers\nfall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various\nregulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.\nFor additional discussion on cybersecurity, see Part I, Item 1C, “Cybersecurity” included herein.\nHuman Capital\nCulture is critically important to the Company’s success; our people are our number one priority. We approach our\nculture with an aspirational lens. It is not a stand-alone initiative or program—it is integrated in our systems, our processes,\nand our DNA. Our values guide how we make decisions, treat each other, and serve our clients.\nEmployee Base\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed 3,585 full-time equivalent employees, with none represented by a collective\nbargaining agreement. This represents a decrease of 198 employees from December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2023,\napproximately 68.2% of our workforce was female, 31.6% was male, and 0.2% have not declared. The executive team is\ncomprised of 75.0% female and 25.0% male, and the Company’s senior leadership team was 45.5% female and 54.5%\nmale.\n12\nTable of Contents\nCommitment to Community / Volunteerism\nWe are “all-in” when it comes to giving back—with time, money, and heart. We have a vested interest in the strength of\nour communities and strive to make them better places to live and work. Each year, the Company creates commitment to\ncommunity plans for all our markets, which includes donating a portion of our net income before tax for charitable\npurposes. These plans help align strategies for philanthropy, volunteering and leadership, financial education outreach,\ncommunity development, and sustainability.\nWe encourage employees to take active leadership roles within their communities to further demonstrate our values and\nhelp us respond to the needs of the markets we serve. The Company provides employees an opportunity to participate in a\nBank-sponsored service project annually, marking the second Wednesday in September as our Commitment to Community\nVolunteer Day. We close all offices in the afternoon on Volunteer Day so employees can lend a hand in their community,\neither as teams or as individuals.\nEmployee Engagement\nOur employee engagement strategy is focused on creating and maintaining a work environment where all employees’\nvoices are heard. The organization’s success is measured by assessing the consistency in which we meet workplace needs\nand the activation of progress by local-level leaders. An annual census survey is conducted each fall and strategic pulse\nsurveys help us dig deeper into organizational nuances, allowing us to gain additional insight into the needs of our\norganization and task appropriate departments with creating solutions.\nLeaders in our organization are held accountable for encouraging participation, reviewing and sharing team results,\nholding action-oriented engagement discussions, and submitting an annual action plan to encourage engagement\nthroughout the year. Aggregated employee engagement data is provided to the Board of Directors as a key indicator of the\nhealth of our workforce.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe strive to provide competitive wages, benefits, and programs that meet the varying needs of our workforce. We\ncontinually review our programs to ensure we remain competitive and take care of our employees. In 2023, we increased\nthe salary threshold for the Childcare Assistance Program (CCAP) from $60,000 to $70,000. We added a second Dental\nPlan option giving our employees a more affordable option. To our VSP vision Plan we added VSP Lightcare which gives\nnon-prescription wearers a sun glass or blue light filtering glass option.\nOur compensation strategies are designed to pay for performance, pay competitively within our markets, and support\npay equity among comparable jobs and markets across the company. We make data-driven decisions regarding employee\ncompensation based on the job, experience, and performance.\nThe approach we take in our benefit offerings is a holistic one to address our employees’ total well-being, which\nincludes aspects of their health, physical, mental/emotional, social, and financial needs.\nWe offer the following compensation and benefit programs as part of our total rewards package:\n• Competitive Total Compensation\n• Base salary\n• Pay for performance short-term and long-term incentive programs for eligible employees\n• Comprehensive Benefit Programs\n• Medical, dental, and vision plans\n• 401(k) plan with a 100% match on the first 6% contributed\n• Paid time off\n• Health savings accounts with employer contribution\n• Flexible spending accounts\n• Company paid childcare assistance program\n• Student debt employer repayment program\n• Additional Benefits: short-term disability; long-term disability; employee assistance program; free or discounted\nbanking products and services; wellness program; and flexible work arrangements\nGrowth and Development\nIn our ongoing commitment to fostering a dynamic and competitive workforce, we have dedicated significant time and\nresources to nurture our talent. In 2023, we made strides in employee development, offering multifaceted development\nprograms centered around neuroscience and emotional intelligence. This initiative was complimented by role-based\ntraining programs and on-demand learning opportunities and resources, reinforcing our commitment to equipping our\nworkforce with the skills needed to excel in our markets. We have expanded our Individual Development plan process and\ninstituted executive coaching programs for successors, ensuring preparedness for the future.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nWe work to foster a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, not only within our Company, but within the\ncommunities where we live and work. We take pride in creating a workplace environment that values our employees for\ntheir differences while ensuring equity in all we do. We are committed to advocating for the rights and respect of all and\nactively participate in achieving this by setting an example.\nIn 2023 the Company focused its efforts on education, employee connection, and communications. We expanded our\nDEI Council to ensure further geographic representation and formalized our Council Governance. We championed DEI\ninitiatives in the communities we serve and engaged with new partners to ensure we are recruiting and retaining diverse\ntalent across our footprint. Kevin Riley, CEO and President, signed the CEO Action Pledge that aligns First Interstate Bank\nwith 2,000 other organizations which pledge to take action to cultivate environments where diverse experiences and\nperspectives are welcomed.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we invited all employees to complete our customized LinkedIn Learning Path. During\nthat time frame, 2,870 employees completed the Learning Path. This Learning Path has been added to new employee\nonboarding materials to provide them the opportunity to experience the same robust learning opportunities our existing\nemployees received. This Learning Path serves as the foundation for our 3-part Leading the Way to DEI training, our in-\nhouse training program. In 2022, our DEI Council, HR team, and Executive and Senior Leadership Team participated in\nthe first iterations of Leading the Way. We then rolled the training out to the people leaders in our company with multiple\nsession options over a 3-month period; over 600 leaders participated in Leading the Way training. We created bridge\nresources for managers to use with their teams to prepare them for the Leading the Way training that will be rolled out to\nall employees in the spring of 2024.\nWe also spent time updating and refining our DEI resources and communications both internally and externally. We\nlaunched the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion page of our corporate site to further the visibility of our commitment to our\ncommunities and potential candidates. We invested time in our internal intranet page to provide additional resources and\nalign our internal and external DEI messaging.\nWe continued our Collective Learning Series where we host a monthly educational and community-building webinar\nseries. These hour-long, web-based connections allow for a more in-depth look into the DEI topics we have explored in\nInet articles, as well as other topics employees and leaders are passionate and curious about. The Collective Learning Series\nis an opportunity to show the explicit link between our Mission to help people and their money work better together and\nDEI. In 2023, we engaged employees at every level of the Company on topics ranging from Heritage month celebrations to\nNeurodiversity to mental health. Over 1,400 employees attended in 2023.\nWe believe that when nobody gets left behind, everybody moves forward. We are committed to moving forward with\nour work while making an impact and difference for our communities and employees.\nWebsite Access to SEC Filings\nThe Company’s electronic filings with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form\n10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and Proxy Statements, as well as amendments to these reports and statements filed or\nfurnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, are made available at no cost through our website at\nwww.FIBK.com by clicking through the “Financials” tab found there and selecting “SEC Filings,” as soon as reasonably\npracticable after the Company files such material with, or furnishes such materials to, the SEC.

Risk Factors\nLike other financial institutions and bank holding companies, the success of our business is subject to a number of risks\nand uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. The material risks and uncertainties of which we are currently\naware are set forth below under headings that are provided for convenience and intended to organize the risks and\nuncertainties into related categories to improve readability for investors; no inference should be drawn, however, that the\nplacement of a risk factor under a particular category means it is not applicable to another category of risks or that it may\nbe more or less material than another risk factor. Regardless, if any of the events or circumstances described below\nactually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not\nthe only ones we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and\nfinancial services industry in general and us in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may\nharm our future business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. You should consider carefully the\nfollowing important factors in evaluating us and our business before you make an investment decision about our securities.\n14\nTable of Contents\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks\nNew governmental regulations and/or changes in existing governmental regulations could have a material adverse\neffect on the Company.\nThe Company is extensively regulated under federal and state banking laws and regulations that are intended primarily\nfor the protection of clients, the DIF, and the banking system. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity\nof the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years in response, we believe, to various factors\nincluding the 2008 financial crisis as well as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have\nalso increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the\nDodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations. The Company expects its business will remain subject to extensive\nregulation and supervision.\nRegulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, employment, monetary, and other\nlaws and regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which we conduct business,\nimplement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. In addition, the\nCompany is subject to changes in federal and state laws as well as changes in banking and credit regulations and\ngovernmental economic and monetary policies. Congress may enact legislation from time-to-time that affects the\nregulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time-to-time affecting the\nregulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also\nperiodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the application of existing regulations. In recent\nyears, the CFPB has increased its scrutiny of fee-based business models and various fees on consumer financial products\nand services, including depositor, overdraft and late fee charges. For example, in February 2023, the CFPB proposed\nchanges that would limit the amount of late fees that could be charged for late credit card payments. Certain elements of the\nfederal government have also expressed an interest in increased regulation of these types of fees. Any of these changes or\nnew legislation could increase our future compliance and other operating expenses and could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nNegative developments in the banking industry could result in increased regulatory scrutiny.\nHigh profile bank failures in 2023 have led to disruption and volatility, including deposit outflows and an increased\nneed for liquidity at some banks. Events involving adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional\ncounterparties or other companies in the banking industry, or concerns or rumors about these or similar events, have in the\npast and may in the future lead to erosion of confidence in the banking system, deposit volatility, liquidity issues, stock\nprice volatility, and other adverse developments.\nThe recent negative developments in the banking industry are expected to result in modifications to or additional laws\nand regulations governing banks and bank holding companies. These may include, an increase in capital requirements,\nmodifications to regulatory requirements with respect to liquidity risk management, increased supervision over deposit\nconcentrations, enhanced capital adequacy requirements, more stress testing and contingency planning requirements,\nimplementation of other safe and sound banking practices, or other enhanced supervisory or enforcement activities. Other\nlegislative initiatives could detrimentally impact our operations in the future. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations or view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past, or\ncommence investigations or inquiries into our business practices. Increased regulatory scrutiny, whether by virtue of new\nregulations (if any) or during routine examinations, could increase our cost of doing business and reduce our profitability.\nAmong other things, there may be increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of\nuninsured deposits, collateralized deposits, brokered deposits, unrealized losses in securities portfolios, liquidity,\ncommercial real estate composition and concentration, and capital and general oversight and control of the foregoing.\nTax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in the various state and local jurisdictions where we\noperate. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations.\nAlthough management believes our positions are reasonable, we are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service in the\nUnited States and by state and local tax authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations. While\nwe believe we comply with all applicable tax laws, rules, and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities\nmay determine that we owe additional taxes or apply existing laws and regulations differently, which could result in a\nsignificant increase in liabilities for taxes and interest in excess of accrued liabilities and harm our business and financial\ncondition.\n15\nTable of Contents\nNew tax legislative initiatives, including increases in the corporate tax rate, may be enacted, negatively impacting our\neffective tax rate at the federal and state level, and potentially adversely affecting our tax positions or tax liabilities. For\nexample, the U.S. has implemented a 15% minimum tax on corporations and a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks.\nWe have adopted and completed material share repurchase programs over the past several years as a means by which to\nreturn value to shareholders, and the new excise tax may have a material and negative impact on our willingness to engage\nin such programs in the future or may materially increase our costs associated with engaging in any such programs to the\nextent we determine to engage in them in the future. In addition, unilateral or multi-jurisdictional actions by various tax\nauthorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. In any event,\nsignificant uncertainties exist with respect to the amount of our tax liabilities, including those arising from potential and\nalready implemented changes in tax laws. These and other tax related items could increase our future tax expense, could\nchange our future intentions regarding the use of our earnings, and could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements in the future, the impact of which could have a material\nrisk to our operations.\nFederal and state banking regulators possess broad powers to take supervisory actions as they deem appropriate. These\nsupervisory actions may result in higher capital requirements, higher deposit insurance premiums, and limitations on the\nCompany’s activities that could have a material adverse effect on its business and profitability. For example, the FDIC and\nthe federal banking agencies approved a new rule that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules\napplicable to us by adopting “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe Basel III-based U.S. capital rules, among other things, impose a capital measure called Common Equity Tier 1\nCapital, or CET1 capital, to which most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures must be made. In addition,\nthe Basel III-based U.S. capital rules specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital”\ninstruments meeting certain specified requirements.\nUnder the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules, the minimum capital ratios are:\n• 4.5% CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets;\n• 6.0% tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets;\n• 8.0% total capital (that is, tier 1 capital plus tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and\n• 4.0% tier 1 capital to total average consolidated assets as defined under U.S. Basel III Standardized approach\n(known as the “leverage ratio”).\nThe minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for us on January 1, 2015, refined the\ndefinition of what constitutes “capital” for calculating these ratios. The rule required unrealized gains and losses on certain\n“available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-\nout is exercised. In addition, the final rule established a “capital conservation buffer” that, once fully phased in and\ncombined with established minimum common equity, risk-based assets capital, and total capital ratios, will exceed the\nprompt corrective action “well-capitalized” thresholds (According to the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991, a depository\ninstitution is “well-capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater; a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of\n8.0% or greater; a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater; a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater; and is\nnot subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital\nmeasure.).\nIn January 2019, the phase-in of the capital conservation buffer requirement was completed. An institution will be\nsubject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital\nlevel falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that\ncan be utilized for such actions.\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-\ncrisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV”). Changes include, among other things:\n• Changes to risk-weights under the standardized approach\n• Restrictions on the use of models under the advanced approaches\n• Revisions to the credit valuation adjustment risk framework\n• An overhaul of the operational risk framework, including a more explicit operational risk capital charge under the\nstandardized approach\n• Refinements to the leverage ratio framework\n• Creation of an output floor on the regulatory capital benefits that a banking organization using the advanced\napproaches can derive relative to the standardized approach\n16\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2022, the federal banking regulators announced their intent to revise U.S. regulatory capital requirements\nto align with Basel IV requirements, more recently referred to as the Basel III “Endgame,” and in July 2023 issued a notice\nof proposed rulemaking for comment that would substantially revise the regulatory capital framework for banking\norganizations with total assets of $100 billion or more and their depository institutions subsidiaries and banking\norganizations with significant trading activity. The proposal would not amend the capital requirements applicable to\nsmaller, less complex banking organizations. It is unclear, however, when further guidance will become available and when\nany changes will go into effect. The impact of Basel IV will depend upon the way it is implemented in the U.S. with\nrespect to institutions like First Interstate and FIB.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially negatively impact our financial statements.\nFrom time-to-time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) and the SEC change the financial accounting\nand reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how\nwe record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the FASB issued amendments to its\nguidance on the credit impairment of financial instruments. The amendments were effective for fiscal year 2020, which\nintroduced a new impairment model based on current expected credit losses (“CECL”) rather than incurred losses. As a\nresult of the amendments, we increased our allowance for credit losses, which had a significant impact on our results of\noperations.\nAny failure to comply with laws and regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and fair lending\nlaws, could lead to material penalties.\nWe must comply with the CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, and other fair lending laws\nand regulations that impose non-discriminatory lending and other requirements on financial institutions. A failure to\ncomply with these laws could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil\nmoney penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on\nexpansion. In addition to actions by the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies, including the Federal\nReserve and CFPB, who are responsible for enforcing these laws, our compliance with fair lending laws could be\nchallenged in private class action litigation. The costs of defending any such challenge and any adverse outcome arising\nfrom such a challenge could damage our reputation or could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, OFAC guidelines and requirements, the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), and\nrelated Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) and Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council\n(“FFIEC”) Guidelines and regulations and any failure to comply with them could result in material implications that\ncould harm our business.\nWe are routinely examined by our regulators for compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, OFAC guidelines and\nrequirements, the BSA, and related FinCEN and FFIEC Guidelines. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs\nand fully comply with relevant laws or regulations could have serious legal, financial, and reputational consequences for\nus, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when\nregulatory approval is required, or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities\nhave imposed cease and desist orders and significant civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these\nregulations. If any of the foregoing were to come to pass, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be\nmaterially and adversely affected.\nFederal deposit insurance premiums could increase further in the future.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured\nfinancial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a specific level. Historically, unfavorable economic conditions\nincreased bank failures and these additional bank failures decreased the DIF. Extraordinary growth in insured deposits\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic caused the ratio of the DIF to total insured deposits to fall below the current statutory\nminimum of 1.35%. To restore the DIF to its statutorily mandated minimums, the FDIC significantly increased deposit\ninsurance premium rates, including the Bank's premium rates, resulting in increased expenses.\nIn addition to the FDIC’s restoration plan, the FDIC implemented a special assessment to cover the losses incurred by\nthe DIF in response to the 2023 bank failures. Under this additional special assessment, the Bank was assessed 13.4 basis\npoints annually on an assessment base equal to its estimated uninsured deposits, after excluding the first $5 billion of\nuninsured deposits. The special assessment will be collected on a quarterly basis for eight quarters beginning with the first\nquarter of 2024, although the FDIC retained the flexibility to extend the special assessment period and/or impose a one-\ntime shortfall assessment to collect any necessary amounts to fully recover the losses to the DIF.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe FDIC may further increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to restore\nand then steadily increase the DIF to these statutory target levels. Any increase in the Bank's FDIC premiums could have\nan adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. FDIC insurance premiums could increase in\nthe future in response to similar declining economic conditions.\nCredit Risks\nWe may be subject to lending risks and risks associated with loan sector concentrations, which could adversely affect\nthe Company.\nWe take on credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Our credit\nstandards, procedures, and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly considering\nrecent market developments including the recent increases by the Federal Reserve to its benchmark interest rate.\nOur loans held for investment portfolio are concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, we had $11.8 billion of commercial loans, including $8.9 billion of commercial real estate loans,\nrepresenting approximately 64.5% of our loans held for investment portfolio.\nCommercial loans may involve greater risks than our other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often\ndependent on the successful operation or development of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans can be\nmore sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the general economy. Commercial loans typically are made\nbased on borrowers’ ability to make repayment from the cash flow of their commercial venture. If the cash flow from\nbusiness operations is reduced because of adverse conditions, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.\nCommercial loans are, on average, larger loans as compared to other loans with less readily marketable collateral. Given\nthese factors, losses incurred on commercial real estate and commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, many of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly impacted by changes\nin commodity prices, such as agriculture and livestock businesses, as well as businesses indirectly impacted by\ncommodities prices, such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in production of\ncommodities. Changes in commodity products prices depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect\nsupply and demand for the relevant commodity. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real estate market could\nresult in increased delinquencies and foreclosures and could have an adverse effect on the collateral value for many of\nthese loans and on the repayment ability of many of our borrowers. Deterioration in economic conditions or in the real\nestate market could also reduce the number of loans we make to businesses in the construction and real estate industry,\nwhich could negatively impact our interest income and results of operations. Similarly, the occurrence of a natural or man-\nmade disaster in our market areas could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans. Any factor\nor combination of factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations,\nand prospects.\nA decline in economic conditions could reduce demand for our products and services and negatively impact the\ncredit quality of loans, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur clients are located predominantly in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana,\nNebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Unlike larger banks that are more\ngeographically diversified, our profitability largely depends on the general economic conditions in these areas.\nDeterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n• demand for our products and services may decline;\n• loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase;\n• increases in the provisions for credit losses and loans and lease charge-offs;\n• decrease in net interest income derived from lending activities;\n• collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value;\n• future borrowing power of our clients may be reduced;\n• the value of our securities portfolio may decline;\n• the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us; and\n• increases in our operating expenses associated with attending to the effects of the above noted consequences.\n18\nTable of Contents\nVolatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for\nbusinesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may enhance or\ncontribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to\ninflation, could reduce demand for our products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers, or\nresult in lower values for our investment securities and other interest-earning assets. The Federal Reserve stated its current\nobjective is to return the rate of inflation to 2% and it has been aggressively acting to achieve this goal. Throughout 2022\nand 2023, the Federal Reserve has raised the federal funds rate to its current targeted rate between 5.25% and 5.5% in an\neffort to curb inflation. With the general inflationary pressures easing, the Federal Reserve slowed it’s pace of raising\ninterest rates in the second half of 2023. As market interest rates rise, we experience competitive pressures to increase the\nrates we pay on deposits, which may decrease our net interest income. In addition, inflationary pressures will increase our\noperating costs and could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers and the values of collateral securing loans,\nwhich could negatively affect our financial performance. To the extent these monetary policies do not mitigate the\nvolatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, or to the extent conditions otherwise worsen, we\ncould experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDeflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could also have a significant negative effect on our\nborrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could\nnegatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by the economic slowdown in Europe and the\nUnited States, the impact of trade negotiations, escalating tensions with China, economic conditions in China, including the\nglobal economic impacts of the Chinese economy, China’s regulation of commerce, escalating military tensions in Europe\nas a result of Russia’s military action in Ukraine, and the conflict in Israel and the surrounding regions, the outbreak of\nother international or domestic hostilities or other unrest, a default by the United States or other governments in repaying\nfinancial obligations, a shutdown of all or part of the United States government or other governments, the effects of\npandemics or other health crises, acts of terrorism, climate-related events such as prolonged drought, unemployment, or\nother economic and geopolitical factors beyond our control, could further impact these local economic conditions and\nnegatively affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we experience loan credit losses in excess of estimated amounts, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the composition of our\nloan portfolio, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan, and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the\nvalue and marketability of the collateral for the loan. We maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon, among other\nthings, historical experience, delinquency trends, economic conditions, and regular reviews of loan portfolio quality. Based\nupon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan\nportfolio and provides an allowance for credit losses. These assumptions and judgments are complex and difficult to\ndetermine given the significant uncertainty surrounding future conditions in the general economy and banking industry. If\nmanagement’s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for credit losses is inadequate, or if\nbanking authorities or regulations require us to increase the allowance for credit losses, our net income may be adversely\naffected. As a result, an increase in credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and prospects.\nWe invest in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO) securities, which may expose us to losses in connection with\nsuch investments.\nWe invest in certain AAA senior tranches of the capital structure in CLO securities. The senior tranche takes priority\nwith respect to the interest and principal cash flows of the CLO security, while retaining the last priority in a loss scenario.\nThe senior tranches are relatively more liquid than the subordinated notes due to the accompanying credit enhancement.\nThe value of any investment in this asset class could decrease depending on the performance of the underlying collateral in\nthe CLO. As of December 31, 2023, we had available-for-sale CLO securities with an estimated fair value of $1,119.7\nmillion, or 19.2% of our available-for-sale investment portfolio.\nUnited States trade policies and other factors beyond the Company’s control, including the imposition of tariffs and\nretaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUncertainties continue regarding the potential for a renegotiation of international trade agreements by the Biden\nadministration after changes in United States trade policies, legislation, treaties, and tariffs were enacted by the Trump\nadministration. These changes, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, countries\ncomprising the European Union or Middle East, Canada, and Mexico, and retaliatory tariffs by such countries, could\nmaterially harm our business. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs\nare periodically discussed.\n19\nTable of Contents\nA trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies, as well as\nCOVID-19 or other potential epidemics or pandemics, have the potential to negatively impact our and/or our clients’ costs,\ndemand for our clients’ products, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nFinancial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We\nhave exposure to many different industries and counterparties. For example, we execute transactions with counterparties in\nthe financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional\nclients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies or the\nfinancial services industry at times have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or\nby other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to increased credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty\nor client.\nLiquidity Risks\nWe are subject to liquidity risks which could impair our cash flows and adversely affect the Company.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Our liquidity is\nused to make loans and repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by clients. We rely on our ability to\ngenerate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans and investment securities,\nrespectively, to provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable\nsource of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can\nbe adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting\nbusiness industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather,\nnatural disasters, which could be exacerbated by potential climate change, and international instability.\nAdditionally, deposit levels may be affected by several factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate\nlevels, regulatory capital requirements, returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic\nconditions. We may experience potential stresses on liquidity management. We may see deposit levels decrease as clients\nadjust to distressed economic conditions by using the funds that would otherwise be savings. Accordingly, we may be\nrequired from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund\noperations. We maintain a portfolio of investment securities that may be used as a secondary source of liquidity to the\nextent the securities are not pledged as collateral. Other potential sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the\nutilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs, the ability to acquire brokered deposits, the\nissuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as Federal Home Loan Bank advances, the issuance of debt or equity\nsecurities, the sale of available-for-sale securities which may require the sale of securities in a loss position, securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, and borrowings through the Federal Reserve’s discount window.\nWithout sufficient liquidity from these potential sources, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our\ndepositors and borrowers.\nAdditionally, our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable\nto us could be impaired by factors specific to us, the financial services industry, or the economy in general. Factors that\ncould reduce our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in our local or national economies, unfavorable market\nconditions, difficult or illiquid credit markets, impairments on the value of the collateral we use to secure certain of our\nborrowings, or adverse regulatory actions against us. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could have a material, adverse\neffect on our regulatory standing, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLoss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase the Company’s funding costs and negatively affect the\nCompany’s operations.\nDeposits are a low cost and stable source of funding. We depend on checking and savings, negotiable order of\nwithdrawal, money market deposit account balances, and other forms of client deposits as our primary source of funding.\nDeposit levels may be affected by several factors, including interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels,\nreturns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions that affect savings levels and the\namount of liquidity in the economy, including government stimulus efforts in response to economic crises. The availability\nof internet banking products has increased the mobility of client deposits. We compete with banks and other financial\ninstitutions for deposits. Funding costs may increase because the Company may lose deposits and replace them with more\nexpensive sources of funding. Clients may shift their deposits into higher-cost products, or the Company may need to raise\nits interest rates to remain competitive in the marketplace. Higher funding costs reduce the Company’s net interest income\nand net income.\n20\nTable of Contents\nWe experienced modest changes in our total outstanding deposit balances following the bank closures in March and\nMay 2023 and related events. We also experienced changes in deposit balances resulting from typical seasonal fluctuations\ndue to the nature of our business and the business of our customers. We cannot be assured that unusual deposit withdrawal\nactivity will not affect banks generally in the future or the Bank specifically.\nOur Liquidity could be impacted by an inability to access funding, by an unforeseen outflow of cash, or by the\ninability to monetize liquid assets.\nFactors outside of the Company’s control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects\nthird parties, could impair the Company’s ability to access short-term funding or create an unforeseen outflow of cash due\nto, among other factors, draws on unfunded commitments or deposit attrition. Large-scale withdrawals of deposits could\nrequire us to access short-term funding sources to meet immediate cash needs or pay significantly higher interest rates to\nobtain or maintain our deposits, which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income. In\naddition, changes to the underwriting guidelines or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow, and\ntherefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. In the event of future turmoil in the banking industry or\nother events, there is no guarantee that the U.S. government will invoke the systemic risk exception, create additional\nliquidity programs, or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity. The Company’s inability\nto monetize liquid assets or to access short-term funding or capital markets could limit the Company’s ability to make new\nloans or meet existing lending commitments and could impact the Company’s liquidity and capitalization.\nMarket Risks\nChanges in interest rates may have an adverse effect on demand for our products and services and on our\nprofitability.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest\nincome earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-\nbearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the\naverage balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, and the spread between the\nyield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our\nearnings and financial condition. The Federal Reserve increased the federal funds target range by 525 basis points between\nMarch 16, 2022 and July 26, 2023 in an effort to dampen increasing inflation rates. With the general inflationary pressures\neasing, the Federal Reserve slowed its pace of raising interest rates in the second half of 2023. The Federal Reserve also\nindicated in December 2023 that there may be interest rate decreases during 2024, although we cannot control or predict\nwith certainty changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions, competitive pressures, and the policies of\nregulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve and the speed of their implementation, affect\ninterest income and interest expense.\nAs of December 31, 2023, 40.2% of our loans were advanced to our clients on a variable or adjustable-rate basis. The\nprolonged higher borrowing costs resulting from the increases by the Federal Reserve may cause financial hardship on our\nborrowers, reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations. As a result, these increases in interest\nrates could result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures, and charge-offs and could necessitate further increases to the\nallowance for credit losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations. In addition, a decrease in interest rates could negatively impact our margins and profitability and\nuncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future interest rate changes could reduce borrowing demand and, thus, the\nneed for our lending services.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on\nloans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but could also adversely affect (1) our\nability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including mortgage\nservicing rights, (3) our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets, and (4) the average duration of our mortgage-backed\nsecurities and collateralized mortgage obligations portfolios. For example, rising interest rates could adversely affect our\nmortgage banking business because higher interest rates could cause clients to apply for fewer mortgages. Similarly, rising\ninterest rates would increase the required periodic payment for variable rate loans and may result in an increase in non-\nperforming loans. Additionally, rising interest rates may increase the cost of our deposits, which are a primary source of\nfunding. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material, adverse effect on\nour cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates can also affect the slope of the yield curve. The impact from a decline in the current yield\ncurve or a flatter or inverted yield curve could cause our net interest income and net interest margin to contract, which\ncould have a material adverse effect on our net income and cash flows, as well as the value of our assets. An inverted yield\ncurve or downward shift in interest rates may also adversely affect the yield on investment securities by increasing the\nprepayment risk on certain securities. A flattening or inversion of the yield curve or a negative interest rate environment in\nthe United States could create downward pressure on our net interest margin.\n21\nTable of Contents\nChanges in interest rates may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment securities.\nInflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government\nsecurities with interest rates below current market interest rates. Any sale of investment securities that are held in an\nunrealized loss position by us for liquidity or other purposes will cause actual losses to be realized. There can be no\nassurance that there will not be additional bank failures or issues such as liquidity concerns in the broader financial services\nindustry or in the U.S. financial system. Adverse financial market and economic conditions can exert downward pressure\non stock prices, security prices, and credit availability for financial institutions without regard to their underlying financial\nstrength. The volatility and economic disruption resulting from the bank closures in the first two quarters of 2023\nparticularly impacted the price of securities issued by financial institutions, including us.\nOperational Risks\nOur Company faces cybersecurity risks, including “denial-of-service attacks,” “hacking,” and “identity theft” that\ncould result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create\nsignificant legal and financial exposure.\nOur computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks,\nsuch as denial-of-service attacks, hacking, malware, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Financial services institutions and\ncompanies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of\nwhich have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information,\ndestroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses, malware,\nransomware, cyber-attacks, and other means. Denial-of-service attacks have been launched against several large financial\nservices institutions, primarily resulting in inconvenience. Future ransomware and cyber-attacks could be more disruptive\nand damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm to the Company and the\nBank.\nThe hardware and software we purchase from suppliers to facilitate financial services and perform company operations\nare also at risk of having embedded malware, viruses, and other methods intended to develop unauthorized access to\nconfidential information. These types of attacks, known as “supply-chain attacks,” have become more prevalent and are\ncreating additional risks through the solutions and tools upon which we rely. While we have a third-party risk management\nprogram to oversee our vendors and procurement, our ability to successfully mitigate these risks that occur in the hardware\nand software of these vendors is limited. To the extent we experience supply-chain attacks, our business and reputation\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we provide our clients with the ability to bank remotely, including online, through their mobile device, and\nover the telephone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a\ncritical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, malware,\nphishing schemes, and other internal and external security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and\nother resources to protect against threats, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or malicious software. To the\nextent that our activities or the activities of our clients involve the storage and transmission of confidential information,\nsecurity breaches, and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation, and other possible liabilities. Other\npossible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company’s control include internet service providers, electronic\nmail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (cloud) service providers, electronic data security providers,\ntelecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to\nanticipate or prevent all such attacks, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such\nsecurity breaches. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched or\nlater, and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers. These\nrisks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payment and other internet-based product offerings\nand expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. Further, targeted social engineering attacks may be\nsophisticated and difficult to prevent and our employees, clients, or other users of our systems may be fraudulently induced\nto disclose sensitive information, allowing cyber criminals to gain access to our systems or data of our clients.\nIn addition, some of our employees work remotely, including while traveling for business, which increases our\ncybersecurity risk, creates data accessibility concerns, and makes us more susceptible to security breaches or business\ndisruptions.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including\nsignificant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems\nor to those of our clients and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy\nand other laws, financial loss to us or to our clients, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation\nexposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nresults of operations, and prospects.\n22\nTable of Contents\nPrivacy, information security, and data protection laws, rules, and regulations could affect or limit how we collect\nand use personal information, increase our costs, and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security, and data protection laws, including: (i) certain limitations on\nour ability to share non-public personal information about our clients with non-affiliated third parties; (ii) requirements for\ncertain disclosures to clients about our information collection, sharing, and security practices and that afford clients the\nright to “opt out” of any information sharing by us with non-affiliated third parties (with certain exceptions); and (iii)\nrequirements that we develop, implement, and maintain a written information security program containing appropriate\nsafeguards based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of client information\nwe process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Compliance with current or future privacy, data\nprotection, and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting client or\nemployee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain\nproducts and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, or results of\noperations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection, and information security laws could result in potentially\nsignificant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, and damage to our reputation,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMoreover, many U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those promulgated by the SEC, require companies to\nprovide notice of cybersecurity incidents involving certain types of personal data or unauthorized access to, or interference\nwith, our information systems to the public, certain individuals, the media, government authorities, or other third parties.\nCertain of these laws and regulations include notice or disclosure obligations contingent upon the result of complex\nanalyses, including in some cases a determination of materiality. The nature of cybersecurity incidents can make it difficult\nto assess an incident’s overall impact quickly and comprehensively to our business, and we may make errors in our\nassessments. If we are unable to appropriately assess a cybersecurity incident in the context of required analyses then we\ncould face compliance issues under these laws and regulations, and we could be subject to lawsuits, regulatory fines or\ninvestigations, or other liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Furthermore,\ncybersecurity incidents experienced by us, or by our customers or vendors, that lead to public disclosures may also lead to\nwidespread negative publicity and increased government or regulatory scrutiny. Any security compromise in our industry,\nwhether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation; erode customer confidence in our security measures; negatively\naffect our ability to attract new customers; or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or investigations, or other\nliability, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Even the perception of inadequate security\nmay damage our reputation and negatively impact our ability to win new customers and retain existing customers.\nAdditionally, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to investigate and address any\nactual or suspected cybersecurity incident or to prevent further or additional incidents. To maintain business relationships,\nwe may find it necessary or desirable to incur costs to provide remediation and incentives to customers or other business\npartners following an actual or suspected security incident. We also cannot be sure that our existing cybersecurity insurance\nwill continue to be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts to cover any claims we submit, or at all. Further,\nwe cannot be sure that insurers will not deny coverage as to any claim, and some security incidents may be outside the\nscope of our coverage, including in instances where they are considered force majeure events. Security incidents may result\nin increased costs for cybersecurity insurance. One or more large, successful claims against us in excess of our available\ninsurance coverage, or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or large deductible or co-insurance\nrequirements, could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets may become impaired, which may adversely impact our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at\nleast annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates it is likely an impairment has occurred. In\ntesting for impairment, the Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that\nthe fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the\nreporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of our market\nvalue, discounted cash flows, and peer values. Consequently, the determination of the fair value of goodwill is sensitive to\nmarket-based economics and other key assumptions. Variability in market conditions or in key assumptions could result in\nimpairment of goodwill, which is recorded as a non-cash adjustment to income. An impairment of goodwill could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As of December 31, 2023, we had\ngoodwill of $1,100.9 million, or 34.1% of our total stockholders’ equity.\nIdentifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles and other intangible assets\n(primarily customer relationships). Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible\nassets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of customer accounts and/or balances, increased competition or\nadverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment\ncharge would be recorded which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n23\nTable of Contents\nThe Company relies on other companies to provide certain key components of its business infrastructure.\nWe are reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day\noperations and we outsource many of our major systems, such as certain data processing, loan servicing, and deposit\nprocessing systems. Through our contractual relationships, external vendors are subject to some of the same rules and\nregulations that are applicable to the Company and their compliance with regulatory requirements is our responsibility.\nWhile the Company has selected these external vendors and systems carefully and continues to manage and oversee these\nvendors, it does not control their operations. Failure of certain external vendors or systems to perform or provide services\nin accordance with contractual arrangements could be disruptive to our operations and limit our ability to provide certain\nproducts and services demanded by our clients. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems\ninterface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience disruptions if demand for such services exceeds\ncapacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained, or repeated, a system failure\nor disruption could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business,\nand/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability. Any of the failures or disruptions\nmentioned above could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nReplacing these third-party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nOur reputation is very important to our ability to maintain, attract and retain client relationships and if our\nreputation were impaired, it could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOur clients expect us to deliver personalized financial services with the highest standards of performance,\nprofessionalism, compliance, and ethics. Damage to our reputation could undermine retention of our current clients and our\nability to attract potential clients while also impairing the confidence of our counterparties and vendors, the result of which\naffects our ability to effect transactions. Maintaining our reputation depends, in part, on our ability to identify and address\nissues that may arise such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, fair lending issues, client personal\ninformation and privacy issues, cybersecurity, employee, client and other third-party fraud, record-keeping, regulatory\ninvestigations, and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure of us to comply with legal and\nregulatory requirements. To maintain our reputation, we also must prevent third parties from infringing on the “First\nInterstate Bank” brand and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Our reputation or prospects could be\nsignificantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding our Company, whether or not true, that may\nbe posted on social media, reported in the news, or posted in other parts of the internet. Defending our reputation,\ntrademarks, and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe results of mainstream media and social media contagion and speculation could impact the banking system and\nhave an adverse effect on us.\nDissemination of information by mainstream media and social media platforms is extensive and can occur at a rapid\npace. Adverse conditions at financial institutions of significant size can negatively impact other financial institutions,\ndespite the quality of leadership and decision making of the other financial institutions or their ability to effectively\nidentify, measure, manage and control risk. Misinformed or inaccurate reporting regarding an incident or incidents at any\nfinancial institution can impact the broader banking industry, particularly given the speed and breadth of such reporting.\nAny adverse condition could be reported in a way to negatively affect the price of financial institution securities and could\nimpact credit availability for certain issuers without regard to their underlying financial strength. This contagion risk can\nalso occur when a perceived lack of trust in the banking system spreads throughout the industry based upon the results of a\nfew poorly managed larger financial institutions.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our management team and directors and if the services of any of them were to\nbecome unavailable, it could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOur future success and profitability are substantially dependent upon the management skills of senior management and\ndirectors. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees could harm our ability to operate our business or\nexecute our business strategy. The Company faces significant competition in the recruitment of highly motivated\nindividuals who can deliver our Company’s purpose, mission, and values, which has recently intensified as a result of\nchanges in the labor market. The FRB, FDIC, SEC, and other federal regulatory agencies have jointly proposed rules,\nwhich would affect incentive compensation. If finalized, these rules may result in additional costs and restrictions on the\nform of the Company’s incentive compensation. We may not be successful in retaining key employees or finding and\nintegrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees to operate our business effectively, which could have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nThere is substantial competition to attract and retain talented and diverse employees in our markets. It may be difficult\nfor us to attract and retain qualified employees at all management and staffing levels. Failure to attract and retain\nemployees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to\nexecute our business strategy. Furthermore, relatively low unemployment rates may lead to significant increases in labor\ncosts such as salaries, wages, and employee benefits expenses as we compete for qualified and skilled employees, which\ncould negatively impact our results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, in order to continue to hire and retain highly qualified personnel, we will need to continue to manage\nremote working policies, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. From time to time, we\nhave experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate\nqualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater acceptance of\nremote or hybrid work environments, which may increase the competition for talent.\nCosts associated with repossessed properties, including environmental remediation, may adversely impact our results\nof operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may\nforeclose on and take title to properties serving as collateral for certain loans. There are significant costs associated with\nour ownership of these properties including, but not limited to, personnel costs, taxes and insurance, completion and repair\ncosts, and valuation adjustments. Additionally, we may experience unfavorable pricing in connection with our disposition\nof foreclosed properties. These costs, along with unfavorable pricing upon disposition, may adversely affect our cash\nflows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf hazardous or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for\npersonal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially\nreduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more\nstringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental\nliability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a\nmaterial, adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our systems of internal operating and accounting controls were to become ineffective, our financial information\ncould be negatively impacted.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational and accounting controls that provide us with critical\ninformation used to manage our business. These systems are subject to various inherent limitations, including cost,\njudgments used in decision-making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the\npossibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nconditions or processes and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.\nBecause of these limitations, any system of internal operating controls may not be successful in preventing all errors or\nfraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. From time-\nto-time, control deficiencies and losses from operational malfunctions or fraud have occurred and may occur in the future.\nAny future deficiencies, weaknesses, or losses related to internal operating control systems could have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not effectively implement technology-facilitated products and services or be successful in marketing these\nproducts and services to our clients, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new\ntechnology-facilitated products and services. The effective use of technology enables financial institutions to better serve\nclients and perform more efficiently. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to use technology to provide\nproducts and services that will satisfy clients’ demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in our\noperations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may\nnot be able to effectively implement new technology-facilitated products and services or be successful in marketing these\nproducts and services to our clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial\nservices industry could have a material, adverse impact on our business and, in turn, on our financial condition, results of\noperations, and prospects.\n25\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Risks\nWe may encounter difficulties in combining the operations of future acquired entities or assets with our own\noperations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter\ninto strategic contractual relationships may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from these acquisitions,\ninvestments, or relationships.\nAcquisitions of other companies or of financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and\nuncertainties to us based in part on the nature of the business or assets and liabilities acquired. For example, if an\nacquisition includes loan portfolios, the extent of credit losses following completion of the acquisition could adversely\naffect our combined results of operations. Similarly, if an acquisition includes deposits, the extent of deposit attrition after\nclosing could adversely affect our combined results of operations. Acquisitions of banking companies typically include\nboth loans and deposits, and the extent of any post-closing credit losses and deposit attrition could be affected by a number\nof factors, including the state of the economy following the acquisition and the geographic area or markets in which the\ntarget operates. If the markets were to react negatively to the announcement of the acquisition, or if the economy were to\nsuffer or enter into a recession following an acquisition, we may not timely, or at all, achieve the expected benefits of an\nacquisition and our business and the value of our common stock could be harmed.\nAcquisitions of other companies or of financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities also present risks and\nuncertainties to us in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired. These risks include unanticipated\ncosts incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired business. For example, the total cost and time required to\ncomplete the integration successfully could be greater than estimated and result in higher acquisition costs than expected or\na loss of market opportunity due to any such delay. Furthermore, the results of litigation or governmental investigations\nthat may have been pending at the time of an acquisition, or may be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an\nacquisition or otherwise, may be materially underestimated and harm our operating results more than originally anticipated.\nOn the other hand, some or all of the anticipated benefits of a particular acquisition, such as cost savings from synergies or\nstrategic gains from being able to offer product sets to a broader potential client base, may not be realized. It can take\nlonger or require greater resources than originally expected to achieve any of such benefits. It also may prove impossible to\nachieve them at all or in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events. As a result, any acquisition could\nultimately prove dilutive to our equity and shareholders’ earnings per share, thereby adversely affecting our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions may also result in business disruptions that could cause clients to remove their accounts from us and move\ntheir business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could also\nresult in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that\ncould adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients and employees. The loss of key employees in\nconnection with an acquisition could also adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business. Acquisition and\nintegration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial\ncondition and results of operations. Additionally, the operation of the acquired branches may adversely affect our existing\nprofitability, and we may not be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the existing banking\nbusiness or manage growth resulting from the acquisition effectively, any of which could harm our business and reputation.\nIn addition to post-acquisition integration related risks, inherent uncertainties exist when assessing or integrating the\noperations of another business into which we may make an investment or with which we may enter a commercial\nrelationship. We may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies relevant to an\ninvestment or strategic relationship. In addition, the markets and industries in which we and the potential investment targets\noperate are highly competitive. Investment targets and commercial contract counterparties may lose clients or otherwise\nperform poorly or unprofitably, or in the case of a strategic relationship, cause us to lose clients or perform poorly or\nunprofitably. Future investment activities and efforts to monitor or reap the benefits of a new strategic relationship may\nrequire us to devote substantial time and resources and may cause these investments and relationships to be unprofitable or\ncause us to be unable to pursue other business opportunities, any of which could harm our business.\nThe Company may experience significant competition from new or existing competitors, which may reduce its client\nbase or cause it to adjust prices for its products and services in order to maintain market share.\nThere is intense competition among banks in the Company’s market areas. In addition, the Company competes with\nother providers of financial services, such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies,\nsecurities firms, insurance companies, commercial finance and leasing companies, factoring companies, the mutual funds\nindustry, financial technology (“fintech”) companies, full-service brokerage firms, and discount brokerage firms, some of\nwhich are subject to less extensive regulations than us with respect to the products and services they provide. Our success\ndepends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and client expectations.\nThere is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest\nmargin and revenues from our fee-based products and services.\n26\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the adoption of new technologies by competitors, including internet banking services, mobile applications,\nand advanced ATM functionality, could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing\nproducts and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in\nearnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. The Company may not be successful in introducing new products and\nservices, achieving market acceptance of its products and services, anticipating or reacting to consumers’ changing\ntechnological preferences, or developing and maintaining loyal clients. In addition, we could lose market share to the\nshadow banking system or other non-traditional banking organizations. Some of our larger competitors may have greater\ncapital and resources than the Company, higher lending limits, and products and services not offered by us. Any potential\nadverse reactions to our financial condition or status in the marketplace, as compared to its competitors, could limit our\nability to attract and retain clients and to compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain clients\nor to effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Company also experiences competition from non-bank companies inside and outside of its market area and, in\nsome cases, from companies other than those traditionally considered financial sector participants. In particular, technology\ncompanies have begun to focus on the financial sector and offer software and products primarily over the internet, with an\nincreasing focus on mobile device delivery. These companies generally are not subject to regulatory requirements\ncomparable to those to which financial institutions are subject and may accordingly realize certain cost savings and offer\nproducts and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the client. For example, a number of\ncompanies offer bill pay and funds transfer services that allow clients to avoid using a bank. Technology companies are\ngenerally positioned and structured to quickly adapt to technological advances and directly focus resources on\nimplementing those advances. This competition could result in the loss of fee income and client deposits and related\nincome. In addition, changes in consumer spending and saving habits could adversely affect our operations, and the\nCompany may be unable to develop competitive and timely new products and services in response. As technology\ncontinues to advance, continuous innovation is expected to exert long-term pressure on the financial services industry.\nInvesting in technology, and the inability or failure to integrate technologies into the Company’s operations may\naffect our business and earnings negatively.\nOur success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human\nresources in innovation and technology, particularly in light of the current “FinTech” environment, in which financial\ninstitutions are investing significantly in new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning,\nblockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, and developing potentially industry-changing new products, services\nand industry standards in order to attract clients. Our investment is directed at meeting the needs of our clients, adapting\nexisting products and services to consider the evolving demands of the marketplace, and maintaining the security of our\nsystems and building a platform for future innovation, technology, and a competitive advantage that is scalable. Our\ninvestment focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services, such as our recent implementation of\nEncompass Mortgage Loan Origination System, Mortgage Online Banking and Mobile Application, Commercial Center\nOnline Banking, Healthcare Receivables Manager, Contactless Credit and Debit Cards and Zelle. Falling significantly\nbehind our competition in technology, or if the Company is not able to properly or timely anticipate or implement such\ntechnologies, or effectively train its staff to use such technologies, its business, financial condition, or operating results\ncould be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the recent emerging technology trends, such as AI, including large language models, require us to keep pace\nwith evolving regulations and industry standards. In the United States, there are various current and proposed regulatory\nframeworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating\nto emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create\ncompliance risks and potential liability, all which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results\nof operations. Governments are also considering the new issues in intellectual property law that AI creates, which could\nresult in different intellectual property rights in technology we create with AI and development processes and procedures\nand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may incur significant costs related to future acquisitions by merger and subsequent integration activities.\nWe have incurred and expect to incur certain non-recurring costs associated with mergers. These costs include financial\nadvisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, severance/employee benefit-related costs, public company\nfiling fees and other regulatory fees, printing costs, and other related costs.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe may incur substantial costs in connection with the integration of acquired companies. There are many processes,\npolicies, procedures, operations, technologies, and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing,\naccounting and finance, payroll, compliance, treasury management, branch operations, vendor management, risk\nmanagement, lines of business, pricing, and benefits. While we have assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred,\nthere are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs.\nMoreover, many of the costs that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration\ncosts may result in us taking charges against earnings, the amount and timing of which are uncertain at present.\nCommon Stock Risks\nVolatility in the price and volume of our common stock may be unfavorable.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n• general economic conditions;\n• prevailing market conditions;\n• our historical performance and capital structure;\n• estimates of our business potential and earnings prospects;\n• an overall assessment of our management;\n• our performance relative to our peers;\n• market demand for our shares;\n• impact of potential large sales by investors with significant holdings, including members of the Scott Family\nshareholder group;\n• perceptions of the banking industry in general;\n• political influences on investor sentiment;\n• consumer confidence;\n• consummation of a strategic acquisition or other implementation of our expansion plans;\n• international or domestic hostilities, or other international or domestic calamities, including wars or international\nconflicts with respect to which the United States may or may not be directly involved; and\n• global conditions, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods, fires, pandemics, and other natural catastrophic events.\nAt times, the stock markets, including the NASDAQ Stock Market on which our common stock is listed, may\nexperience significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to be\nsimilarly volatile and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including\ndecreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.\nIn addition, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities,\nsecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could\nresult in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\n“Anti-takeover” provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may also make it more difficult for a third\nparty to acquire control of us, even if the change in control could be deemed beneficial to stockholders.\nWe are a financial and bank holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware. Anti-takeover provisions in\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under\nfederal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent stockholders from\nreceiving a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market price of our\ncommon stock and could reduce the amount stockholders might receive if we are sold.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that our Board may issue up to 100,000 shares of preferred stock, in one or\nmore series, without stockholder approval and with such terms, conditions, rights, privileges, and preferences as the Board\nmay deem appropriate. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for our Board and\nlimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders and advance notice requirements for stockholder\nproposals at stockholder meetings. In addition, while we have opted out of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of\nthe State of Delaware, in order to effect a change of control transaction as such term is used in our certificate of\nincorporation, our certificate of incorporation requires approval of stockholders holding the greater of (A) a majority of the\nvoting power of the issued and outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a\nsingle class, and (B) sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66.67%) of the voting power of the shares of our capital stock\npresent in person or represented by proxy at the stockholder meeting called to consider such transaction and entitled to vote\nthereon. These and other provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or\nof impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with\nthe opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such common stock.\n28\nTable of Contents\nFurther, the acquisition of specified amounts of our common stock (in some cases, the acquisition or control of more\nthan 5% of our voting stock) may require certain regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Federal Reserve and\none or more of our state banking regulatory agencies. The filing of applications with these agencies and the accompanying\nreview process can take several months. This and the other factors described above may hinder or even prevent a change in\ncontrol of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur dividend policy, or our ability to pay dividends, may change.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiary Bank. Since we are a holding company with no\nsignificant assets other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries, we depend upon dividends from our Bank for a substantial\npart of our revenue. Accordingly, our ability to pay dividends, cover operating expenses, and acquire other institutions\ndepends primarily upon the receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The ability of our Bank to pay\ndividends to us is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition, and need for funds, as well as federal and\nstate governmental policies and regulations applicable to us and the Bank, which limit the amount that may be paid as\ndividends without prior approval.\nAlthough we have historically paid dividends to our stockholders, we have no obligation to continue doing so and may\nchange our dividend policy at any time without notice to our stockholders. Holders of our common stock are only entitled\nto receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. The\namount of any dividend declaration is subject to our evaluation of our strategic plans, growth initiatives, capital\navailability, projected liquidity needs, and other factors.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank savings account or deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any\nother deposit insurance fund, or any other public or private entity. As a result, holders of our common stock could lose\nsome or all of their investment.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock in the future pursuant to current or future employee equity\ncompensation plans or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. Should we choose to raise capital by selling\nshares of common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and\ncould have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of our common\nstock rank junior to all our indebtedness, including any subordinated term loans, subordinated debentures held by trusts that\nhave issued trust-preferred securities, and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims on\nus. In the future, we may make additional offerings of debt or equity securities, or we may issue additional debt or equity\nsecurities as consideration for future mergers and acquisitions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe recently identified combined deficiencies resulting in a material weakness in our internal control over financial\nreporting, which, if we are unable to remediate appropriately or timely, could result in a loss of investor confidence and\nadversely impact our stock price, and could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results and\nharm our business.\nAs an SEC reporting company, we are required to, among other things, maintain a system of effective internal control\nover financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II - Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, management has identified\ndeficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, which, when considered together in their entirety, have resulted\nin a material weakness. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not\neffective as of December 31, 2023.\nRemediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources\nand processes. As a result, we may not be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material\nweakness identified by management, or do so in a timely manner, or identify and remediate additional control deficiencies,\nincluding material weaknesses, in the future.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to remediate these combined deficiencies resulting in a material weakness, or are otherwise unable to\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting: our ability to record, process and report financial information\naccurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected; our liquidity, our\naccess to capital markets, the perceptions of our creditworthiness, and our ability to complete acquisitions may be\nadversely affected; and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable securities laws and the Nasdaq Stock\nMarket LLC listing requirements, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources\nand payment of legal and other expenses which may negatively impact results of operations and financial condition, could\nnegatively affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, and could adversely\nimpact our stock price.\nOur business is subject to the risks of certain global conditions, earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, tornados, floods,\nfires, drought, and other natural catastrophic events.\nA major catastrophe, such as a pandemic, disease outbreak, or other natural disaster including extreme weather or other\nevents, such as an earthquake, tornados, tsunami, flood, fire, drought, winter storms, or other type of natural disaster, could\nadversely affect our financial condition or results in a prolonged interruption of our business. We have operations and\nclients in the West and Midwest, a geographical region that has been or may be affected by disease, earthquake, volcano,\ntsunami, tornados, fires, drought, and flooding activity, which could be adversely impacted by these natural disasters or\nother severe weather in the region. Unpredictable natural and other disasters could have an adverse effect on the Company\nin that such events could materially disrupt our operations or the ability or willingness of our clients to access the financial\nservices offered by the Company. These events could reduce our earnings and cause volatility in its financial results for any\nfiscal quarter or year and have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and/or results of operations and\nprospects.\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses and\ncustomers.\nThere is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The\nphysical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate\npatterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Such events could disrupt our\noperations or those of our clients or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect\nimpacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low carbon economy may entail\nextensive policy, legal, technology, and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences and\nadditional regulatory requirements or taxes, could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies. In addition, our\nreputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our\ninvolvement, or our clients’ involvement, in certain industries or projects associated with causing or exacerbating climate\nchange, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations\nrelating to climate change. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to\nenhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies such as market, credit and\noperational risks; however, because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable, our risk management\nstrategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure.\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone.\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\nThe Company provides cybersecurity services to the Bank. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic\ncommunications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. Cybersecurity risk\nmanagement is overseen both as a critical component of our overall risk management program and as a standalone\nprogram. As further described below, we have implemented a risk-based, cross-functional approach to identifying,\npreventing and mitigating cybersecurity threats and incidents, while also implementing controls and procedures that\nprovide for the prompt escalation of certain cybersecurity incidents so that decisions regarding the public disclosure and\nreporting of such incidents can be made by management in a timely manner. We also offset cyber risk through internal\ntraining and testing of our employees, among other processes, in accordance with our policies and procedures.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have developed policies and procedures to provide processes and guidelines for managing cybersecurity incidents\nwith the goal of minimizing disruption, damage, protecting data, and helping recover from a cybersecurity incident as\nquickly as possible.\n30\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, in furtherance of our fiduciary responsibility to protect and account for information and information\nsystems that are recognized as critical bank assets, we have established policies that require, among other things, that we\nperform an information security risk and vulnerability assessment at least annually, and implement corresponding risk\nmanagement controls; implement a defense-in-depth security architecture, which may include firewalled network\nsegmentation, malicious software protection, and data loss prevention; leverage data loss prevention technology to assist in\npreventing unauthorized disclosure of non-public information; and engage independent third parties to review, audit, and\ntest the information security control structure and program to ensure processes and controls are functioning properly.\nAs part of our overall cybersecurity risk management process, employees receive annual training on incident\npreparedness, response, and recovery which we believe to be commensurate with their responsibilities. Employees are\ngiven directions on where to report actual or suspected incidents, both with respect to cybersecurity incidents as well as\nother risks, such as office closures, robbery, physical security, and employee or client injury. In addition to employees,\nindividuals with a leadership role in the cybersecurity incident response processes are trained on their responsibilities\nannually, and the processes and those responsible for implementing them will be tested at least annually to assist in\nimproving performance of the incident handlers and to identify issues with policies, procedures, and communication\nprocess.\nTo manage the information security processes related to relationships with third parties and contractors, we maintain a\npolicy which requires all third parties and contractors to implement controls and abide by a non-disclosure agreement, and\nwe regularly evaluate existing critical third-party service providers to ensure they continue to meet our minimum\ninformation security practices. Proposed relationships with new third-party service providers are evaluated to ensure the\ntechnology provided is in alignment with our standards and guidelines.\nWe have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss, or any material financial losses related to\ncybersecurity attacks, and no risks from cybersecurity threats that are known to us are believed to be reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. Risks and exposures\nrelated to cybersecurity attacks, however, are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, due to the rapidly\nevolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of third-party service providers,\ninternet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services.\nGovernance\nWhile all employees, including members of our information technology (“IT”) team, are required to report any known\nor suspected security event, pursuant to our policies and procedures, the following members of Company management and\nthe Board of Directors are tasked specifically with the responsibilities described below:\n• Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (“CIRT”) – The CIRT was established to provide quick, effective, and orderly\nresponses to serious successful cybersecurity related incidents such as system and application outages, virus infections,\nhacker attempts, system compromises, improper disclosure of confidential information, system service interruptions,\nbreach of personal identifiable information, or other technology related events with serious security implications or\nbusiness disruptions.\nThe CIRT consists of various IT groups with the knowledge and expertise needed to execute the technical aspect of the\nCompany’s cybersecurity policies and procedures, including our Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) and Chief\nInformation Security Officer (“CISO”). As further described below, these officers are responsible for facilitating\ncommunications with the Risk Committee.\nWhen an incident is reported, the CIRT determines the scope, scale and severity of the event and determines if the\nevent is an incident. When the CIRT has determined an incident has occurred, the team is responsible for responding to\nsuch incident in a timely, cost-effective manner and reporting findings as necessary and appropriate, including\ncommunicating to other key stakeholders for the duration of such incident. In general, the CIRT reports such findings\nto the CISO, the CISO reports the information to the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”), and the CRO ultimately reports\nthose findings to the Risk Committee.\n• Risk Committee – The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our enterprise-wide risk\nmanagement program and corporate risk function, including cyber risk. The Risk Committee assesses whether the risk-\nmanagement programs are capable of managing our significant risks and monitors whether our most significant\nenterprise-wide risk exposures are in alignment with our appetite for risk.\n• Enterprise Risk Management Committee (“ERMC”) – The ERMC is a management committee of the Bank. The Risk\nCommittee delegates oversight responsibility of the Company’s cybersecurity programs to the ERMC. The ERMC\npresents summary reporting to the Risk Committee pertaining to the status of such programs.\n31\nTable of Contents\n• Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”) – Karlyn M. Knieriem has served as our Executive Vice President and CRO since 2022.\nAs CRO, Ms. Knieriem is responsible for reporting serious incidents to external authorities pursuant to advice from\ninternal or external legal counsel, unless otherwise delegated. Ms. Knieriem has over 25 years of experience in\nfinancial services across a variety of roles including finance, treasury, retail, credit, and risk management.\n• Chief Information Officer (“CIO”) – Lori Meyer has served as our CIO since June 30, 2023, after serving in several\nleadership roles in the Company, including Director of Enterprise Program Management, Director of IT Business\nManagement, Director of IT Business Relations, and Business Process Improvement Lead. As CIO, Ms. Meyer is\nresponsible for oversight of the Company’s cybersecurity policies and informing the ERMC on current computer\nsecurity readiness, information security standards, procedures, regulatory compliance, data security and privacy\nconcerns, and the remediation plans annually, or as needed.\n• Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) – Dale Daugherty has served as our CISO since 2021. As CISO, Mr.\nDaugherty is responsible for establishing and monitoring the effectiveness of the Company’s cybersecurity policies\nand reporting the status and a summary of cybersecurity incidents to the CRO, CIO, ERMC, and Risk Committee. In\nthis role, Mr. Daugherty serves as an intermediary between the CRO and the CIRT. Since 2002, Mr. Daugherty has\nserved in the roles of Information Security Officer, AVP – IT Audit Manager, and Director of IT Compliance, Risk,\nand Security for the Bank and holds the CISSP, CISA, GCIH, GCIA, and GSEC certifications.\n• Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”) – Rachel B. Turitto has served as our CHRO since 2019. As CHRO, Ms.\nTuritto is responsible for appropriate administration of the Company’s cybersecurity policies with respect to\nemployee-related cybersecurity incidents. Ms. Turitto joined us with over 15 years of diverse experience across\nmultiple human resource disciplines, including human resource information systems.\nThe Company believes its risk management strategy and governance programs related to cybersecurity matters are\nappropriate for a growing banking system of its size, but we continue to monitor them and improve upon them as warranted\nunder our programs, policies, and procedures. Finally, we maintain customary cybersecurity insurance that we believe is\nappropriate for our industry and comparable to our peers.\nItem 2. Properties\nOur principal executive offices and one of our banking offices are anchor tenants in an 18-story commercial building\nlocated in Billings, Montana. The building is owned by a joint venture limited liability company in which FIB owns a\n50.0% interest. We lease approximately 100,107 square feet of office space in the building. We also own a 66,112 square\nfoot building that houses our operations center in Billings, Montana. As of December 31, 2023, we provided banking\nservices at 304 locations in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North\nDakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming, of which 74 properties are leased from independent third\nparties, one property was leased from a related entity, and 229 physical properties are owned by us. We believe each of our\nfacilities is suitable and adequate to meet our current operational needs.\nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\nIn the normal course of business, we may be named or threatened to be named as a defendant in various lawsuits. We\nrecord accruals for outstanding legal matters when it is believed to be probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. Management, following consultation with legal counsel, does not expect the ultimate\ndisposition of any or a combination of any such ongoing or anticipated matters to have a material, adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, or operating results.\nItem 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II\nItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “FIBK.” As of December 31,\n2023, we had 1,761 record shareholders, including the Wealth Management division of FIB as trustee for 306,734 shares of\ncommon stock held on behalf of 447 individual participants in the Savings and Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of First\nInterstate BancSystem, Inc., or the Savings Plan.\n32\nTable of Contents\nDividends\nIt is our policy to pay a quarterly dividend to all common shareholders. On January 26, 2024, the Company declared a\nquarterly cash dividend amount of $0.47 per share of common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nrelated notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We make\nstatements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All of such\nforward-looking statements are expressly qualified by reference to the cautionary statements provided under the caption\n“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included on page 1 in Part I of this report. Furthermore, a\nnumber of known and unknown factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially\nfrom those expressed or implied by the following discussion. Therefore, you are encouraged to read in its entirety the\ninformation provided under the caption “Risk Factors” included under Item 1A in Part I of this report for a discussion of\nrisk factors that may negatively impact our expected results, performance, or achievements discussed below.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, this document contains GAAP financial measures\nand non-GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations\nor financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as\nthe reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.\nFully-Taxable Equivalent Basis. Interest income, yields, and ratios on an FTE basis are considered non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Management believes net interest income on an FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin\nfor comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent. We encourage readers to\nconsider the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information contained in this Form 10-K in their\nentirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nExecutive Overview\nWe are a financial and bank holding company headquartered in Billings, Montana. As of December 31, 2023, we had\nconsolidated assets of $30.7 billion, deposits of $23.3 billion, loans held for investment of $18.3 billion, and total\nstockholders’ equity of $3.2 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had 304 banking offices in operation, including branches and detached drive-up\nfacilities, in communities across Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North\nDakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. Through our bank subsidiary, FIB, we deliver a\ncomprehensive range of banking products and services—including online and mobile banking—to individuals, businesses,\ngovernmental entities, and others throughout our market areas. Our clients participate in a wide variety of industries,\nincluding:\n• Agriculture • Healthcare • Professional services • Technology\n• Construction • Hospitality • Real Estate Development • Tourism\n• Education • Housing • Retail • Wholesale trade\n• Governmental services\nOur Business\nOur principal business activity is lending to, accepting deposits from, and conducting financial transactions for\nindividuals, businesses, governmental entities, and other entities located in the communities we serve. We derive our\nincome principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on fixed\nincome investments. We also derive income from non-interest sources such as: (i) fees received in connection with various\nlending and deposit services; (ii) wealth management services, such as trust, employee benefit, investment, and insurance\nservices; (iii) mortgage loan originations, sales, and servicing; (iv) merchant and electronic banking services; and (v) from\ntime-to-time, gains on sales of assets and securities.\nOur principal expenses include: (i) interest expense on deposit accounts and other borrowings; (ii) salaries and\nemployee benefits; (iii) furniture, equipment, and occupancy expenses for maintaining our facilities; (iv) data processing\nand communication costs primarily associated with maintaining loan and deposit functions; (v) professional fees, including\nFDIC insurance assessments; (vi) income tax expense; (vii) provisions for credit losses; (viii) intangible amortization; (ix)\nother real estate owned expenses; and (x) other ancillary expenses including legal expenses, credit card rewards expense,\nfees associated with originating and closing loans, insurance, and other expenses necessary to support our employees and\nservice our clients. From time to time, we also incur acquisition costs related to our strategic acquisitions.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural, and other loans, including fixed\nand variable rate loans. Our real estate loans comprise commercial real estate, construction (including residential,\ncommercial, and land development construction loans), residential, agricultural, and other real estate loans. Fluctuations in\nthe loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan we originate must\nmeet minimum underwriting standards we establish through our credit policies, our bankers are granted limited discretion\nto approve and price loans within pre-approved limits which assures that we are responsive to community needs in each\nmarket area and remain competitive. We fund our loan portfolio primarily with the core deposits from our clients and cash\nflows off of the investment portfolio. We generally do not rely on brokered deposits to fund our loans and rely to a limited\nextent on wholesale funding sources. For additional information about our underwriting standards and loan approval\nprocess, see “Business—Lending Activities,” included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nRecent Trends and Developments\nAcquisitions\nDuring the past few years, we have increased our community banking footprint across the Rocky Mountain and Pacific\nNorthwest regions and have expanded into the Midwest and Southwest regions, in large part due to our acquisition activity.\nAs part of our overall growth strategy, we will continue to evaluate bank acquisitions and other opportunities in a strategic\nthoughtful manner that we believe will enhance our franchise and provide greater shareholder value.\nDuring 2022, we acquired Great Western Bancorp, Inc., the parent company of GWB, a Sioux Falls, South Dakota\nbased community bank, for total consideration of $1,723.3 million, consisting of the issuance of 46.9 million shares of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock valued at $36.76 per share. The merger was completed on February 1, 2022 and the\ncore systems were converted in May 2022, at which point GWB’s operations were integrated with the Company’s\noperations. The acquisition of GWB’s 174 banking offices across Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri,\nNebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota expanded the Company’s geographical footprint. The accompanying\nconsolidated statements of income for the period ended December 31, 2023, include the results of operations of the\nacquired entity from the February 1, 2022 acquisition date.\nCommon Stock\nOn March 25, 2022, all outstanding shares of the Company’s Class B common stock automatically converted into\nshares of the Company’s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, pursuant to the terms of the Company’s Third\nAmended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the “Charter”). No additional shares of Class B common\nstock are permitted to be issued. On May 24, 2023, the Company’s shareholders approved a conversion of the Company’s\nstate of incorporation from Montana to Delaware. At the effective time of the conversion, each outstanding share of the\nCompany’s Class A common stock became an outstanding share of common stock of the Company and each outstanding\noption, warrant or other right to acquire shares of the Company’s previously designated Class A common stock became an\noutstanding option, warrant or other right to acquire shares of common stock of the Company. The former holders of Class\nA and Class B common stock now hold common stock with the same voting powers, preferences, rights and qualifications,\nlimitations and restrictions as the other holders of common stock. All shares of the Company’s outstanding capital stock are\nnow composed solely of shares of common stock and are entitled to one vote per share. The Company’s common stock\ncontinues to trade on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the ticker symbol “FIBK.”\nEconomic Conditions\nDuring the first half of 2023, the banking industry experienced significant volatility with multiple high-profile bank\nfailures leading to broader industry concerns related to funding and liquidity. Despite these developments, the Company’s\nliquidity position and balance sheet remains strong, and the capital ratios continue to exceed all regulatory well-capitalized\nrequirements as of December 31, 2023. Our deposit base is diversified, including by depositor, which includes individuals,\nbusinesses across multiple industries, municipalities, and other entities, as well as geographically, across our 14-state\nfootprint. As of December 31, 2023, our FDIC insured deposits were 65.6% of total deposits, including accounts eligible\nfor pass-through insurance.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2022, the Bank began borrowing from the FHLB to fund loan growth and provide\nexcess liquidity for deposit outflows. Total deposits decreased $1.8 billion at December 31, 2023 compared to\nDecember 31, 2022. As a result of the declines in deposits, and limited re-investment of portfolio cash flows, at\nDecember 31, 2023, other borrowed funds which are comprised of FHLB advances increased $0.3 billion to $2.6 billion at\nDecember 31, 2023, from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022 at an average rate of 5.32% and 3.72%, respectively.\nAs of February 23, 2024, the Bank had available borrowing capacity of $3.8 billion with the FHLB and $2.0 billion\nwith the Federal Reserve Bank based on pledged investment securities and loan collateral.\n36\nTable of Contents\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) offered a new Bank Term Funding Program\n(“BTFP”) for eligible depository institutions. The BTFP offers loans of up to one-year to institutions pledging collateral\neligible for purchase by the FRB in open market operations such as U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Agency securities, and U.S.\nagency mortgage-backed securities. These assets will be valued at par for pledging purposes. In January 2024, the\nCompany accessed borrowings through the BTFP which enabled the Company to pay off higher rate FHLB advances and\nsupport its current cash position.\nU.S. inflation, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has been volatile with data showing a multi-decade high in\nJune 2022, climbing to 9.1%, going as low as 3.0% in June 2023, and finishing at 3.4% in December 2023. While our\noperating expenses are affected by general inflation, the asset and liability structure of the Company largely consists of\nmonetary items. Monetary items, such as cash, investments, loans, deposits and other borrowings, are assets and liabilities\nwhich are or will be converted into a fixed number of dollars regardless of changes in prices. As a result, changes in\ninterest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution’s performance than does general inflation. However,\ninflation may have negative impacts on the Company’s clients and their customers, impacting their ability or willingness to\nrepay loans or maintain deposits.\nThe Federal Reserve stated its current objective is to return the rate of inflation to 2% and it has been aggressively\nacting to achieve this goal. In response to sustained inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve increased short-term interest\nrates 525 basis points between March 16, 2022 and July 26, 2023. With the general inflationary pressures easing, the\nFederal Reserve slowed it’s pace of raising interest rates in the second half of 2023. The recent interest rate increases have\nresulted in increased returns on our interest earning assets. The Company’s yield on interest earning assets increased to\n4.57% as of December 31, 2023 from 3.63% as of December 31, 2022, and 2.96% as of December 31, 2021.\nHowever, as the short end (up to two years) of the yield curve on the U.S. Treasuries has increased, interest rates have\nhad a more significant impact on the Company’s cost of funds, primarily as a result of the shift of non-interest-bearing\ndeposits into higher-cost interest-bearing and time deposit balances and higher levels of variable rate debt. The Company’s\ncost of funds increased to 1.46% at December 31, 2023, from 0.29% at December 31, 2022, and 0.10% at December 31,\n2021. Overall, the change in the mix and cost of funds has offset the changes in the mix and yield on earning assets,\nresulting in compression of the Company’s FTE net interest margin, a non-GAAP measure, to 3.14% at December 31,\n2023, from 3.36% at December 31, 2022, and expansion from 2.85% at December 31, 2021, as a result of higher levels and\nyields on earning assets more than offsetting higher levels and costs of interest bearing liabilities.\nWhile gross domestic product has expanded at or above 2.0% since the second quarter of 2022, it is unclear whether the\nvolatility of 2022 and 2023 in the economic performance of the U.S. economy will lead to an economic slowdown,\ndownturn, or recession or whether its regular pattern of growth will continue. Any economic slowdown, downturn, or\nrecession could impact the Company and one of its primary funding sources, by impacting the level of deposits held by our\nclients, whether through a higher volume of withdrawals or through a lower volume of inflows to deposits. The credit\nquality of the Company’s loans may also be impacted if clients must weather adverse economic conditions which could\nresult in an increase in credit losses or other related expenses.\nPrimary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business\nAs a banking institution, we manage and evaluate our financial condition and our results of operations. We monitor and\nevaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as various\nfinancial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own\nhistorical levels as well as and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region\nand nationally.\nResults of Operations\nPrincipal tools we use to manage and evaluate the results of our operations include tracking performance through\nmetrics such as return on average equity, return on average assets, efficiency ratio, non-interest expense as a percent of\ntotal average assets, earnings per share, total shareholder return, net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest\nexpense, and net income.\nNet interest income is affected by a number of factors such as the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the\nspeed of changes in interest rates, and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest-\nbearing liabilities. Changes in interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest\npaid on liabilities, has the most significant impact on net interest income. Other factors like volume of loans, investment\nsecurities, and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings,\nand other indebtedness, also cause changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest bearing sources of\nfunds, such as demand deposits and stockholders’ equity, help support earning assets.\n37\nTable of Contents\nThe impact of funding, including non-interest-bearing deposit sources, is captured in the net interest margin, which is\ncalculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. We evaluate our net interest income by assessing the\nyields on our loans and other earning assets, the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, and the levels of our net\ninterest spread and net interest margin.\nWe seek to increase our non-interest income over time, and we evaluate our non-interest income relative to the trends\nof the individual types of non-interest income in view of changes in the regulatory environment and prevailing market\nconditions. We manage our non-interest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking\nmodel that emphasizes client service and responsiveness. We evaluate our non-interest expense on factors that include our\nnon-interest expense relative to our average assets, our efficiency ratio, and the trends of the individual categories of non-\ninterest expense.\nFinally, we seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time, and we evaluate our\nnet income relative to the performance of similar bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets,\nreturn on average equity, total shareholder return, and growth in earnings.\nFinancial Condition\nWe manage and evaluate our financial condition by focusing on liquidity, the diversification and quality of our loans,\nthe adequacy of our allowance for credit losses, the diversification and terms of our deposits, short-term borrowings and\nother funding sources, the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities, including potential interest\nrate exposure, and the adequacy of our capital levels. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment\nsecurities to meet potential payment and funding obligations, and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the\nlevels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities, the quality and maturities of our investment securities, the\nratio of loans held for investment to deposits, and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale\nfunding sources.\nWe seek to maintain a diverse and high-quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the\nallocation of our loans among loan types, credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type, non-performing assets as\na percentage of loans held for investment and OREO, and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. We maintain\nour allowance for credit losses based on an estimate of expected credit losses in the loans held for investment portfolio over\nthe life of the loan, including the incorporation of a two-year forecast period at each balance sheet date, and we evaluate the\nlevel of our allowance for credit losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non-performing loans and\npotential charge-offs.\nWe seek to fund our assets primarily using core client deposits spread among various deposit categories, and we\nevaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types, the level of\nour non-interest-bearing deposits, the ratio of our core deposits (i.e. excluding time deposits above $250,000) to our total\ndeposits, and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources, such as borrowings from other banks or\nagencies. We seek to manage the mix, maturities, and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to mitigate the\nimpact of a changing interest rate environment on our net interest margin, and we evaluate our asset-liability management\nusing models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios.\nFinally, we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the\ngrowth of our balance sheet. We evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including\ntangible common equity to tangible assets, leverage capital ratio, tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets, tier 1\nrisk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles\n(“GAAP”) in the United States and follow practices prescribed within the banking industry. Application of these principles\nrequires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated\nfinancial statements and accompanying notes. The most significant accounting policies we follow are summarized in\n“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part IV, Item 15\nof this report.\nOur critical accounting estimates are summarized below. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical\nif: (1) the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective, and/or complex judgments\nabout matters that are inherently uncertain, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period\nto period, or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, or liquidity.\n38\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that creates an allowance for credit losses expected over the life\nof loans at each balance sheet date, which is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount\nexpected to be collected on the loans. Increases in the allowance are recorded through net income as a provision for credit\nloss expense. Decreases in the allowance are recorded through net income as a reversal of provision for credit loss expense.\nLoans are charged-off against the allowance when management confirms the uncollectibility of a loan balance. Expected\nrecoveries recorded in the valuation account do not exceed the aggregate of loan amounts previously charged-off. The\nallowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses in the loans held for investment\nportfolio over the life of the loan, including the incorporation of a two-year forecast period with one-year reversion period\nfor economic conditions.\nWe perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each\nsignificant loan we have assessed to have weaknesses that does not share common risk characteristics with other loans.\nBased on this analysis, we record a provision for credit losses in order to maintain the allowance for credit losses at\nappropriate levels. In determining the allowance for credit losses, management estimates the allowance balance using\nrelevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts.\nHistorical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to\nhistorical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in\nunderwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency level, or term as well as for changes in environmental and economic\nconditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors. The allowance for credit\nlosses is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist.\nFor loans acquired in a business combination with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination, the\nCompany estimates an allowance for credit losses of the loans determined using the same methodology as other loans held\nfor investment.\nThe allowance for credit losses is maintained at an amount we believe to be sufficient to provide for estimated losses\nexpected over the life of the loans at each balance sheet date resulting from management’s assessment of the quantitative\nand qualitative factors utilized to determine the allowance for credit losses. Management monitors trends in the loan\nportfolio, including changes in the levels of past due, internally classified, and non-performing loans. Changes in the\nestimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and as a result, on our\nconsolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nSee “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of\nthe methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and our policy pertaining to acquired loans. See “Notes\nto Consolidated Financial Statements—Loans” for a discussion on the factors driving changes in the amount of the\nallowance for credit losses. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Credit Risks.”\nGoodwill\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at\nleast annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates it is likely impairment has occurred. Goodwill\nimpairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. In any given year, the\nCompany may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of\na reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in\nexcess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is\nperformed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of\nthe Company’s market value, discounted cash flows, and peer values. The determination of goodwill impairment is\nsensitive to market-based economics and other key assumptions used in determining or allocating fair value. Variability in\nthe market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate fair value are reasonably possible and\nmay have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nOur annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of July 1. The Company performed its 2023 annual\ngoodwill impairment qualitative assessment as of July 1, 2023 and performed a quantitative assessment as of October 31,\n2023 and determined the Company’s goodwill was not considered impaired.\nFor additional information regarding goodwill, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies,” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report and “Risk Factors—Operational Risks,”\nincluded in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\n39\nTable of Contents\nFair Values of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations\nLoans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value as adjusted for credit risk and an allowance\nfor credit losses at the date of acquisition. For loans with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination,\nthe difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized into\ninterest income using the effective interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity.\nLoans acquired with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, or PCD loans, are accounted for in\naccordance with ASC Topic 326-20 “Financial instruments - credit losses.” Determining the fair value of the loans involves\nestimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and\nthen discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. An allowance for credit losses is recognized by\nestimating the expected credit losses of the purchased asset and recording an adjustment to the acquisition date fair value to\nestablish the initial amortized cost basis of the asset. Differences between the established fair value, or amortized cost\nbasis, and the unpaid principal balance of the asset is considered to be a non-credit discount/premium and is accreted/\namortized into interest income using the interest method accounted for in accordance with ASC 310-10. Subsequent\nchanges to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit loss expense using the same\nmethodology as other loans held for investment.\nFor additional information regarding acquired loans, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies,” “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Acquisitions,” and “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements—Loans Held for Investment,” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis is intended to provide detail about the results of operations by comparing the\nyears ended December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2022. A similar discussion and analysis that compares the fiscal year\n2022 to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, may be found in Part II, Item 7, “Results of Operations” of our Form 10-\nK for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nNet Income\nNet income increased $55.3 million, or 27.3%, to $257.5 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, in 2023, compared to\n$202.2 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, in 2022. There were no acquisition related expenses in 2023 compared to $118.9\nmillion of acquisition related expenses incurred in 2022 related to the 2022 acquisition of GWB. The after-tax impact of\nacquisition related expenses on earnings per share was $0.90 in 2022.\nPerformance Ratios\nAs of or for the year ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021\nReturn on average assets 0.83 % 0.65 % 1.02 %\nReturn on average common stockholders’ equity 8.17 6.34 9.73\nEfficiency ratio (1) 62.50 67.83 61.94\nCommon stock dividend payout ratio (2) 75.81 86.73 52.56\n(1)Our efficiency ratio definition conforms with the FDIC definition for all periods presented as non-interest expense less amortization of\nintangible assets divided by net interest income plus non-interest income.\n(2)Common stock dividend payout ratio represents dividends per common share divided by basic earnings per common share.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income, the largest source of our operating income, is derived from interest, dividends, and fees received\non interest earning assets, less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities. Interest earning assets primarily\ninclude loans and investment securities. Interest bearing liabilities include deposits, short-term borrowings, and various\nother forms of indebtedness. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed\nof changes to interest rates, and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest-bearing\nliabilities.\nChanges in interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities,\nhas the most significant impact on net interest income. Other factors like volume of loans, investment securities, and other\ninterest earning assets compared to the volume of interest-bearing deposits, short-term borrowings, and other indebtedness\nalso cause changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest-bearing sources of funds, such as demand\ndeposits and stockholders’ equity, help to support earning assets.\n40\nTable of Contents\nNet interest income decreased $63.8 million during 2023, as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a\ndecrease in interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans and an increase in interest expense as a result of\nthe cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\nNet interest income included interest accretion related to the fair value of acquired loans of $20.4 million during 2023\nas compared to $50.4 million in 2022, of which $2.5 million was the result of early loan payoffs during 2023, as compared\nto $21.8 million in 2022. There were no material recoveries of previously charged-off loan interest in 2023 or 2022.\nOur net interest margin ratio decreased 21 basis points to 3.12% during 2023, as compared to 3.33% in 2022. Our net\nFTE interest margin ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure, decreased 22 basis points to 3.14% during 2023, as compared to\n3.36% in 2022. Exclusive of the impact of interest accretion on acquired loans and the impact of recoveries of charged-off\ninterest, our 2023 net FTE interest margin ratio decreased 11 basis points over our similarly calculated net interest margin\nratio in 2022.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, condensed average balance sheet information using daily\naverage balances, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense\nand rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities.\n41\nTable of Contents\nAverage Balance Sheets, Yields, and Rates\nYear Ended December 31,\n2023 2022 2021\nAverage Average Average Average Average Average\n(Dollars in millions) Balance Interest(2) Rate Balance Interest(2) Rate Balance Interest(2) Rate\nInterest earning assets:\nLoans(1) $ 18,299.6 $ 986.0 5.39 % $ 16,802.2 $ 797.2 4.74 % $ 9,788.9 $ 431.2 4.40 %\nInvestment securities\nTaxable 9,173.1 269.1 2.93 9,729.8 213.9 2.20 5,180.5 68.6 1.32\nTax-exempt 199.7 3.9 1.95 243.6 5.0 2.05 242.8 5.3 2.18\nInvestment in FHLB and FRB\nstock 207.5 12.4 5.98 116.6 4.8 4.12 53.4 1.0 1.87\nInterest-bearing deposits in banks 303.0 15.7 5.18 1,432.8 8.7 0.61 1,946.7 2.6 0.13\nFederal funds sold 0.5 — — 0.5 — — 0.1 — —\nTotal interest-earning assets 28,183.4 1,287.1 4.57 28,325.5 1,029.6 3.63 17,212.4 508.7 2.96\nNon-interest-earning assets 2,951.1 2,804.2 1,631.8\nTotal assets $ 31,134.5 $ 31,129.7 $ 18,844.2\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand deposits $ 6,553.3 $ 47.2 0.72 % $ 7,549.8 $ 15.7 0.21 % $ 4,459.6 $ 1.8 0.04 %\nSavings deposits 7,989.3 122.2 1.53 8,732.7 24.5 0.28 4,770.8 1.5 0.03\nTime deposits 2,676.3 73.2 2.74 1,577.0 8.1 0.51 1,009.3 4.8 0.48\nRepurchase agreements 940.4 6.4 0.68 1,114.5 2.5 0.22 1,025.2 0.4 0.04\nOther borrowed funds 2,514.6 133.8 5.32 411.1 15.3 3.72 — — —\nLong-term debt 120.8 5.8 4.80 122.2 6.0 4.91 112.4 6.0 5.34\nSubordinated debentures held by\nsubsidiary trusts 163.1 12.7 7.79 156.6 6.8 4.34 87.0 2.8 3.22\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities 20,957.8 401.3 1.91 19,663.9 78.9 0.40 11,464.3 17.3 0.15\nNon-interest-bearing deposits 6,549.9 7,911.6 5,227.9\nOther non-interest-bearing\nliabilities 475.9 364.7 177.9\nStockholders’ equity 3,150.9 3,189.5 1,974.1\nTotal liabilities and stockholders’\nequity $ 31,134.5 $ 31,129.7 $ 18,844.2\nNet FTE interest income (non-\nGAAP)(3) $ 885.8 $ 950.7 $ 491.4\nLess FTE adjustments(2) (7.0) (8.1) (2.2)\nNet interest income from\nconsolidated statements of income $ 878.8 $ 942.6 $ 489.2\nInterest rate spread 2.66 % 3.23 % 2.81 %\nNet interest margin 3.12 3.33 2.84\nNet FTE interest margin (non-\nGAAP)(3) 3.14 3.36 2.85\nCost of funds, including non-\ninterest-bearing demand deposits(4) 1.46 0.29 0.10\n(1) Average loan balances include mortgage loans held for sale and non-accrual loans.

The provision during 2023 includes a provision for credit losses of $31.1 million related\nto loans held for investment, provision for credit losses of $2.2 million related to unfunded commitments, and a reduction\nof credit losses of $1.1 million related to held-to-maturity securities. The allowance for credit losses is updated quarterly\nbased on the current loan and investment securities portfolios, asset quality metrics, and a review of the current economic\noutlook. The provision for credit losses is reflective of net charge-offs of $23.5 million, or 0.13% of average loans\noutstanding, for 2023, compared to $30.1 million, or 0.18% of average loans outstanding in 2022.\n43\nTable of Contents\nFor information regarding our non-performing loans, see “Non-Performing Assets” included herein.

Significant components\nof these fluctuations are discussed below.\nMortgage banking revenues include origination and processing fees on residential real estate loans held for sale, gains\non residential real estate loans sold to third parties, income earned from the servicing of mortgages originated by the\nCompany which are held by third parties, and any impairments to or subsequent recovery of the Company’s mortgage\nservicing rights valuation. Mortgage banking revenues decreased $10.3 million in 2023 as compared to the same period in\n2022, primarily as a result of the decline in home loan production volume as a result of rising interest rates, along with\ntighter gain-on-sale spreads compared to 2022. The realized revenue during 2023 was not impacted by a recovery of a\nprevious impairment of our mortgage servicing rights as compared with a $3.4 million recovery in 2022.\nOther service charges, commissions, and fees primarily include fees earned on certain derivative interest rate contracts,\ninsurance commissions, and safe deposit boxes. Other service charges, commissions, and fees decreased $6.0 million in\n2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to a decrease of $4.5 million in swap fee revenues earned on\nderivative interest rate swap contracts offered to clients.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense decreased $109.2 million in 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The decrease was\nprimarily a result of the $118.9 million decrease in acquisition expenses related the GWB acquisition incurred during 2022,\nin addition to lower incentive compensation accruals, partially offset by increased expenses in 2023 as a result of a full year\nof combined operations, post-GWB acquisition and a special FDIC insurance assessment of $10.5 million. Expenses\nrelated to acquisitions include legal fees, consulting fees, investment banking fees, conversion and contract termination\ncosts, and retention and severance compensation costs. Other significant components of non-interest expense are discussed\nbelow.

Salaries and wages expense decreased $19.0 million in 2023 as compared to the same\nperiod in 2022, primarily as a result of lower short-term incentives of $31.0 million, which were partially offset by higher\nsalaries and wages of $11.9 million as a result of the full year of combined operations, post-GWB acquisition and higher\nseverance costs.\nOutsourced technology services primarily include technology services related to the core system platform, software as a\nservice, automated teller machines, technology equipment and software maintenance. Outsourced technology services\nexpense increased $4.7 million in 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to inflationary impacts to\ntechnology contracts and costs associated with higher transaction volumes from a full year of expenses resulting from the\nGWB acquisition.\nOccupancy, net expense include building expenses such as lease, depreciation, rent, maintenance and repairs, property\ntaxes, snow removal, utility and janitorial, and insurance. Occupancy, net expense increased $4.0 million in 2023 as\ncompared to the same period in 2022, primarily due to increased expenses resulting from the GWB acquisition.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions and charges insured financial institutions premiums to\nmaintain the DIF at a specific level. FDIC insurance premiums increased $17.5 million in 2023 as compared to the same\nperiod in 2022, primarily attributable to the incremental two basis point assessment fee imposed by the FDIC which began\nin the first quarter of 2023 and the special assessment of $10.5 million to cover the losses incurred by the DIF in response\nto 2023 bank failures. Under the special assessment, the Bank was assessed 13.4 basis points annually on an assessment\nbase equal to its estimated uninsured deposits, after excluding the first $5 billion of uninsured deposits. The special\nassessment will be collected on a quarterly basis for eight quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2024, although the\nFDIC retained the flexibility to extend the special assessment period as well as impose a one-time shortfall assessment to\ncollect any remaining amount to fully recover the losses to the DIF.\nOther expenses primarily include advertising and public relations costs; office supply, postage, freight, telephone, and\ntravel expenses; donations expense; debit and credit card expenses; board of director fees; legal expenses; and other\noperational losses. Other expenses increased $7.0 million in 2023 as compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in\nother expenses are mainly attributable to an increase in our credit card rewards accrual as a result of higher engagement by\nour clients in our improved rewards program and swap servicing.\nAcquisition related expenses primarily include legal and professional fees; technology, conversion, and contract\ntermination costs; employee severance and retention payments; and travel expenses. There were no acquisition related\nexpenses incurred during 2023, compared to $118.9 million of acquisition related expenses incurred during 2022, related to\nthe 2022 acquisition of GWB. For additional information regarding our GWB acquisition, see “Recent Trends and\nDevelopments” included herein and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Acquisitions,” included in Part IV,\nItem 15 of this report.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective federal tax rate was 18.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 16.1% for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022. Fluctuations in effective federal income tax rates are primarily due to an increase in pre-tax income, a\ndecrease in net tax exempt interest income, a decrease in tax credits, and an increase in the non-deductible portion of FDIC\npremium expense, which was partially offset by an increase in the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance,\nand a decrease in non-deductible acquisition costs.\nState income tax applies primarily to pretax earnings generated within Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,\nMinnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, and South Dakota. Our effective state tax rate was 5.1%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFinancial Condition\nThe financial condition discussion below is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part IV, Item 15 of this\nReport. A similar discussion and analysis comparing fiscal year 2022 to fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 may be\nfound in Part II, Item 7, “Financial Condition” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022,\nwhich is incorporated herein by reference.\nTotal Assets\nTotal assets decreased $1,616.6 million, or 5.0%, to $30,671.2 million as of December 31, 2023, from $32,287.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to declines in deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements,\npartially offset by an increase in other borrowed funds. Significant fluctuations in balance sheet accounts are discussed\nbelow.\nInvestment Securities\nWe manage our investment portfolio to obtain the highest yield possible while meeting our risk tolerance and liquidity\nguidelines and satisfying the pledging requirements for deposits of state and political subdivisions and securities sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Our portfolio principally comprises U.S treasury notes, U.S. government agency, U.S. government\nagency commercial mortgage-backed securities, U.S. government residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized\nmortgage obligations, corporate securities, and tax-exempt securities. Debt securities rated in the highest category by\nnationally recognized rating agencies and debt securities backed by the U.S. Government and government sponsored\nagencies, both on a direct and indirect basis, represented approximately 94.8% of the investment portfolio’s HTM segment\nat December 31, 2023. All other held-to-maturity debt securities rated below AAA, not backed by the U.S. Government or\ngovernment sponsored agencies, or which are not rated represented approximately 5.2% of total HTM debt securities at\nDecember 31, 2023. Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits in the Bank are additional investments that are\nclassified as cash equivalents rather than as investment securities. Investment securities classified as available-for-sale are\nrecorded at fair value, while investment securities classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. Unrealized\ngains or losses, net of the deferred tax effect, on available-for-sale securities are reported as increases or decreases in\naccumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of stockholders’ equity.\nInvestment securities decreased $1,348.5 million, or 13.0%, to $9,049.4 million as of December 31, 2023, from\n$10,397.9 million as of December 31, 2022. The decrease was the result of the disposition of $853.0 million of investment\nsecurities during the first quarter of 2023, with proceeds primarily used to reduce short-term borrowings, and normal\namortization of the portfolio, partially offset by increases in fair market values and purchases of $134.7 million during the\nperiod.\nSee Notes “Investment Securities” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report for additional details.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the estimated duration of our investment portfolio was 3.5 years, as compared to 3.7 years as\nof December 31, 2022. The weighted average yield on investment securities increased 72 basis points to 2.91% in 2023,\nfrom 2.19% in 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2023, investment securities with amortized costs and fair values of $3,858.6 million and $3,462.2\nmillion, respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements, as compared\nto $4,998.9 million and $4,432.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. For additional information concerning\nsecurities sold under repurchase agreements, see “—Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements” included herein.\n46\nTable of Contents\nMortgage-backed securities and, to a limited extent other securities, have uncertain cash flow characteristics that\npresent additional interest rate risk in the form of prepayment or extension risk primarily caused by changes in market\ninterest rates. This additional risk is generally rewarded in the form of higher yields. Maturities of mortgage-backed\nsecurities presented below are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date. Expected maturities may\ndiffer from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations. As of December 31,\n2023, the carrying value of our investments in non-agency mortgage-backed securities totaled $241.3 million. All other\nmortgage-backed securities included in the table below were issued by U.S. government entities and sponsored entities. As\nof December 31, 2023, there were no significant concentrations of investments (greater than 10% of stockholders’ equity)\nin any individual security issuer, except for U.S. government or agency-backed securities.\nApproximately 74.2% and 77.9% of our tax-exempt securities were general obligation securities as of December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, of which 31.1% and 38.0%, respectively, were issued by political subdivisions or agencies\nwithin the states we operate, including Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,\nNorth Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had investment securities with fair values aggregating $8,284.5 million that had been in a\ncontinuous loss position more than 12 months. Gross unrealized losses on these securities totaled $803.4 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, and were attributable to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the\nCompany had no allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities and an allowance for credit losses on held-to\nmaturity securities classified as corporate and municipal securities of $0.8 million and $1.9 million, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth the carrying value as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the percentage of total\ninvestment securities and weighted average yields on investment securities as of December 31, 2023. Weighted-average\nyields have been computed on a fully taxable-equivalent basis using a tax rate of 21%.\n47\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,\n2022 December 31, 2023\nSecurities Maturities and Yield Carrying Carrying % of Total Investment Weighted Average\n(Dollars in millions) Value Value Securities FTE Yield\nU.S. Treasury securities\nMaturing within one year $ — $ 299.7 3.31 % 2.17 %\nMaturing in one to five years 871.2 349.5 3.86 2.00\nMaturing in five to ten years 200.6 — — —\nMark-to-market adjustments on securities available-for-sale (32.4) (25.5) (0.28) NA\nTotal 1,039.4 623.7 6.89 2.08\nU.S. government agency securities\nMaturing within one year 0.6 0.6 0.01 3.17\nMaturing in one to five years 163.5 176.2 1.95 2.12\nMaturing in five to ten years 400.2 353.8 3.91 2.27\nMaturing after ten years 3.6 3.3 0.04 5.57\nMark-to-market adjustments on securities available-for-sale (17.3) (10.9) (0.12) NA\nTotal 550.6 523.0 5.79 2.25\nMortgage-backed securities\nMaturing within one year 24.4 44.9 0.50 2.98\nMaturing in one to five years 908.1 684.3 7.55 2.62\nMaturing in five to ten years 1,312.6 1,115.7 12.33 2.16\nMaturing after ten years 5,149.4 4,613.0 50.98 2.30\nMark-to-market adjustments on securities available-for-sale (462.7) (366.4) (4.05) NA\nTotal 6,931.8 6,091.5 67.31 2.31\nCollateralized loan obligation securities\nMaturing in five to ten years 204.0 180.6 2.00 5.81\nMaturing after ten years 941.2 941.2 10.40 6.01\nMark-to-market adjustments on securities available-for-sale (33.6) (2.2) (0.02) NA\nTotal 1,111.6 1,119.6 12.38 5.98\nMunicipal securities\nMaturing within one year 10.5 4.0 0.04 2.75\nMaturing in one to five years 56.5 41.5 0.46 3.02\nMaturing in five to ten years 116.0 159.5 1.76 1.68\nMaturing after ten years 312.4 230.9 2.55 1.88\nMark-to-market adjustments on securities available-for-sale (50.7) (36.9) (0.41) NA\nTotal 444.7 399.0 4.40 1.92\nCorporate securities\nMaturing within one year 15.8 — — —\nMaturing in one to five years 87.2 99.6 1.10 2.62\nMaturing in five to ten years 249.4 218.2 2.41 3.04\nMark-to-market adjustments on securities available-for-sale (32.6) (25.2) (0.28) NA\nTotal 319.8 292.6 3.23 2.91\nTotal $ 10,397.9 $ 9,049.4 100.00 % 2.73 %\nMaturities of the 2023 securities noted above reflect $1,603.3 million of investment securities at their final maturities,\nwhich have call provisions within the next year. Based on current market interest rates, management expects approximately\n$1.0 million of these securities will be called in 2024. For additional information concerning investment securities, see\n“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Investment Securities” included in Part IV, Item 15.\nFederal Reserve Bank (FRB) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) Stock\nThe Bank is a member of the FHLB of Minneapolis and the FRB system. Members are required to own a certain\namount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company held $223.2 million and $198.6 million, respectively, in equity\nsecurities in a combination of FRB and FHLB stocks, which are restricted nonmarketable securities acquired to meet\nregulatory requirements. These securities are carried at cost.\n48\nTable of Contents\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale consist of residential mortgage loans pending sale to investors in the secondary market and loans\nreclassified from loans held for investment due to management’s intent and decision to sell the loans. Loans held for sale\ndecreased $32.5 million, or 40.7%, to $47.4 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $79.9 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to the transfer of $29.6 million of agricultural loans to loans held for investment, the\ntransfer of a $6.4 million construction real estate loan to OREO, the repayment or pay-off of $15.5 million of loans, and a\ndecrease in mortgage loan activity. The decrease was partially offset by the transfer of a $27.3 million commercial real\nestate loan from loans held for investment to loans held for sale during 2023.\nLoans Held for Investment, Net of Deferred Fees and Costs\nThe following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio as of the dates indicated:\nLoans Outstanding\n(Dollars in millions)\nAs of December 31,\n2023 Percent 2022 Percent 2021 Percent\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 8,869.2 48.4 % $ 8,528.6 47.1 % $ 3,971.5 42.5 %\nConstruction 1,826.5 10.0 1,944.4 10.8 1,007.8 10.8\nResidential 2,244.3 12.3 2,188.3 12.1 1,538.2 16.5\nAgricultural 716.8 3.9 794.9 4.4 213.9 2.3\nTotal real estate 13,656.8 74.6 13,456.2 74.4 6,731.4 72.1 %\nConsumer:\nIndirect 740.9 4.1 829.7 4.6 737.6 7.9\nDirect 141.6 0.8 152.9 0.8 129.2 1.4\nCredit card 76.5 0.4 75.9 0.4 64.9 0.7\nTotal consumer 959.0 5.3 1,058.5 5.8 931.7 10.0\nCommercial 2,906.8 15.9 2,882.6 15.9 1,475.5 15.8\nAgricultural 769.4 4.2 708.3 3.9 203.9 2.1\nOther, including overdrafts 0.1 — 9.2 — 1.5 —\nLoans held for investment 18,292.1 100.0 % 18,114.8 100.0 % 9,344.0 100.0 %\nDeferred loan fees and costs (12.5) (15.6) (12.3)\nLoans held for investment, net of deferred fees and costs 18,279.6 18,099.2 9,331.7\nAllowance for credit losses (227.7) (220.1) (122.3)\nNet loans held for investment $ 18,051.9 $ 17,879.1 $ 9,209.4\nAllowance for credit losses to loans held for investment 1.25 % 1.22 % 1.31 %\nLoans held for investment, net of deferred fees and costs, increased $180.4 million, or 1.0%, to $18,279.6 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023, as compared to $18,099.2 million as of December 31, 2022,\nReal Estate Loans. We provide interim construction and permanent financing for both single-family and multi-unit\nproperties, medium-term loans for commercial, agricultural and industrial property and/or buildings and equity lines of\ncredit secured by real estate.\nCommercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans include loans for property and improvements used\ncommercially by the borrower or for lease to others for the production of goods or services. Approximately 34.4% and\n37.0% of our commercial real estate loans were owner occupied as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nConstruction loans. Construction loans are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the\nconstruction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties. Construction loans are generally\nunderwritten pursuant to pre-approved permanent financing. As of December 31, 2023, our construction loan portfolio was\ndivided among the following categories: approximately $343.6 million, or 18.8%, residential construction; approximately\n$1,147.9 million, or 62.9%, commercial construction; and approximately $335.0 million, or 18.3%, land acquisition and\ndevelopment.\nResidential real estate loans. Residential real estate loans are typically secured by first liens on the financed property.\nIncluded in residential real estate loans were home equity loans and lines of credit of $541.8 million, or 24.1%, and $548.9\nmillion, or 25.1%, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAgricultural real estate loans. Agricultural real estate loans are secured by farmland or ranchland consisting of short,\nintermediate, and long-term structures to experienced agriculturalists who have demonstrated management capabilities,\nestablished production and historical financial performance.\nConsumer Loans. Our consumer loans include direct personal loans; credit card loans and lines of credit; and indirect\nloans created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other\nconsumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve. Personal loans and indirect\ndealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other types of personal property and are\nmade on an installment basis. Credit cards are offered to clients in our market areas. Lines of credit are generally floating\nrate loans that are unsecured or secured by personal property. Approximately 77.3% and 78.4% of our consumer loans as\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were indirect consumer loans.\nCommercial Loans. We provide a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial loans. The loans are typically made to\nsmall and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service businesses for working capital needs and business\nexpansions. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit, business credit cards, and loans with maturities of five\nyears or less and outstanding balances tend to be cyclical in nature. The loans are generally made with business operations\nas the primary source of repayment and are typically collateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, and/or\npersonal guarantees.\nAgricultural Loans. Our agricultural loans generally consist of short- and medium-term loans and lines of credit that are\nprimarily used for crops, livestock, equipment, and general operations. Agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by assets\nsuch as livestock or equipment and are repaid from the operations of the farm or ranch. Agricultural loans generally have\nmaturities of five years or less, with operating lines for one production season.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturity distribution and interest rates of our loan portfolio as of\nDecember 31, 2023. The amounts provided below do not reflect scheduled repayment or prepayment assumptions related\nto the loan portfolio. The within one year category includes loans overdrafts and loans with no stated maturity.\nMaturities and Interest Rate Sensitivities\n(Dollars in millions) Contractual Maturity Range Maturing After One Year\nWithin One Year to Five Years to After Fixed Interest Floating/Variable\nOne Year Five Years Fifteen Years Fifteen Years Total Rate Interest Rate\nReal estate $ 1,152.1 $ 4,671.5 $ 5,703.0 $ 2,130.2 $ 13,656.8 $ 7,606.8 $ 4,897.9\nConsumer 103.8 427.4 374.8 53.0 959.0 844.5 10.7\nCommercial 872.0 1,168.6 760.3 105.9 2,906.8 1,354.4 680.4\nAgricultural 573.0 157.4 33.7 5.3 769.4 177.0 19.4\nOther 0.1 — — — 0.1 — —\nLoans held for investment $ 2,701.0 $ 6,424.9 $ 6,871.8 $ 2,294.4 $ 18,292.1 $ 9,982.7 $ 5,608.4\nNon-Performing Assets\nNon-performing assets include non-accrual loans, loans contractually past due by 90 days or more and still accruing\ninterest, and OREO.\nNon-accrual loans. We generally place loans on non-accrual status when they become 90 days past due unless they are\nwell secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued\nbut not collected is reversed from income. Non-accrual loans increased $47.2 million, to $106.4 million, as of\nDecember 31, 2023, from $59.2 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily due to a $28.7 million agricultural loan\ntransferred loans held for sale to loans held for investment and a construction real estate and commercial real estate loan.\nAccruing loans past due 90 days or more decreased $1.5 million, or 23.4% driven by a decrease in all loan types except for\nagricultural loans as a result of the transfer of a loan from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. Loans are\nreturned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when, in the\nopinion of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest.\n50\nTable of Contents\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO). OREO consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral\nunderlying defaulted loans. We initially record OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs. Any excess of loan carrying\nvalue over the fair value of the real estate acquired is recorded as a charge against the allowance for credit losses. Estimated\nlosses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to earnings in the period in which they\nare identified. The fair values of OREO properties are estimated using appraisals and management estimates of current\nmarket conditions. OREO properties are appraised every 18-24 months unless deterioration in local market conditions\nindicates the need to obtain new appraisals sooner.\nOREO properties are evaluated by management quarterly to determine if additional write-downs are appropriate or\nnecessary based on current market conditions. Quarterly evaluations include a review of the most recent appraisal of the\nproperty and reviews of recent appraisals and comparable sales data for similar properties in the same or adjacent market\nareas. Commercial and agricultural OREO properties are listed with unrelated third party professional real estate agents or\nbrokers local to the areas where the marketed properties are located. Residential properties are typically listed with local\nrealtors, after any redemption period has expired. We rely on these local real estate agents and/or brokers to list the\nproperties on the local multiple listing system, to provide marketing materials and advertisements for the properties, and to\nconduct open houses.\nOREO increased to $16.5 million as of December 31, 2023, from $12.7 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily\nattributable to the transfer of a $5.8 million loan held for sale to OREO, partially offset by dispositions.

Collateral-dependent loans rely solely on the operation or sale of the collateral for\nrepayment. In evaluating the overall risk associated with a loan, the Company considers character, overall financial\ncondition and resources, and payment record of the borrower; the prospects for support from any financially responsible\nguarantors; and the nature and degree of protection provided by the cash flow and value of any underlying collateral. The\nloan may become collateral-dependent where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and as sources of repayment\nbecome inadequate over time and that repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of\nthe collateral. Collateral-dependent loans increased to $52.6 million as of December 31, 2023, from $39.1 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily due to a construction loan.\nModifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications of loans are made in the ordinary course of\nbusiness and are completed on a case-by-case basis through negotiation with the borrower in connection with the ongoing\nloan collection processes. Loan modifications are made to provide borrowers payment relief. From time to time, we may\nmodify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some cases, these modifications may result\nin new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty may be in the form of principal\nforgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or a term extension or a combination\nthereof, among other things. Those modifications deemed to be for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are\nmonitored centrally to ensure proper classification and if or when the loan may be placed on accrual status.\nEffective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, which eliminated accounting guidance for troubled\ndebt restructurings while requiring disclosures of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for modifications related to\nprincipal reductions, interest rate reductions, term extensions, and more than insignificant payment delay. See “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements—Recent Authoritative Accounting Guidance” included in financial statements included\nPart IV, Item 15 of this report for further discussion of the amendments in this update. For additional information regarding\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Loans\nHeld For Investment” included in financial statements included Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company performs a quarterly assessment of the appropriateness of its allowance for credit losses in accordance\nwith GAAP. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses based on our evaluation of\nquantitative and qualitative risk factors in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for\ncredit losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the expected loss can be identified and\nreasonably determined over the life of the loans. The balance of the allowance for credit losses is based on internally\nassigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature or tenure of the loan portfolio, overall\nportfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current environmental and economic factors, and the\nestimated impact of forecasted economic conditions on historical loan loss rates. See the discussion under “Critical\nAccounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies — Allowance for Credit Losses” above.\nThe allowance for credit losses is increased by provisions charged against earnings and net recoveries of charged-off\nloans and is reduced by negative provisions credited to earnings and net loan charge-offs. The allowance for credit losses\nconsists of three elements:\n52\nTable of Contents\n(1) Specific valuation allowances associated with collateral-dependent and other individually evaluated loans.\nSpecific valuation allowances are determined based on assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the\nloans as determined through independent appraisals, the present value of future cash flows, observable market\nprices, and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting loans.\n(2) Collective valuation allowances based on loan loss experience and future expectations for similar loans with\nsimilar characteristics and trends. The Company applies open pool methodologies for all portfolio segments. The\nopen pool methodology averages quarterly loss rates by modeling segment, calculated as quarter-to-date net\ncharge off balance divided by the end of period balance. Loss rates are recalculated quarterly with recoveries\ncaptured in the quarter a loan was charged off, are averaged across a look back period from 2009 to the current\nperiod, and are annualized. Macroeconomic-conditioned historical loss rates are applied to loan-level cash flows.\nExpected future principal and interest cash flows are calculated using contractual repayment terms and\nprepayment, utilization, interest rate, and probability of default assumptions. Macroeconomic sensitivity models\ncalculate segment-specific multipliers using third party forecast data. The multipliers condition the annual loss\nrates over the 2-year forecast period, followed by a 1-year straight-line reversion to the unadjusted historical\naverage loss rates. The unadjusted loss rates then apply for the remaining life of the loan. Estimated losses are\ntotaled and aggregated to the segment level.\n(3) General valuation allowances determined based on asset quality trends, industry concentrations, environmental\nrisks, changes in portfolio composition, and other qualitative risk factors, both internal and external to the\nCompany. Other qualitative factors, including changes in loan and lending policies, collateral quality,\nunderwriting standards and personnel, credit review quality, and model imprecision, are also considered.\nBased on the assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses, the Company records provisions for\ncredit losses to maintain the allowance for credit losses at appropriate levels.\nLoans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value as adjusted for credit risk and an allowance\nfor credit losses at the date of acquisition. For loans with no significant evidence of credit deterioration since origination,\nthe difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance of the loan at the acquisition date is amortized into\ninterest income using the effective interest method over the remaining period to contractual maturity. An allowance for\ncredit loss is recorded for the expected credit losses over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit\nlosses are recorded through provision expense using the same methodology as other loans held for investment.\nFor loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination, the\nCompany determines the fair value of the loans by estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows\ninitially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. An\nallowance for credit losses is recognized by estimating the expected credit losses of the purchased asset and recording an\nadjustment to the acquisition date fair value to establish the initial amortized cost basis of the asset. Differences between\nthe established amortized cost basis, and the unpaid principal balance of the asset, is considered to be a non-credit discount/\npremium and is accreted/amortized into interest income using the level yield interest method. Subsequent changes to the\nallowance for credit losses are recorded through provision expense using the same methodology as other loans held for\ninvestment.\nLoans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses when management believes the\ncollectability of the principal is unlikely, or, with respect to consumer installment loans, according to an established\ndelinquency schedule. Generally, loans are charged-off when (1) there has been no material principal reduction within the\nprevious 90 days and there is no pending sale of collateral or other assets, (2) there is no significant or pending event which\nwill result in principal reduction within the upcoming 90 days, (3) it is clear that we will not be able to collect all or a\nportion of the loan, (4) payments on the loan are sporadic, will result in an excessive amortization, or are not consistent\nwith the collateral held, or (5) foreclosure or repossession actions are pending. Loan charge-offs do not directly correspond\nwith the receipt of independent appraisals or the use of observable market data if the collateral value is determined to be\nsufficient to repay the principal balance of the loan.\nIf a collateral-dependent loan is adequately collateralized, a specific valuation allowance for credit losses is not\nrecorded. As such, significant changes in collateral-dependent and non-performing loans do not necessarily correspond\nproportionally with changes in the specific valuation component of the allowance for credit losses. Additionally, the\nCompany expects the timing of charge-offs will vary between quarters and will not necessarily correspond proportionally\nto changes in the allowance for credit losses or changes in non-performing or collateral-dependent loans due to timing\ndifferences among the initial identification of a collateral-dependent loan, recording of a specific valuation allowance for\ncollateral-dependent loans, and any resulting charge-off of uncollectible principal.\nOur allowance for credit losses on loans was $227.7 million, or 1.25% of loans held for investment as of December 31,\n2023, as compared to $220.1 million, or 1.22% of loans held for investment, as of December 31, 2022. The increase in the\npercentage from December 31, 2022 is primarily a result of loan growth and credit migration.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have established our allowance for credit losses in accordance with GAAP in the United States and we\nbelieve that the allowance for credit losses is appropriate to provide for known and expected losses in the portfolio at all\ntimes, future provisions will be subject to on-going evaluations of the risks in the loan portfolio. If the economy declines or\nasset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required.

These decreases were partially offset by an\nincrease in other borrowed funds. Significant fluctuations in liability accounts are discussed below.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits decreased $1,750.5 million, to $23,323.1 million as of December 31, 2023, from $25,073.6 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, with decreases in all types of deposits with the exception of time deposits.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service, or CDARS, deposits of\n$26.6 million and $36.6 million, respectively.

Other borrowed funds increased $276.0 million, to $2,603.0 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to\n2,327.0 million at December 31, 2022, primarily as a result of a decrease in total deposits and securities under repurchase\nagreements, partially offset by a decline in investment securities and cash and cash equivalents.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCapital Resources\nStockholders’ equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock, and\nchanges in the unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities. Stockholders’\nequity increased $153.7 million, or 5.0%, to $3,227.5 million as of December 31, 2023 from $3,073.8 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022, due to changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to unrealized gains on available-for-\nsale securities and retention of earnings, which are partially offset by stock repurchases of vested restricted shares tendered\nin lieu of cash for payment of income tax withholding amounts by participants, a stock purchase pursuant to an agreement,\nand cash dividends paid. Regular cash dividends paid to common shareholders during 2023 amounted to approximately\n$195.1 million.\nOn January 26, 2024, we declared a quarterly dividend to common stockholders of $0.47 per share, which was paid on\nFebruary 19, 2024 to shareholders of record as of February 9, 2024. The dividend equates to a 7.2% annual yield based on\nthe $26.01 average closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported on NASDAQ during the fourth quarter of\n2023.\nOn December 14, 2023, the Company completed the repurchase of one million shares of its common stock from the\nestate of a stockholder at a price of $32.14 per share, or the closing price per share of the common stock as reported on the\nNasdaq Stock Market on December 14, 2023, representing an aggregate purchase price of $32.1 million. For additional\ninformation regarding the repurchase, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Related Party Transactions”\nincluded in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nDuring 2022, the Company repurchased and retired the five million shares of common stock under its previously\nexisting stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have a repurchase program in effect.\n56\nTable of Contents\nFor additional information regarding the repurchases, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Capital Stock\nand Dividend Restrictions” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nDuring 2023, the Company issued 54,414 shares of its common stock to directors for their annual service on the\nCompany’s board of directors. The aggregate value of the shares issued to directors of $1.2 million is amortized into stock-\nbased compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity over a one-\nyear service-based period.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company must comply with the capital requirements established by the Federal\nReserve, and our subsidiary Bank must comply with the capital requirements established by the FDIC. The current risk-\nbased guidelines applicable to us and our Bank are based on the Basel III framework, as implemented by the federal bank\nregulators. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the guidelines to\nbe deemed “well-capitalized.”\nFor additional information regarding our capital levels, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Regulatory\nCapital,” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nLiquidity\nLiquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost.\nWe manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of clients, while maintaining an appropriate balance\nbetween assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is\nsupported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include\ncash, interest bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold, available-for-sale investment securities, and maturing or\nprepaying balances in our held-to-maturity investment and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, federal\nfunds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale\nof loans, the ability to acquire additional national market funds through non-core deposits, the issuance of additional\ncollateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, additional borrowings through the\nFederal Reserve’s discount window or BTFP, and the issuance of preferred or common securities.\nThe primary effect of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs. In our management’s opinion,\nchanges in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the\ninflation rate. While interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate, they do not necessarily change at\nthe same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are\nbeyond our control, including changes in the expected rate of inflation, the influence of general and local economic\nconditions, and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government, its agencies, and various other\ngovernmental regulatory authorities.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to\nmake future payments. Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations,\nincluding payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures, and shareholder\ndividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying\nand maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, debt financing, and increases in client deposits. For additional\ninformation regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see “Consolidated Financial Statements—\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows,” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nThe Company had deposits without a stated maturity of $20,313.2 million and time deposits of $2,648.7 million, due in\none year or less in addition to time deposits due in more than one year of $361.2 million as of December 31, 2023. For\nadditional details in regard to the Company’s deposits see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Deposits”\nincluded in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had securities sold under repurchase agreements of $782.7 million due in one\nyear or less as the agreements with our client counterparties mature on the next banking day.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $2,603.0 million of FHLB borrowings due in less than one year, $99.0\nmillion of fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due in more than one year, and available borrowing capacity of\n$3,619.6 million with the FHLB. The Company has unused federal fund lines of credit with third parties amounting to\n$235.0 million, subject to funds availability. These lines are subject to cancellation without notice. The Company also has\nan unused line of credit with the FRB for borrowings up to $3,039.5 million secured by government and agency backed\nsecurities and a blanket pledge of agricultural and commercial loans and has an unused $50.0 million revolving line of\ncredit with another third party. For additional information concerning long-term debt, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements—Long Term Debt and Other Borrowed Funds” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe Company guarantees the distribution and payment for redemption or liquidation of capital trust preferred securities\nissued by our wholly owned subsidiary business trusts to the extent of funds held by the trusts. Although the guarantees are\nnot separately recorded, the obligations underlying the guarantees are fully reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as\nsubordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts. The subordinated debentures currently qualify as tier 2 capital under the\nFederal Reserve capital adequacy guidelines. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had subordinated debentures held by\nsubsidiary trusts of $163.1 million due in more than one year. For additional information concerning the subordinated\ndebentures, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Subordinated Debentures Held by Subsidiary Trusts”\nincluded in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nThe Company has future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of maintenance and operating costs, required under\noperating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31, 2023 with\n$11.6 million due in one year or less and $39.0 million due in more than one year. For additional information concerning\nleases, see “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies” included in Part IV, Item 15\nof this report.\nThe Company is a limited partner in several tax-advantaged limited partnerships that have been formed for the purpose\nof investing in approved qualified affordable housing, renewable energy, or other renovation or community revitalization\nprojects. As of December 31, 2023, the Company expects to recover its investments through the use of tax credits\ngenerated by the investments.\nThe Company has entered into various arrangements not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet that have or are\nreasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company had unused credit card lines of $814.0 million, commitments to extend credit of\n$4,069.2 million and standby letters of credit of $97.1 million. Among the $4,069.2 million in credit commitments\noutstanding, $658.5 million are related to home equity and home equity lines of credit, $1,786.4 million are related to\ntraditional working capital commercial lines, and $926.9 million are unfunded for current or future construction projects.\nSince many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not\nnecessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our off-balance sheet arrangements,\nsee “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk” included in Part IV,\nItem 15 of this report.\nAs a bank holding company, we are a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary Bank and, therefore, we\nprovide for our own liquidity. Our primary sources of funding include management fees and dividends declared and paid\nby the Bank and access to capital markets. There are statutory, regulatory, and debt covenant limitations that affect the\nability of our Bank to pay dividends to us. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet\nour ongoing short-term cash obligations. For additional information regarding dividend restrictions, see “Financial\nCondition—Capital Resources and Liquidity” above, “Business—Government Regulation and Supervision—Dividends\nand Restrictions on Transfers of Funds” included in Part I, Item 1 of this report, and “Risk Factors—Liquidity Risks and\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks” included in Part I, Item 1A of this report.\nManagement continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources\nand uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Our management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources, or operations. In addition, our management is not aware of any\nregulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. Our business and the composition of our balance sheet consists\nof investments in interest earning assets (principally loans and investment securities) which are primarily funded by interest\nbearing liabilities (deposits and indebtedness). Such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in\nmarket interest rates such as the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed of changes in interest rates, and\nchanges in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk results\nwhen, due to different maturity dates and repricing intervals, interest rate indices for interest earning assets fluctuate\nadversely relative to interest bearing liabilities, thereby creating a risk of decreased net earnings and cash flow.\nAlthough we characterize some of our interest-sensitive assets as securities available-for-sale, such securities are not\npurchased with the intent to sell in the near term. Rather, such securities may be sold in response to or in anticipation of\nchanges in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk. We do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any\nportion of the investment portfolio as trading. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\n58\nTable of Contents\nAsset Liability Management\nThe goal of asset liability management is the prudent control of market risk, liquidity, and capital. Asset liability\nmanagement is governed by policies, goals, and objectives adopted and reviewed by the Bank’s board of directors.\nDevelopment of asset liability management strategies and monitoring of interest rate risk are the responsibility of the Asset\nLiability Committee, or ALCO, which is composed of members of senior management.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or long-term value due to changes in interest rates. Our primary\nsource of earnings is net interest income, which is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates, the speed\nof changes in interest rates, the relationship between rates on interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the impact of interest\nrate fluctuations on asset prepayments, and the mix of interest-bearing assets and liabilities.\nThe ability to optimize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of an interest rate spread that can\nbe managed during periods of fluctuating interest rates. Interest sensitivity is a measure of the extent to which net interest\nincome will be affected by market interest rates over a period of time.\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity\nWe believe net interest income sensitivity provides the best perspective of how day-to-day decisions affect our interest\nrate risk profile. We monitor net interest income sensitivity by utilizing an income simulation model to subject 12- and 24-\nmonth net interest income to various rate movements. Simulations modeled quarterly include scenarios where market rates\nchange instantaneously up or down in a parallel or non-parallel manner. Estimates produced by our income simulation\nmodel are based on numerous assumptions including, but not limited to: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2)\nshifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) repricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments, (4) differing\nsensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices, (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for\ndifferent interest rate scenarios, (6) the effect of interest rate limitations in our assets, such as caps and floors, and (7)\noverall growth and repayment rates and product mix of assets and liabilities. Because of limitations inherent in any\napproach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change\nin market interest rates on our results, but rather to provide insight into our current interest rate exposure and execute\nappropriate asset/liability management strategies accordingly.\nThe following table presents the net interest income simulation model’s projected change in net interest income over a\none-year horizon due to a change in interest rates. The net interest income simulation assumes parallel shifts in the yield\ncurve and a static balance sheet. The net interest income simulation also uses a “deposit beta” modeling assumption which\nis an estimate of the change in interest-bearing deposit pricing for a given change in market interest rates. In up-rate\nscenarios, the deposit beta assumption is 30% with the pricing change occurring in the first month of the net interest\nincome simulation horizon. In down-rate scenarios, the deposit beta assumption is 50% with the pricing change occurring\nin the first month of the net interest income simulation horizon. Actual changes to deposit pricing may vary significantly\nfrom this assumption due to management actions, customer behavior, and market forces, which may have significant\nimpacts to our net interest income. The net interest income simulations at December 31, 2023 project that interest-bearing\nliabilities reprice faster than our interest earning assets.\nChange in Interest Rate Percent Change in Net Interest Income\n(basis points) December 31, 2023\n+200 (8.13)%\n+100 (4.01)%\n-100 6.42%\n-200 10.94%\nThe preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being\nindicative of expected operating results.\nThe Company uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. In August 2022, the\nCompany entered into two interest rate collars related to variable-rate loans that were designated as cash flow hedges with\na total notional amount of $300.0 million. The collars designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fix the interest income\nreceived by the Company when the collar index falls below a floor rate on a rate reset during the term of the collar and\nwhen the collar index exceeds the cap rate on a rate reset during the term of the collar without exchange of the underlying\nnotional amount. In October 2022, the Company entered into four forward starting receive-fixed hedges related to pools of\nvariable-rate loans and securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of $850.0 million.\nThe swaps designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fix the interest income received by the Company when they\nbecome effective. As of December 31, 2023, $900.0 million of the cash flow hedges were effective with the remaining\n$250.0 million becoming effective in April 2024.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe expected impact of accounting standards recently issued but not yet adopted are discussed in “Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements—Authoritative Accounting Guidance” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.\nItem 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nof the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2023, our management evaluated, under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of\nour disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of December 31, 2023, were effective in ensuring that\ninformation required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,\nsummarized, and reported within the time periods required by the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to\nallow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as\ndefined under Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in\naccordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of records that in\nreasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with proper\nauthorizations; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use\nor disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAll internal control over financial reporting processes and systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent\nlimitations. Therefore, even processes and systems deemed to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future\nperiods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the criteria and guidelines established in\nthe Internal Control--Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission. Based on such assessment, management determined that the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, to the extent of the material weakness discussed below.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing determination, the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and the\nmaterial weakness described in this report did not result in any material misstatement in our consolidated financial\nstatements or other disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n60\nTable of Contents\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such\nthat there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with its evaluation and assessment, the following combined\ndeficiencies culminating in a material weakness have been identified by management.\nOur management concluded that the Company’s control over the establishment of new deposit accounts was not\neffectively designed to fully consider all of the relevant attributes and the sufficiency of the coverage of this control was\nnot documented or assessed. In addition, segregation of duties over the establishment of new loan accounts and the\nmaintenance of loan and deposit accounts was not adequately enforced by the workflow system. The Company also did not\nhave effective information technology general controls (ITGCs) supporting the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting related to the documentation of the completeness and accuracy of user access to systems, change management\nsegregation of duties over two systems, and sufficient identification of transfers between systems. These combined\ndeficiencies, which in aggregate result in a material weakness, impact other automated and manual business process\ncontrols in the control environment that are dependent on the ineffective controls.\nA discussion of the remediation steps that the Company has undertaken, including subsequent to year-end, to better\ndefine and document the appropriateness of its control environment and eliminate each of the deficiencies is provided\nbelow in this Item 9A under the caption “—Management’s Remediation Plan”, which immediately follows the more\nspecific description of the above identified deficiencies.\nImportantly, and as noted above, the deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and the material\nweakness described in this report did not result in any material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements or\nother disclosures. These deficiencies merely were determined to create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement\nof our consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nRSM US LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2023. RSM US LLP’s report is presented below this management report in Item 9A of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nManagement’s Remediation Plan\nBeginning in July 2023, we pivoted from 100% testing of new deposit account attributes to sampling at up to a 30%\ntesting approach of new deposit account attributes. The redesign did not adequately define the sampling methodology,\nincluding escalation procedures, and did not include all key deposit account attributes.\nRegarding the remediation of the deficiency concerning the testing of new deposit account attributes, subsequent to\nyear-end we engaged independent third-party consultants to assist us in evaluating the appropriateness and effectiveness of\nour testing approach and quantifying the reasonableness of the sample size. In addition, subsequent to year-end, we\nperformed further testing over 2023 new deposit accounts with no material findings. We also took steps to ensure inclusion\nof all relevant fields to financial reporting within the scope of the review of new deposit accounts, revise sampling\nprocedures to achieve additional precision, included rationale for sampling approach based on required exception rates for\na material misstatement to be possible, and will include escalation procedures.\nWith respect to our workflow system associated with the establishment of new loan accounts and the maintenance of\nloan and deposit accounts, our workflow system is configured to automatically identify individuals who performed a\ndeposit or loan boarding or maintenance activity and deny them access to perform a review of the activity performed. It\nwas determined, however, that the workflow system had a vulnerability that could allow employees to edit some keywords\nassociated with documents and workflows. It was determined that this vulnerability could pose segregation of duties\nconcerns as employees with account boarding and maintenance access could bypass the control to allow them to perform\nquality control on their own activity.\nWith respect to the remediation of the segregation of duties deficiency related to our workflow system, upon\nidentification of the deficiency, management promptly removed the ability of an employee to edit relevant ‘keyword’ fields\nin the workflow system to ensure appropriate level of system access. Following the remediation efforts, management\nperformed a review of activity, including a review of workflow system logs, engaged in during 2023 to seek to identify any\npotential instances of unauthorized changes to keywords and investigate instances of actual segregation of duties violations\nrelated to deposit account maintenance and loan boarding and maintenance activity, and no unauthorized changes or\nviolations were identified.\n61\nTable of Contents\nOur ITGC user access review and validation control activity has been established to ensure that system and application\naccess remain appropriate for each employee’s job role. During 2023, the Company onboarded a new system to increase\nthe automation of user access reviews, intending to ensure complete and accurate populations were considered as part of\nthe control activity. During the third quarter of 2023, it was determined that existing procedures should have more detail,\nand management updated the Company’s processes and expanded its written procedures for obtaining complete and\naccurate populations of user access reviews for each system with a manual population and held training sessions with\nsystem administrators to increase detail and add support and seek to remediate the deficiency. Additionally, during the\nfourth quarter of 2023, a quality assurance process was implemented to add another layer of control prior to the finalization\nof each periodic user’s access review. Management further intends to continue to identify systems that are compatible with\nthe automation feature to further reduce manual processes, to consider timing of testing for systems subject to annual user\naccess review, to review and enhance written procedures for obtaining accurate populations of user access, and conduct\nadditional training with system administrators to further communicate the requirements of the periodic access review\nprocess, all with a view to promptly eliminate this deficiency.\nRegarding the identified ITGC change management deficiency, technical limitations resulting in segregation of duties\nconflicts in the standard control environment were identified for changes deployed for two systems. A documented, weekly\nattestation and sign off is completed by management to attest to the review period; however, the preparer and reviewer are\nnot independent of the activity to which they are attesting. In addition, due to an employee’s leave of absence, the existing\ncontrol activity was not operational for part of 2023. The employee resumed documentation of the review and the related\nattestation of implemented changes process upon return from leave, and thereafter a retroactive review was performed to\nensure that there were no unauthorized changes to the systems while the employee was on leave. Because the remediation\nefforts to alleviate the segregation of duties concerns were not completed prior to year-end, it was determined that the\nexisting technical limitations resulted in segregation of duties conflicts in the standard control environment at year end.\nIn order to remediate the identified change management deficiency, management has initiated a project to migrate to an\nalternate cloud solution that is expected to enable logical access implementation to support segregation of duties\nrequirements through automation.\nThe ITGCs deficiency related to the sufficient identification of transfers between only those systems supporting the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting relates to the listing of relevant, specific transfers not being produced\nuntil December 2023. The Company identified all transfers between systems, which by definition included those systems\nsupporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, but it did not produce separately the more limited\nuniverse of systems subsumed by the larger universe. In addition, the control did not include sufficient logging and\nmonitoring activities to demonstrate the effective execution of the control.\nTo remediate the Company’s deficiency in producing the sufficient identification of transfers between only those\nsystems supporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, management in December 2023 enhanced its\nreporting capabilities to identify only data transfers supporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nFurthermore, documentation of the control is being enhanced to ensure adequate system logging and monitoring for the\nprompt elimination of the deficiency.\nBy completing these remediation steps, our automated and manual business process controls that are dependent on the\neffectiveness of these remediated controls and ITGCs have been and will continue to be improved, with the effect that\nmanagement believes that it will be able to remediate and eliminate the material weakness during 2024.\nWe have already completed some and are in the process of effecting other remediation efforts related to the\ndeficiencies identified above. Remediation will not be considered complete until such controls have been properly tested\nfor design and operating effectiveness by management and the external auditor.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter\nended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting, other than as described above regarding the remediation activities concerning the onboarding of a\nnew system to increase the automation of user access reviews and the Company’s deficiency in producing the sufficient\nidentification of transfers between only those systems supporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting,\nthe discussion with respect to which is incorporated herein by reference.\n62\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.\nOpinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.'s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness\ndescribed below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated\nstatements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and our report dated February 29, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's\nassessment:\nThe Company’s control over the establishment of new deposit accounts was not effectively designed to fully consider all of\nthe relevant attributes and the sufficiency of the coverage of this control was not documented or assessed. In addition,\nsegregation of duties over the establishment of new loan accounts and the maintenance of loan and deposit accounts was not\nadequately enforced by the workflow system. The Company also did not have effective information technology general controls\n(ITGCs) supporting the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to the documentation of the completeness\nand accuracy of user access to systems, change management segregation of duties over two systems, and sufficient identification\nof transfers between systems. These combined deficiencies impact other automated and manual business process controls in the\ncontrol environment that are dependent on the ineffective controls.\nThis material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the\n2023 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 29, 2024 on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk\nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the\nassessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n63\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nDes Moines, Iowa\nFebruary 29, 2024\n64\nTable of Contents\nItem 9B.

Such audited consolidated financial statements follow:\n66\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. and its subsidiaries\n(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income,\nstockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related\nnotes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,\nand the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission in 2013. Our report dated February 29, 2024 expressed an opinion that the Company had not\nmaintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission in 2023.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits\nalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts\nor disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment\nThe Company’s loans held for investment portfolio totaled $18,279.6 million as of December 31, 2023, and the\nassociated allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment was $227.7 million. As described in Notes 1 and 6 to\nthe financial statements, the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment is a valuation account that is deducted\nfrom the Company’s amortized cost basis of loans held for investment to present the net amount of loans held for\ninvestment expected to be collected. Expected future principal and interest cash flows are calculated using contractual\nrepayment terms while considering prepayment, utilization, interest rate, and probability of default assumptions.\nMacroeconomic models calculate segment-specific multipliers using third party forecast data. The multipliers adjust the\nannual loss rates to the level expected under the economic conditions over the 2-year forecast period, followed by a 1-year\nstraight-line reversion to the unadjusted historical average loss rates. The unadjusted loss rates then apply for the remaining\nlife of the loan. The Company’s allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment consists of three elements: (1)\nspecific valuation allowances associated with collateral-dependent loans; (2) historical valuation allowances based on loan\nloss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends and segment-specific multipliers using third party\nforecast data; and (3) adjustments to historical loss information for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics\nsuch as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix and trends, asset quality, or term as well as for changes in\nenvironmental and economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors.\n67\nTable of Contents\nWe identified the adjustments to historical loss information component of the allowance for credit losses on loans held\nfor investment, both as it relates to current conditions and economic forecast selection, as a critical audit matter, because\nauditing this component of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment required significant auditor\njudgement related to estimates determined by management which are highly subjective and are highly sensitive to change\nin significant assumptions.\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s adjustments to historical loss information component of the allowance\nfor credit losses on loans held for investment included the following, among others:\n• We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the allowance for credit losses on loans held for\ninvestment and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls relating to\nmanagement’s review and approval of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment calculation,\nmanagement’s approval of economic forecast selection used to derive segment-specific multipliers within its\nmacroeconomic model, management’s assessment and review of the adjustments to historical loss information\ncomponent of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment for current conditions, and\nmanagement’s validation of underlying source data.\n• We tested management’s calculation of adjustments to historical loss information within the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans held for investment calculation by agreeing calculation inputs to the Company’s internal and\nexternal source data, verifying the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of adjustments to historical loss\ninformation, and evaluating whether adjustments to historical loss information within the allowance for credit\nlosses on loans held for investment, or lack thereof, were reasonable and consistent with Company provided\ninternal data and external independent data.\n• We evaluated management’s selected economic forecast, used to derive segment-specific multipliers within its\nmacroeconomic model, for reasonableness against alternative industry sources.\n• We agreed management’s calculated adjustments to historical loss information to the allowance for credit losses\non loans held for investment calculation.\nGoodwill\nThe Company’s goodwill totaled $1,100.9 million as of December 31, 2023. As described in Notes 1 and 3 to the\nfinancial statements, the Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event\nor circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. As a result of the ongoing\nfinancial services economic conditions, including changes to the interest rate environment, continued volatility in the\nCompany’s common share price, and volatility in the Company’s overall market capitalization during the third and\nbeginning of the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed a quantitative interim goodwill impairment assessment for\nits sole reporting unit as of October 31, 2023 by weighting income and market-based approaches. The income approach\nmeasures the fair value of an interest in a business by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. The market\napproaches take into consideration fair values of comparable companies operating in similar lines of business that are\npotentially subject to similar economic and environmental factors and could be considered reasonable investment\nalternatives. The result of the income and market approaches were weighted in determining the fair value of the reporting\nunit.\nWe identified management’s estimation of the fair value of its reporting unit as a critical audit matter, because the\nestimation of fair value required management to make significant assumptions and estimates around forecasted net income,\nthe selection of discount rates, the selection of control premiums utilized in the valuation and the weighting of valuation\nmethods used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. In addition, our audit procedures to evaluate the\nreasonableness of management’s net income forecasts, selection of discount rates, selection of control premiums and\nweighting of valuation methods utilized in the valuation required a higher degree of auditor judgement as well as an\nincreased level of audit effort, including the involvement of valuation specialists related to valuation inputs determined by\nmanagement which are highly subjective and are highly sensitive to change in significant assumptions.\nOur audit procedures related to our evaluation of the reasonableness of the Company’s net income forecasts, selection\nof discount rates, selection of the control premium utilized and weighting of the methods in the valuation included the\nfollowing, among others:\n• We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to net income forecasts and the selection of the\ndiscount rate, control premium and the weighting of valuation methods, and tested such controls for design and\noperating effectiveness, including controls relating to management’s review and approval of the net income\nforecasts, the selection of the discount rate and control premium and the weighting of valuation methods.\n68\nTable of Contents\n• We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast net income by comparing actual results to\nmanagement’s historical forecasts.\n• We evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in management’s net income forecasts by: 1) comparing to\nindustry forecasts and information included in industry analyst reports; 2) considering the impact of changes in the\ncompetitive and regulatory environment on management’s forecast; and 3) assessing the reasonableness of\nstrategic plans incorporated by the Company into the forecasts.\n• We utilized internal valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the discount rate, the control premium selected by\nmanagement and the weighting of valuation methods used in determining the fair value of the reporting unit. The\nevaluation included evaluating the reasonableness of market-based source information underlying the selection of\nthe discount rate and control premium, testing the reasonableness of management’s method, developing\nindependent expectations, and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate, control premium and weighting of\nvaluation methods calculations\n/s/ RSM US LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004.\nDes Moines, Iowa\nFebruary 29, 2024\n69\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\n(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBusiness. First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. (the “Parent Company” and collectively with its subsidiaries, the\n“Company”) is a financial and bank holding company that, through the branch offices of its bank subsidiary,\nprovides a comprehensive range of banking products and services to individuals, businesses, municipalities, and\nother entities throughout Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North\nDakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Washington, and Wyoming. In addition to its primary emphasis on commercial and\nconsumer banking services, the Company also offers trust, employee benefit, investment, and insurance services\nthrough its bank subsidiary. The Company is subject to competition from other financial institutions and nonbank\nfinancial companies, and is also subject to the regulations of various government agencies and undergoes periodic\nexaminations by those regulatory authorities.\nBasis of Presentation. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent\nCompany and its operating subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had one significant subsidiary,\nFirst Interstate Bank (“FIB”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in\nconsolidation. Certain reclassifications, none of which were material, have been made in the consolidated financial\nstatements for 2022 and 2021 to conform to the 2023 presentation. These reclassifications did not change previously\nreported net income or stockholders’ equity.\nBusiness Combinations. The Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of\naccounting. Under this method of accounting, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are included with the acquirer's\naccounts as of the date of acquisition, with any excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired\nrecognized as either finite lived intangibles or capitalized as goodwill. In addition, acquisition related costs and\nrestructuring costs are recognized as period expenses as incurred. Fair values are subject to refinement over the\nmeasurement period, not to exceed one year after the closing date.\nEquity Method Investments. The Company has investments in real estate joint ventures that are not consolidated\nbecause the Company does not own a majority voting interest, control the operations, or receive a majority of the\nlosses or earnings of the joint venture. These joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting\nwhereby the Company initially records its investment at cost (or fair value at the date of acquisition) and then\nsubsequently adjusts the carrying value for the Company’s proportionate share of distributions and earnings or\nlosses of the joint ventures.\nVariable Interest Entities. The Company’s wholly owned business trusts, FI Statutory Trust I (“Trust I”), FI\nCapital Trust II (“Trust II”), FI Statutory Trust III (“Trust III”), FI Capital Trust IV (“Trust IV”), FI Statutory Trust\nV (“Trust V”), FI Statutory Trust VI (“Trust VI”), Northwest Bancorporation Capital Trust I (“Trust VII”), GWB\nCapital Trust VI (“Trust VIII”), Sunstate Bancshares Trust II (Trust IX”), Great Western Statutory Trust IV (“Trust\nX”), HF Financial Capital Trust III (“Trust XI”), HF Trust IV (“Trust XII”), HF Trust V (“Trust XIII”), and HF\nTrust VI (“Trust XIV”) are variable interest entities for which the Company is not a primary beneficiary.\nAccordingly, the accounts of Trust I through Trust XIV are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements, and are instead accounted for using the equity method of accounting.\nThe Company has equity investments in variable interest Certified Development Entities (“CDEs”) which have\nreceived allocations under the New Markets Tax Credits Program. The underlying activities of the CDEs are\ncommunity development projects designed primarily to promote community welfare, such as economic\nrehabilitation and development of low-income areas by providing housing, services, or jobs for residents. The\nmaximum exposure to loss in the CDEs is the amount of equity invested and credit extended by the Company. The\nCompany has credit protection in the form of indemnification agreements, guarantees, and collateral arrangements.\nAssets Held in Fiduciary or Agency Capacity. The Company holds certain trust assets in a fiduciary or agency\ncapacity. The Company also purchases and sells federal funds as an agent. These and other assets held in an agency\nor fiduciary capacity are not assets of the Company and, accordingly, are not included in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements.\n76\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results\ncould differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change relate to the\ndetermination of the allowance for credit losses, the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, and fair values of\ninvestment securities and other financial instruments.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand,\namounts due from banks, federal funds sold for less than three-month periods, and interest-bearing deposits in banks\nwith original maturities of less than three months. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had cash of\n$199.0 million and $518.9 million, respectively, on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). On March 15,\n2020, the Federal Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero percent effective March 26, 2020. This action\neliminated reserve requirements for all depository institutions.\nDebt Security Investments. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to\nhold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost. Investments in debt securities that\nmay be sold in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates and resulting prepayment risk, or other\nfactors, are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses on these\nsecurities are reported, net of applicable income taxes, as a separate component of stockholders’ equity and\ncomprehensive income. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase\nand at each reporting date management reassesses the appropriateness of the classification.\nThe amortized cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale is adjusted for accretion of\ndiscounts to maturity and amortization of premiums over the estimated average life of the security, without\nanticipating prepayments, except for mortgage-backed securities where prepayments are anticipated, or in the case\nof callable securities, through the first call date, using the effective yield method. Such amortization and accretion is\nincluded in interest income. Realized gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date in investment securities\ngains and losses and determined using the specific identification method.\nAccrued interest receivable on investment securities totaled $38.5 million and $38.9 million at December 31, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, and was reported in the accrued interest receivable line item on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Held-to-Maturity Securities: Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-\nmaturity debt securities on a collective basis by major security type. Accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity\ndebt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses. The estimate of expected credit losses considers\nhistorical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nManagement classifies the held-to-maturity portfolio into the following major security types:\nU.S. Treasury notes. U.S. Treasury notes issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury are guaranteed by the U.S.\ngovernment with very little risk to default.\nState, county, and municipal securities. Municipal bonds issued by municipal governments within the U.S. These\ntypes of securities are primarily composed of general obligation bonds, or municipal bonds backed by the credit and\ntaxing power of the issuing jurisdiction and revenue obligation bonds, or municipal bonds that are financed by\nincome-producing projects and are secured by a specified source of revenue. Municipal issues shall have at least a\n“BBB” rating by Moody's and/or Standard and Poor’s, or equivalent creditworthiness must be established prior to\npurchase. All non-rated or private placement securities must be analyzed and approved by the Company’s Credit\nDepartment and documented prior to purchase.\nObligations of U.S. government agencies and entities. Securities held by the Company are primarily issued by The\nFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac, and The Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation, known as Fannie Mae, which are implicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and are consistently\nhighly rated by major rating agencies with very little risk to default.\nU.S. agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Commercial mortgage-backed securities held by the\nCompany are primarily issued by U.S. government agencies and entities. These securities are either explicitly or\nimplicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, are consistently highly rated by major rating agencies with very little\nrisk to default.\n77\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nU.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Residential mortgage-backed securities held by the Company\nare primarily issued by U.S. government agencies and entities. These securities are either explicitly or implicitly\nguaranteed by the U.S. government, are consistently highly rated by major rating agencies with very little risk to\ndefault.\nCollateralized mortgage obligations. Collateralized mortgage obligations include agency and non-agency residential\nsecurities which carry ratings no lower than investment grade “BBB” and pass the federal financial institutions\nexaminations test (Collateral Mortgage Obligation volatility test) at the time of purchase.\nCorporate securities. Securities held by the Company are primarily comprised of corporate bonds (both senior and\nsubordinated-debt) issued by a firm or public entity which carry ratings no lower than investment grade “BBB” or\nbetter by Moody’, Standard and Poor’s, or Kroll rating agencies. All corporate subordinated-debt securities are\nanalyzed and approved by the Company prior to purchase.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available-For-Sale Securities: For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized\nloss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be\nrequired to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or\nrequirement to sell is met, the security's amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For\navailable-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company performs a qualitative\nassessment as to whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this\nassessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the\nrating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other\nfactors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected\nfrom the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows\nexpected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is\nrecorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any\nimpairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive\nincome.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss expense. Losses\nare charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is\nconfirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Accrued interest receivable on\navailable-for-sale debt securities is excluded from the estimate of credit losses.\nLoans Held for Sale. The Company originates certain loans intended for sale in the secondary market. Conforming\nagency mortgage production is sold on a servicing retained basis. Certain loans, such as government guaranteed\nmortgage loans, are sold on a servicing released basis. Residential loans the Company originated with the intent to\nsell are classified as loans held for sale and recorded at fair value, determined individually, as of the balance sheet\ndate. The loan’s fair value includes the servicing value of the loans as well as any accrued interest. The fair value of\nloans held for sale are primarily determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets or outstanding\ncommitments from third-party investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and\ncharged to non-interest income in the consolidated statements of operations. Net gains and losses on loan sales are\nrecorded as a component of non-interest income.\nPerforming residential real estate loans that are held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. Upon\nthe sale of an originated loan, the mortgage servicing right is recorded at its estimated fair value.\nLoans that are originated and classified as held for investment are periodically sold in order to manage liquidity,\nasset credit quality, interest rate risk, or concentration risk. Loans that are reclassified into loans held for sale from\nloans held for investment, due to a change in intent, are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell,\nexcept for certain loans which are recorded at fair value, determined individually, as of the balance sheet date. Any\nchanges in fair value attributable to credit deterioration at the time of transfer are charged against the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nLoans Held for Investment. Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or\nuntil maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost or principal balance outstanding. Amortized cost is the\nprincipal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts and deferred loan fees and costs. Loan\norigination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the\nlevel-yield method without anticipating prepayments.\n78\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nAccrued interest receivable on loans held for investment totaled $86.1 million and $76.5 million at December 31,\n2023 and 2022, respectively, and was reported in the accrued interest receivable line item on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance of underlying loans. Interest income on\nmortgage and commercial loans is discontinued and placed on nonaccrual status at the time the loan is 90 days\ndelinquent unless the loan is well secured and in process of collection.\nMortgage loans that are 180 days past due and commercial loans are charged off to the extent principal or interest is\ndeemed uncollectible. Consumer and credit card loans continue to accrue interest until they are charged off no later\nthan 120 days past due unless the loan is in the process of collection. Past-due status is based on the contractual\nterms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of\nprincipal or interest is considered doubtful.\nAll interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. Interest\nreceived on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to\naccrual. Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the loan balance is reduced to zero.\nUnder the cash-basis method, interest income is recorded when the payment is received in cash. Loans are returned\nto accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and when, in the\nopinion of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) Loans\nThe Company has loans acquired through acquisitions, some of which have experienced more than insignificant\ncredit deterioration since origination. Loans that meet at least one of the following criteria are considered to have\nexperienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination at the date of acquisition: 1) have\nexperienced more than one delinquency of more than 60 days or 60+ days as of the acquisition date; 2) have been\nplaced on nonaccrual status at any point since origination; 3) are special mention, substandard, doubtful as of the\nacquisition date; 4) have experienced a modification to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as of the\nacquisition date; or 5) are in high-risk industries based on macroeconomic conditions and local market conditions of\nthe acquired entity on the acquisition date. PCD loans are recorded at the amount paid for the loan. An allowance for\ncredit losses is determined using the same methodology as other loans held for investment. The initial allowance for\ncredit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price\nand allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized\ncost basis and the par value of the loan is a noncredit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income\nover the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision\nexpense.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans held for investment\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company transitioned its Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard\n(“CECL”), or ASC 326, model. The new model utilizes fewer portfolio loss segments than the old model due to\nlimited observations of data within certain portfolio loss segments under the old model. The new model calculates\nhistorical loss rates by averaging quarterly net charge-offs for each loss segment. The loss rates are macroeconomic-\nconditioned and applied to loan-level expected cash flows based on contractual repayment terms. The loss rates also\nconsider prepayment, utilization, interest rate, and probability of default assumptions. This change did not result in a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s financial statements.\nThe allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present\nthe net amount expected to be collected over the life of the loans. Loans are charged off against the allowance when\nmanagement determines that a loan balance cannot be collected. The Company applies recoveries when received and\nhas elected not to forecast recoveries for purposes of calculating the allowance for credit losses.\nManagement estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external\nsources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss\nexperience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information\nare made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards,\nportfolio mix and trends, asset quality, or term. Other loan-specific risk characteristics may include changes in\nenvironmental and economic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant\nfactors.\n79\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist.\nAnnualized loss rates are recalculated quarterly, with subsequent recoveries captured in the quarter a loan was\ncharged off and are averaged across a look back period from 2009 to the current period. Expected future principal\nand interest cash flows are calculated using contractual repayment terms while considering prepayment, utilization,\ninterest rate, and probability of default assumptions. Macroeconomic models calculate segment-specific multipliers\nusing third party forecast data. The multipliers adjust the annual loss rates to the level expected under the economic\nconditions over the 2-year forecast period, followed by a 1-year straight-line reversion to the unadjusted historical\naverage loss rates. The unadjusted loss rates then apply for the remaining life of the loan. Estimated losses are\ntotaled and aggregated to the portfolio segment level.\nThe Company segments the loan portfolio into pools based on the following risk characteristics: financial asset type,\ncollateral type, loan structure, credit characteristics, outstanding loan balances, contractual terms and prepayment\nassumptions, utilization assumptions, industry of borrower and concentrations, and historical or expected credit loss.\nThe Company has identified the following portfolio segments:\nReal Estate loans. Include commercial real estate loans which are non-farm, non-residential real estate loans\ngenerally secured by first liens on income-producing real estate and generally mature in less than 10 years;\nconstruction development loans which are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the\nconstruction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties, commercial construction loans which\nare primarily made to commercial builders for the development of commercial real estate properties; and\nconstruction and development loans which are generally underwritten pursuant to credit worthiness or pre-\nqualification for permanent financing. During the construction phase for any of the above loans, the borrower pays\ninterest only. In most cases, construction and development loans generally transition to a permanent real estate loans\nor otherwise mature in three years or less.\nReal estate loans also include agricultural real estate loans that generally mature in ten years or less, secured by\nfarmland or ranchland. These loans fund the construction of short, intermediate, and long-term structures and are\nmade to experienced agriculturalists who have demonstrated management capabilities, established production and\nhistorical financial performance. Real estate loans also include consumer home equity and home equity lines of\ncredit (“HELOC”) that are secured by residential property and generally mature in 25 years or less, and residential\nloans which are loans to finance the purchase or refinance of residential property which are typically secured by first\nliens or are construction loans to commercial builders or owner occupants for the construction of single-family\nresidences. Residential 1-4 family loans generally mature within 15 years, and in some instances, could mature up to\n30 years. Construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to credit worthiness or pre-qualification for\npermanent financing. During the construction phase the borrower pays interest only. Residential construction loans\ngenerally transition to a permanent residential loan or otherwise mature in two years or less.\nConsumer loans. Include indirect, direct advance lines, and credit cards. Indirect are loan contracts advanced for the\npurchase of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer networks within our\nmarket areas. Indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats, and other types\nof personal property and are made on an installment basis. Consumer indirect line loans generally mature in seven\nyears or less. Consumer direct and advance line loans are originated for a variety of purposes including the purchase\nof automobiles, boats and other consumer goods, home improvements, medical expenses, vehicle repairs, debt\nconsolidation, and planned expenses in addition to the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other consumer goods.\nConsumer direct and advance line loans generally mature in seven years or less. Consumer credit card loans are lines\nof credit offered to clients in our market areas that are generally floating rate loans and include both unsecured and\nsecured lines. Consumer credit card loans generally do not have stated maturities but are reviewed periodically and\nare unconditionally cancellable.\nCommercial loans. Include commercial and industrial loans through a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial\nloans, including loans to finance showroom floor inventories and other loans for commercial purposes that are\nsecured by 1-4 family residential property. These loans are typically made to small and medium-sized\nmanufacturing, wholesale, retail, and service businesses for working capital needs and business expansions. Floor\nplan loans and commercial purpose loans secured by 1-4 family residential property generally mature in seven years\nor less. Commercial loans also include secured and unsecured lines of credit, business credit cards, and loans with\nmaturities of five years or less. Outstanding balances on these commercial loans tend to be cyclical in nature. These\nloans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, and are typically\ncollateralized by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, and/or personal guarantees.\n80\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nAgricultural loans. Agricultural loans generally consist of short and medium-term loans and lines of credit that are\nprimarily used for crops, livestock, equipment, and general operations. Agricultural loans are ordinarily secured by\nassets such as livestock or equipment and are repaid from the operations of the farm or ranch. Agricultural loans\ngenerally have maturities of seven years or less, with operating lines for one production season.\nContractual Term. Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for\nexpected prepayments, defaults, interest rates, and utilization rates. The contractual term excludes expected\nextensions, renewals, and modifications unless either management has a reasonable expectation at the reporting date\nthat a modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty will be executed or the extension or renewal\noptions are included in the original or modified contract at the reporting date and are not unconditionally cancellable\nby the Company.\nA loan for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing\nfinancial difficulties, is considered to be a modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The\nallowance for credit loss on a modification to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is measured using the same\nmethod as all other loans held for investment, except when the loan is individually assessed for credit loss.\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures. The Company estimates expected credit\nlosses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to\nextend credit unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. Management considers our\nunused credit card lines and federal fund lines, extended to others, to be unconditionally cancellable. The allowance\nfor credit losses on off-balance sheet credit exposures is adjusted as a provision for credit loss expense. The estimate\nconsiders the likelihood that funding will occur and includes expected credit losses on commitments expected to be\nfunded over the estimated life.\nThe Company has identified commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit determined not to be\nunconditionally cancellable as categories with off-balance sheet credit exposures and uses the commitment balance,\nexpected loss rate, expected cash flows, and utilization rate as primary assumptions to develop the allowance for\ncredit losses on those exposures. The utilization rate represents management’s best estimate of the probability that\nthe unfunded portion of the commitment will be funded given existing economic conditions.\nGoodwill. The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for\nimpairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment\nhas occurred. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying\namount. In any given year the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value. If it is not more likely\nthan not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass\nthe qualitative assessment, a quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for\nimpairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on analyses of the Company’s market value, discounted\ncash flows and peer values. The determination of goodwill impairment is sensitive to market-based economics and\nother key assumptions used in determining or allocating fair value. Variability in the market and changes in\nassumptions or subjective measurements used to allocate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.\nCore Deposit and Other Customer Relationship Intangibles. Intangible assets consist of core deposit intangibles\nand other customer relationship intangibles. Core deposit intangibles represent the intangible value of depositor\nrelationships resulting from deposit liabilities assumed, as a result of acquisitions, and are amortized using an\naccelerated method based on the estimated weighted average useful lives of the related deposits, which is generally\nten years. Other customer relationship intangibles represent the value of the identifiable intangible value assigned to\ncustomer relationships arising from acquired companies and are amortized using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful life, which is 12 years.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The Company recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans for others, whether\nacquired or internally originated. Mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value based on comparable\nmarket data and are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. Mortgage\nservicing rights are evaluated quarterly for impairment by discounting the expected future cash flows, taking into\nconsideration the estimated level of prepayments based on current industry expectations and the predominant risk\ncharacteristics of the underlying loans including loan type, note rate, and loan term. Impairment adjustments, if any,\nare recorded through a valuation allowance.\n81\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nPremises and Equipment. Buildings, furniture, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.\nDepreciation expense is computed using straight-line methods over estimated useful lives of 5 to 45 years for\nbuildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements and assets\nacquired under a financing lease are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the\nrelated leases. Land is recorded at cost. Costs incurred for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\nWe have leased branches and office space and have entered into various other agreements in conducting our\nbusiness. Operating lease right-of-use assets are included within the Premises and Equipment line item and our\noperating lease liability is included within the Other Liabilities line item. Operating lease expense is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over the lease term, subject to any changes in the lease or expectations regarding the terms.\nVariable lease costs such as property taxes are expensed as incurred. Lease and non-lease components are accounted\nfor separately as the amounts are readily determinable under our lease contracts. Leases with an initial term of 12\nmonths or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nIn recognizing lease right-of use assets and related lease liabilities, we determine whether an agreement represents a\nlease and at commencement of the lease we evaluate each agreement to determine whether the lease is an operating\nor financing lease. Some of our lease agreements have contained renewal options, tenant improvement allowances,\nrent holidays, and rent escalation clauses. We hold one financing lease with the remaining leases classified as\noperating leases. Right-of-use lease assets represent our right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and the\nlease obligation represents our commitment to make the lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use lease\nassets and obligations are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease\npayments over the lease term. For the Company’s leases that do not provide an implicit rate, we use an estimated\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present\nvalue of lease payments. The right-of-use lease asset includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and\nexcludes any lease incentives. The estimated lease term may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it\nis reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nCompany-Owned Life Insurance. Key executive and group life insurance policies are recorded at their cash\nsurrender value. Separate account group life insurance policies are subject to a stable value contract that offsets the\nimpact of interest rate fluctuations on the market value of the policies and are recorded at the stabilized investment\nvalue. Increases in the cash surrender or stabilized investment value of insurance policies, as well as insurance\nproceeds received, are recorded as other non-interest income, and are not subject to income taxes.\nDeferred Compensation Plan. The Company has a deferred compensation plan for the benefit of certain highly\ncompensated officers and directors of the Company. The plan allows for discretionary employer contributions in\nexcess of tax limits applicable to the Company’s 401(k) plan and the deferral of salary, short-term incentives, or\ndirector fees subject to certain limitations. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities are included in the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred compensation\nplan assets were $19.2 million and $18.7 million, respectively. Corresponding deferred compensation plan liabilities\nwere $19.2 million and $18.7 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets, including premises and equipment and certain identifiable\nintangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount\nof an asset may not be recoverable. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is based on the asset’s fair value. No\nimpairment losses were recognized in 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO). Real estate acquired in satisfaction of loans is initially carried at current fair\nvalue less estimated selling costs. Any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate acquired is\nrecorded as a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Subsequent declines in fair value less estimated selling costs\nare included in OREO expense. Subsequent increases in fair value less estimated selling costs are recorded as a\nreduction in OREO expense to the extent of recognized losses. Operating expenses, net of related income, and gains\nor losses on sales are included in OREO expense.\n82\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nRestricted Equity Securities. The Company, as a member of the FRB and the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des\nMoines (“FHLB”), is required to maintain investments in each of the organization’s capital stock. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, restricted equity securities of the FRB of $94.2 million and $93.6 million,\nrespectively, and restricted equity securities of the FHLB of $127.8 million and $103.8 million, respectively, in\naddition to other equity securities of $1.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, were included in the consolidated\nbalance sheets caption FHLB and FRB stock, at cost. No ready market exists for the FHLB and FRB restricted\nequity securities, and they have no quoted market values. Restricted equity securities are periodically reviewed for\nimpairment based on ultimate recovery of par value.\nThe determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recovery of par value is influenced by the significance of\nthe decline compared to the cost basis of the restricted equity securities, length of time a decline has persisted,\nimpact of legislative and regulatory changes on the issuing organizations, and the liquidity positions of the issuing\norganizations. Based on management’s assessment, no impairment losses were recorded on restricted equity\nsecurities during 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities. For asset and liability management purposes, the Company enters into interest\nrate swap contracts to hedge against changes in forecasted cash flows due to interest rate exposures. Interest rate\nswaps are contracts in which a series of interest payments are exchanged over a prescribed period. The notional\namount upon which the interest payments are based is not exchanged.\nThe Company formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that\nare used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items. The gain or\nloss on cash flow hedging instruments is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and\nsubsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the transaction affects earnings.\nWhen it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective\nhedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (a) it is determined that the derivative is no\nlonger effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item (including forecasted transactions); (b) the\nderivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (c) the derivative is de-designated as a hedge instrument,\nbecause it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur; or (d) management determines that designation of the\nderivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate.\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the\nderivative will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, and gains and losses that were\naccumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognized immediately in earnings. In all other situations in\nwhich hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value on the balance sheet, with\nsubsequent changes in its fair value recognized in current-period earnings.\nThe Company also enters into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.\nThese derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a client\nwhile at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with a third-party financial institution. Because\nthe Company acts as an intermediary for the client, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts\nfor the most part offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company’s results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments to finance residential\nmortgage loans that are not designated as accounting hedges. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration\ndates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes\nwithin the timeframe established by the Company. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently\nclosed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the\ninvestor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and\nare marked to market through earnings. In addition to the effects of the change in market interest rate, the fair value\nmeasurement of the derivative also contemplates the expected cash flows to be received from the counterparty from\nthe future sale of the loan.\n83\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nThe Company sells residential mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis. The Company\nmitigates the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing interest rate lock commitments by entering into\nforward loan sales contracts. During the interest rate lock commitment period, these forward loan sales contracts are\nmarked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value\ncomponent associated with the projected cash flows from the loan delivery to the investor, the changes in fair value\nrelated to movements in market rates of the interest rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts\ngenerally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the\nloan commitment period is generally inconsequential. When the loan is funded to the borrower, the interest rate lock\ncommitment derivative expires and the Company records a loan held for sale. The forward loan sales contract acts as\na hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale. The changes in measurement of the\nestimated fair values of the interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales contracts are included in mortgage\nbanking revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nSoftware. Capitalized software, stated at cost less accumulated amortization, includes purchased software,\ncapitalizable application development costs associated with internally developed software, and cloud computing\narrangements, including capitalizable implementation costs associated with hosting arrangements that are service\ncontracts. Capitalized software is included in premises and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization expense, generally computed on the straight-line method, is charged to\nfurniture and equipment in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the estimated useful life of the software,\ngenerally three to five years, or the term of the hosting arrangement for implementation costs related to service\ncontracts. Cloud computing arrangements include software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS),\ninfrastructure as a service (IaaS) and other similar hosting arrangements. The Company primarily utilizes SaaS and\nPaaS arrangements. Capitalized implementation costs of hosting arrangements that are service contracts were\n$2.3 million and $3.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEarnings Per Common Share. Basic and diluted earnings per common share are calculated using a two-class\nmethod. Under the two-class method, basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net income\navailable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod, excluding outstanding participating securities. Participating securities include non-vested performance\nrestricted stock awards granted and all non-vested time restricted stock awards. Diluted earnings per common share\nis calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common\nshares outstanding determined for the basic earnings per share calculation plus the dilutive effect of stock\ncompensation using the treasury stock method.\nIncome Taxes. The Parent Company and its subsidiaries have elected to be included in a consolidated federal\nincome tax return. For state income tax purposes, the combined taxable income of the Parent Company and its\nsubsidiaries is apportioned among the states in which operations take place. Federal and state income taxes\nattributable to the subsidiaries, computed on a separate return basis, are paid to or received from the Parent\nCompany.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method. Under the liability method, deferred tax assets\nand liabilities are determined based on enacted income tax rates which will be in effect when the differences\nbetween the financial statement carrying values and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be\nreported in taxable income.\nPositions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon\nexamination. Uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than\nnot the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and\nsubsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon\nsettlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. The Company\nprovides for interest and, in some cases, penalties on tax positions that may be challenged by the taxing authorities.\nInterest expense is recognized beginning in the first period that such interest would begin accruing. Penalties are\nrecognized in the period that the Company claims the position in the tax return. Interest and penalties on income tax\nuncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. With few\nexceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state examinations by tax authorities for years\nbefore 2020. The Company had no material penalties as of December 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\n84\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nRevenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue as it is earned based on contractual terms, as transactions\noccur, or as services are provided and collectability is reasonably assured. The principal source of revenue is interest\nincome from loans and investments. The Company also earns non-interest income from various banking and\nfinancial services offered to its clients. Certain specific policies related to non-interest income include the following:\nWealth management and trust fee income\nWealth management and trust fee income represents monthly or other periodic fees due from wealth management\nclients as consideration for managing the clients’ assets. Wealth management and trust services include custody of\nassets, investment management, fees for trust services and similar fiduciary activities. Revenue is recognized when\nour performance obligation is completed. The Company does not earn performance-based incentives. Optional\nservices such as estate settlement and other court appointed services are available to existing trust and asset\nmanagement clients. The Company’s performance obligation for these transactional-based services is generally\nsatisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time.\nService charges on deposit accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts represent general service fees for account maintenance and activity- or\ntransaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based\nrevenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when our performance obligation\nis completed for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been completed (such as a wire transfer or\ncheck orders). Payment for such performance obligations are generally received at a point in time when the\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nInterchange and other fees\nInterchange and other fees primarily represent debit and credit card income comprised of interchange fees earned\nwhenever the Company’s debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks such as MasterCard.\nATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company\ncardholder uses a Company ATM. Merchant services income primarily represents fees charged to merchants to\nprocess their debit and credit card transactions, in addition to account management fees. Swap fee income primarily\nrepresents income associated with the execution of dealer bank swap agreements. Other service charges include\nrevenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashier’s checks, and other services. The Company’s\nperformance obligation for interchange and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue\nrecognized, when completion of the services are rendered at a point in time.\nAnnuity and insurance commissions\nAnnuity and insurance commissions primarily represent commissions received on annuity and insurance product\nsales. The Company acts as an intermediary between the Company’s client and the insurance carrier. The\nCompany’s performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the annuity or insurance policy, the\ncarrier then remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue at a point in\ntime.\nComprehensive Income (Loss). Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income, as well as other changes in\nstockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with shareholders. In\naddition to net income, the Company’s comprehensive income (loss) includes the after tax effect of changes in\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities and derivatives designated as fair value or\ncash flow hedges, and changes in the unamortized gain or loss on available-for-sale investment securities transferred\nto held-to-maturity.\nSegment Reporting. An operating segment is defined as a component of a business for which separate financial\ninformation is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate\nresources and evaluate performance. The “Segment Reporting” topic of the FASB ASC requires that public\ncompanies report certain information about operating segments. It also requires that public companies report certain\ninformation about their products and services, the geographic areas in which they operate, and their major clients.\nThe Company is a holding company for a regional community bank, which offers a wide array of products and\nservices to its clients. The Company has one reporting unit and one operating segment, community banking, which\nencompasses commercial and consumer banking services offered to individuals, businesses, municipalities and other\nentities.\n85\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nAdvertising Costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $0.9 million, $3.8 million,\nand $2.6 million in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nTransfers of Financial Assets. Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets\nhas been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated\nfrom the Company; the transferee obtains the right, free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that\nright, to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and, the Company does not maintain effective control over the\ntransferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nStock-Based Compensation. Compensation cost for all stock-based awards is measured at fair value on the date of\ngrant and is recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. The impact of forfeitures of\nstock-based payment awards on compensation expense is recognized as forfeitures occur. Stock-based compensation\nexpense of $4.7 million, $9.6 million, and $8.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively, is included in benefits expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Related income\ntax expense (benefit) recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $0.3 million, $0.2\nmillion, and $(0.5) million, respectively, is included in income tax expense in the Company’s consolidated\nstatements of income.\nFair Value Measurements. In general, fair value measurements are based upon quoted market prices, where\navailable. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value measurements are estimated using relevant market\ninformation and other assumptions. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and require some degree of judgment\nregarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments and other factors. The use of different assumptions or estimation\ntechniques may have a significant effect on the fair value amounts reported.\n(2) ACQUISITION\nGreat Western Bank. On September 15, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (“Agreement”) to\nacquire 100% of the outstanding stock of Great Western Bancorp, Inc. (“Great Western”), the parent company of\nGreat Western Bank (“GWB”), a Sioux Falls, South Dakota based community bank with 174 banking offices across\nArizona, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota (“GWB\nacquisition”). The GWB acquisition expanded the Company’s geographical footprint with an enhanced platform for\nfuture growth. Consideration for the acquisition was $1,723.3 million, consisting of the issuance of 46.9\nmillion shares of the Company’s Class A common stock valued at $36.76 per share, which was the opening price of\nthe Company’s Class A common stock as quoted on the NASDAQ stock market on the acquisition date. The\nacquisition was completed on February 1, 2022.\nThe Company accounted for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC\n805, Business Combinations, which requires purchased assets and liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged\nto be recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of estimated fair\nvalues required management to make certain estimates about discount rates, future expected cash flows, and market\nconditions at the time of the acquisition, as well as other future events that are highly subjective in nature.\nThe following table provides the purchase price allocation as of the acquisition date and the Great Western assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. We recorded the estimate of\nfair value based on valuations at the acquisition date. The excess value of the consideration paid over the fair value\nof assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill. The purchase price allocation resulted in\ngoodwill of $479.3 million, of which $31.7 million is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill resulting from\nthe acquisition was allocated to the Company’s one operating segment, community banking, and consists largely of\nthe synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of Great Western and the Company.\nAll amounts reported were finalized during the fourth quarter of 2022.\n86\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nAs of February 1, 2022\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 2,006.9\nInvestment securities 2,699.0\nSecurities purchased under agreement to resell 101.1\nLoans held for sale 217.0\nLoans held for investment 7,705.0\nAllowance for credit losses (59.5)\nPremises and equipment, including right of use lease assets 144.7\nOther real estate owned 15.8\nCompany owned life insurance 186.6\nCore deposit intangibles 50.1\nCustomer relationship intangible 22.8\nMortgage servicing rights 1.3\nDeferred tax assets, net 60.2\nOther assets 200.8\nTotal assets acquired 13,351.8\nLiabilities assumed:\nDeposits 11,688.0\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements 74.0\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities 110.4\nFHLB advances 122.9\nSubordinated debt 36.4\nSubordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts 76.1\nTotal liabilities assumed 12,107.8\nNet assets acquired $ 1,244.0\nConsideration paid:\nClass A common stock 1,723.3\nTotal consideration paid (1) $ 1,723.3\nGoodwill $ 479.3\n(1) Includes $13 thousand of cash paid in lieu of fractional shares.\nThe Company determined the fair value of loans, core deposit and customer relationship intangible assets,\ninvestment securities, premises and equipment, leases, mortgage servicing rights, deposits, FHLB advances,\nsubordinated debt, and subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts with the assistance of third-party valuation\nspecialists. The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and\nliabilities presented above.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these\nassets.\nInvestment Securities\nFair values for securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not\navailable, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar instruments,\nquoted market prices that are not in an active market or other inputs that are observable in the market. In the absence\nof observable inputs, fair value is estimated based on pricing models and/or discounted cash flow methodologies.\nLoans held for sale\nThe loans held for sale portfolio was recorded at fair value based on discounted payoffs and quotes or bids from\nthird party investors, or based on the terms of the loans, such as interest rate, maturity date, reset term, as well as\nsales, quotes, or bids of similar assets.\n87\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nLoans held for investment\nA valuation of the loans held for investment portfolio was performed by a third party as of the acquisition date in\naccordance with ASC 820 to assess the fair value of the loan portfolio, considering adjustments for interest rate risk,\nrequired equity return, servicing, credit, and liquidity risk. The loans held for investment portfolio was segmented\ninto two groups including purchase credit deteriorated (PCD) loans and non-PCD loans. The non-PCD loans were\npooled based on similar characteristics, such as loan type, fixed or adjustable interest rates, payment type, index rate\nand caps/floors, and non-accrual status. The PCD loans were valued at the loan level with similar characteristics\nnoted above. The fair value was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the\nloans using assumptions for the coupon rates, remaining maturities, prepayment speeds, projected default\nprobabilities, loss given defaults, and estimates of prevailing discount rates. The discount rate utilized to analyze fair\nvalue considered the cost of funds rate, capital charge, servicing costs, liquidity premium, and risk premium, mostly\nbased on industry standards. The discounted cash flow approach models the credit losses directly in the projected\ncash flows. The Company estimated the credit risks and principal losses of the loans using the Company’s\nassumptions of probability of default, loss given default, and foreclosures.\nThe Company is required to record PCD assets, defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality\nsince origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of\nacquisition. Under this method, there is no credit loss expense affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets.\nChanges in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized in subsequent periods as credit loss\nexpense (or reversal of credit loss expense) arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a\npool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration is allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition\ndate, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual assets to\nappropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment\nfor the allowance for credit losses, is accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective\ninterest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date. Information regarding loans\nacquired at the acquisition date as amended for measurement period adjustments as of December 31, 2022 were as\nfollows:\n(In millions)\nPCD loans:\nUnpaid principal balance $ 979.2\nPrincipal amounts previously written off by GWB (238.7)\nInterest applied to principal by GWB (18.1)\nAdjusted unpaid principal balance 722.4\nCredit discount (69.2)\nDiscount attributable to other factors (29.9)\nFair value 623.3\nAllowance for credit losses 59.5\nAmortized cost basis 682.8\nNon-PCD loans:\nUnpaid principal balance 7,107.9\nCredit discount (1) (76.5)\nNon-credit discount (9.2)\nFair value 7,022.2\nAmortized cost basis $ 7,705.0\n(1) Represents the best estimate of the contractual cash flows not expected to be collected as of the acquisition date.\nCore deposit intangible\nCore deposit intangible assets of $50.1 million on non-maturing deposits were determined by evaluating the\nunderlying characteristics of the deposit relationships, including customer attrition, deposit interest rates and\nmaintenance costs, and costs of alternative funding using the discounted cash flow approach. The core deposit\nintangibles represent the costs saved by the Company between maintaining the existing deposits and obtaining\nalternative funds over the life of the deposit base. These costs are amortized using an accelerated method over the\nestimated useful life of 10 years for the related deposits.\n88\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nCustomer relationship intangible\nCustomer relationship intangible assets of $22.8 million were determined using an excess earnings model associated\nwith the expected fee income related to the underlying client relationships and is being amortized using the straight-\nline method over the estimated useful life of 12 years.\nPremises and equipment\nThe fair values of premises are based on a market approach, using third-party appraisals and other analysis of value\nfor land and premises.\nDeposits\nThe fair values used for the demand and savings deposits equal the amounts payable on demand at the acquisition\ndate. In determining the fair value of certificates of deposit, the cash flows of the contractual interest payments\nduring the specific period of the certificates of deposit and scheduled principal payout were discounted to present\nvalue at market-based interest rates.\nFHLB advances\nThe fair value of fixed rate FHLB advances was determined using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flows\nof the advances were projected based on scheduled payments of the fixed rate advances, which factored in\nprepayment fees. The cash flows were then discounted to present value using the FHLB rates as of February 1, 2022.\nSubordinated debt and subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts\nThe fair value of subordinated debt and subordinated debentures held by subsidiary trusts was determined by using a\ndiscounted cash flow method using a market participant discount rate for similar instruments over the remaining\nterms.\nAcquisition related expenses related to the GWB acquisition of $118.9 million and $11.6 million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were included as a component of non-interest expense in the\nconsolidated statements of income, of which approximately $26.8 million and $9.0 million were acquisition related\ncosts as defined by ASC 805 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022, the Company contributed $21.5 million to the First Interstate Foundation and reimbursed an\naggregate of $8.2 million of the Scott family control group’s acquisition expenses pursuant to the Agreement.\nThe accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022, include the results of\noperations of the acquired entity from the February 1, 2022 acquisition date. The disclosure of GWB post-\nacquisition revenue and net income is not practical due to the combining of certain GWB operations with and into\nFIB as of the acquisition date. GWB was merged with our existing bank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank,\ncontemporaneously with the closing of the parent company merger. The core system conversion was completed on\nMay 23, 2022.\nThe following table presents certain pro forma financial information for the years ended December 31, 2022 and\n2021 as if GWB had been acquired on January 1, 2021. This pro forma information combines the historical results\nof GWB with the Company’s consolidated historical results and includes certain adjustments reflecting the estimated\nimpact of certain fair value adjustments for the respective periods. The pro forma information is not indicative of\nwhat would have occurred had the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the year prior to the acquisition. The pro\nforma information does not consider any changes to the provision for credit losses resulting from recording loan\nassets at fair value, cost savings, or business synergies. As a result, actual amounts would have differed from the pro\nforma information presented, and the differences could be significant.\nDecember 31, 2022 2021\nTotal revenues $ 1,223.3 $ 1,200.9\nNet income $ 351.6 $ 243.3\nEarnings per common share (Basic) $ 3.28 $ 2.24\nEarnings per common share (Diluted) $ 3.28 $ 2.24\n89\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

The quantitative assessment of\ngoodwill for the reporting unit was performed utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (“income approach”) and\nestimates of selected market information (“market approaches”). The income approach measures the fair value of an\ninterest in a business by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. The market approaches take into\nconsideration fair values of comparable companies operating in similar lines of business that are potentially subject\nto similar economic and environmental factors and could be considered reasonable investment alternatives. The\nresult of the income and market approaches were weighted in determining the fair value of the reporting unit.\nThere were no events or circumstances that occurred subsequent to October 31, 2023 through the reporting date that\nwould more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the Company’s reporting unit below its carrying value.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets are comprised of core deposit intangibles (“CDI”) and other customer relationship\nintangibles (“OCRI”) and amounted to the following at December 31, 2023 and 2022:\nDecember 31, 2023 CDI OCRI Total\nGross other intangible assets, at January 1, 2023 $ 154.7 $ 22.8 $ 177.5\nAccumulated amortization (92.5) (3.6) (96.1)\nNet other intangible assets, end of period $ 62.2 $ 19.2 $ 81.4\nDecember 31, 2022\nGross other intangible assets, at January 1, 2022 $ 106.0 $ — $ 106.0\nAmounts established through acquisition 50.1 22.8 72.9\nReductions due to sale of health savings accounts (1.4) — (1.4)\nAccumulated amortization (78.8) (1.7) (80.5)\nNet other intangible assets, end of period $ 75.9 $ 21.1 $ 97.0\nThe Company recorded $15.7 million, $15.9 million and $9.9 million of other intangible asset amortization expense\nfor the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively.\nCDI and OCRI are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment.

Such\nsecurities were evaluated and it was determined that there were no investment securities that met the definition of a\nPCD asset and none were classified as PCD upon acquisition.\nThe Company determines credit losses on both available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities by a\ndiscounted cash flow approach using the security’s effective interest rate at the time of purchase or upon acquisition.\nThe allowance for credit losses is measured as the amount by which an investment security’s amortized cost exceeds\nthe net present value of expected future cash flows. However, the amount of credit losses for available-for-sale\ninvestment securities is limited to the amount of a security’s unrealized loss. Credit losses on held-to-maturity\ninvestment securities are representative of current expected credit losses that management expects to be incurred\nover the life of the investment. The allowance for credit losses is established through a charge to provision for credit\nlosses in current period earnings.\nThe available-for-sale securities portfolio primarily contains securities that are guaranteed by a sovereign entity or\nare generally considered to have non-credit related risks, such as interest rate risk or prepayment and liquidity\nfactors. The Company considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies and\nwhether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had 995 and 1,222 individual investment securities, respectively,\nthat were in an unrealized loss position, which was related primarily to fluctuations in current interest rates.

The Company does not intend to sell any of the available-for-sale\nsecurities in the above table, and the Company does not anticipate it will have to sell any securities before a recovery\nin cost.\nThe following table presents the activity in the allowance for credit losses related to held-to-maturity investment\nsecurities:\nYear Ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021\nBeginning balance $ 1.9 $ — $ —\n(Reduction of) provision for credit losses (1.1) 1.9 —\nEnding balance $ 0.8 $ 1.9 $ —\nThe Company had no allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale corporate investment securities as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nModifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nModifications of loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis\nthrough negotiation with the borrower in connection with the ongoing loan collection processes. Loan modifications\nare made to provide borrowers payment relief. Effective January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02,\nwhich eliminated accounting guidance for troubled debt restructurings while requiring disclosures of borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty for modifications related to principal reductions, interest rate reductions, term\nextensions, and more than insignificant payment delay. See “Note 17 – Recent Authoritative Accounting Guidance”\nof these Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements” for further discussion of the amendments in this\nupdate.\nFrom time to time, we may modify certain loans to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. In some\ncases, these modifications may result in new loans. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty may be in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment\ndelay, or a term extension or a combination thereof, among other things.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of loans at December 31, 2023 that were both experiencing\nfinancial difficulty and modified during the year ended December 31, 2023, by class and by type of modification.\nThe percentage of the principal balance of loans that were modified to borrowers in financial difficulty as compared\nto the principal balance of each class of receivable is also presented below:\nTerm Extension % of Total Class of\nPrincipal Term Rate and Interest Loans Held for\nDecember 31, 2023 Forgiveness Extension Reduction Rate Reduction Total Investment (1)\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 1.5 $ 28.6 $ 1.1 $ 0.6 $ 31.8 0.36 %\nConstruction — 13.7 — — 13.7 0.75\nResidential 0.1 0.6 — — 0.7 0.03\nAgricultural — 6.4 — — 6.4 0.89\nTotal real estate 1.6 49.3 1.1 0.6 52.6 0.39\nConsumer:\nIndirect — 0.1 — — 0.1 0.01\nDirect and advance lines — 0.1 — — 0.1 0.07\nTotal consumer — 0.2 — — 0.2 0.02\nCommercial — 7.4 — 0.2 7.6 0.26\nAgricultural — 36.1 — — 36.1 4.69\nLoans held for investment (2) $ 1.6 $ 93.0 $ 1.1 $ 0.8 $ 96.5 0.53 %\n(1) Based on the principal balance as of period end, divided by the period end principal balance of the corresponding class of\nreceivables.\n(2) As of December 31, 2023, the Company excluded $1.6 million in accrued interest from the amortized cost of the identified\nloans.\nThe Company monitors the performance of loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to\nunderstand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. Of the loans that were modified during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023, there were $6.7 million of loans classified as past due 30 days or more, with the remaining\nloans performing in accordance with the modified terms and are classified as current at December 31, 2023.\nThere were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose terms\nhave been modified during the year ended December 31, 2023 through either principal forgiveness, interest rate\nreduction, term extension, or other than insignificant payment delay.\n101\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nThe following table presents the financial effect of the loan modifications presented above to borrowers\nexperiencing financial difficulty during the year ended December 31, 2023:\nTerm Extension and Interest Rate\nReduction\nWeighted-Average Weighted-Average Weighted-Average Weighted-Average\nPrincipal Months of Term Interest Rate Months of Term Interest Rate\nForgiveness Extension Reduction Extension Reduction\nReal estate:\nCommercial $ 1.3 5.8 0.35 % 6.0 0.25 %\nConstruction — 9.1 — 0.0 —\nResidential 0.3 131.6 — 0.0 —\nAgricultural — 4.5 — 0.0 —\nTotal real estate 1.6\nConsumer:\nIndirect — 8.3 — 0.0 —\nDirect and advance lines — 62.1 — 0.0 —\nTotal consumer —\nCommercial — 12.2 — 14.6 0.51\nAgricultural — 9.2 — 0.0 —\nLoans held for investment (1) $ 1.6\n(1) Balances based on loan original contractual terms.\nThere were no payment defaults on these loans subsequent to their modifications during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2023. The Company considers a payment default to occur when the loan is 90 days or more past due\nor the loan is placed on non-accrual status after the modification. The Company monitors the performance of\nmodified loans on an ongoing basis. In the event of subsequent default, the allowance for credit losses continues to\nbe reassessed on the basis of an individual evaluation of each loan. The modifications made during the periods\npresented did not significantly impact the Company’s determination of the allowance for credit losses.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Loans (“PCD”)\nThe Company analyzes all acquired loans at the time of acquisition for more-than-insignificant deterioration in\ncredit quality since their origination date. Such loans are classified as PCD, also referred to as PCD loans. Acquired\nloans classified as PCD are recorded at an initial amortized cost, which is comprised of the purchase price of the\nloans plus the initial allowance for credit losses for the loans, and any resulting discount or premium related to\nfactors other than credit. The Company accounts for interest income on PCD loans using the interest method,\nwhereby any purchase discounts or premiums are accreted or amortized into interest income as an adjustment of the\nloan’s yield.\nThe following table reconciles the par value, or initial amortized cost, of PCD loans acquired in the GWB\nacquisition as of February 1, 2022, or the date of the acquisition with the purchase price (or initial fair value of the\nloans) as amended for measurement period adjustments:\nPurchase price (initial fair value) $ 623.3\nAllowance for credit losses (1) 298.2\nDiscount attributable to other factors (2) 57.7\nPar value (unpaid principal balance) $ 979.2\n(1) For acquired PCD loans, an allowance of $298.2 million was required with a corresponding increase to the amortized cost\nbasis as of the acquisition date. For PCD loans where all or a portion of the loan balance had been previously written-off by\nGWB, or would be subject to write-off under the Company’s charge-off policy, a CECL allowance of $238.7 million, included\nas part of the grossed-up loan balance at acquisition was immediately written-off. The net impact to the allowance for PCD\nassets on the acquisition date was $59.5 million.\n(2) Non-credit discount includes the difference between the amortized cost basis and the unpaid principal balance of $39.6 million\nestablished on PCD loans acquired from GWB and interest applied to principal of $18.1 million.\n102\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nCredit Quality Indicators\nAs part of the on-going and continuous monitoring of the credit quality of the Company’s loan portfolio,\nmanagement tracks internally assigned risk classifications of loans based on relevant information about the ability of\nborrowers to service their debt. The factors considered by the Company include, among other factors, the borrower’s\ncurrent financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current\neconomic trends. The Company analyzes loans individually to classify the credit risk of the loans. This analysis\ngenerally includes loans with an outstanding balance greater than $1.0 million, which are generally considered non-\nhomogeneous loans, such as commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. This analysis is performed no less\nthan on an annual basis, depending upon the size of exposure and the contractual obligations governing the\nborrower’s financial reporting frequency. Homogeneous loans, including small business loans, are typically\nmonitored by payment performance. The Company internally risk rates its loans in accordance with a Uniform\nClassification System developed jointly by the various bank regulatory agencies. The Uniform Classification System\ndefines three broad categories of criticized assets, which the Company uses as credit quality indicators in addition to\nthe 6 Pass ratings in its 10-point rating scale:\nSpecial Mention — includes loans that exhibit a potential weakness in financial condition, loan structure, or\ndocumentation that warrants management’s close attention. If not promptly corrected, the potential weaknesses\nmay result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some\nfuture date.\nSubstandard — includes loans that are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the\nborrower which have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Although the primary\nsource of repayment for a substandard loan may not currently be sufficient, collateral or other sources of repayment\nare sufficient to satisfy the debt.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\n(10) DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The\nCompany principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through the\nmanagement of its business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and\ncredit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and derivative\nfinancial instruments. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap contracts\nto manage or hedge exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future\nknown and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates and interest rate exposures.\nThe Company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company sells residential mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis. The Company\nmitigates the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing interest rate lock commitments by entering into\nforward loan sales contracts. The forward loan sales contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value\nrecorded through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value component\nassociated with the projected cash flows from the loan delivery to the investor, the changes in fair value related to\nmovements in market rates of the interest rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally\nmove in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan\ncommitment period is generally inconsequential. When the loan is funded to the borrower, the interest rate lock\ncommitment derivative expires, and the Company records a loan held for sale. The forward loan sales contract acts\nas a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale. The changes in measurement of the\nestimated fair values of the interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales contracts are included in mortgage\nbanking revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).\nThe Company also enters into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments.\nThese derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a client\nwhile at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with a third-party financial institution. Because\nthe Company acts as an intermediary for the client, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts\nfor the most part offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company’s results of operations.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income (expense) and to\nmanage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses\ninterest rate swaps and collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy.\nAs part of the Company’s overall asset and liability management strategy, in August 2022 the Company entered into\ntwo interest rate collars related to variable-rate loans that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional\namount of $300.0 million. Each of the collars designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fixes the interest income\nreceived by the Company when the collar index falls below a floor rate on a rate reset during the term of the collar\nand when the collar index exceeds the cap rate on a rate reset during the term of the collar without exchange of the\nunderlying notional amount.\nIn October 2022, the Company entered into four swaps, two of which were related to variable-rate loans and two\nthat were related to variable-rate securities that were designated as cash flow hedges with a total notional amount of\n$850.0 million. Each of these swaps designated as cash flow hedges synthetically fixes the interest income received\nby the Company without exchange of the underlying notional amount.\nOf the six trades with a total notional amount of $1.15 billion, five are effective with a total notional of\n$900.0 million. Of these effective trades, the two collars and one swap are related to variable-rate loans and the other\ntwo swaps are related to variable-rate securities.\nFor derivatives that are designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the\nderivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into interest\nincome (expense) in the same period(s) during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in\naccumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified as interest income (expense)\nwhen interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate liabilities. During the next twelve months, based\non implied forward curves, the Company estimates that $9.1 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest\nexpense.\n109\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nFair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets due to changes in benchmark interest rates.\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to changes in fair value on these instruments\nattributable to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges\ninvolve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable-rate\npayments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. During the second\nquarter of 2022, the Company terminated the $500.0 million, two-year forward starting, three-year pay-fixed interest\nrate swap, resulting in a $23.3 million gain. The gain associated with the $500.0 million interest rate swap was to be\naccreted into income through May 2026. However, the U.S. Treasury securities associated with the swap were sold\nduring the fourth quarter of 2022. As such, the gain was accreted through August 2022 and then in September 2022\nthe remaining gain was recognized as income. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the\n$200.0 million, three-year forward starting, four-year pay fixed interest rate swap, resulting in a $8.5 million gain\nthat will be accreted into income through July 2028. The Company accreted $1.4 million of the gain into interest\nincome during the period ended December 31, 2023.\nFor derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the\noffsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in interest income.\nThe following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustment for\nfair value hedges for the periods indicated:\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022\nCarrying Amount of Cumulative Amount Carrying Amount of Cumulative Amount\nthe Hedged Assets/ of Fair Value the Hedged Assets/ of Fair Value\n(Liabilities) Hedging Adjustment (Liabilities) Hedging Adjustment\nAvailable-for-sale securities $ 193.3 $ 6.7 $ 191.9 $ 8.1\nNon-designated Hedge Derivatives\nDerivatives not designated as accounting hedges are not speculative and result from a service the Company provides\nto certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate\ntheir respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting\nderivatives that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure\nresulting from such transactions. As the interest rate derivatives associated with this program do not meet the strict\nhedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer derivatives and the offsetting\nderivatives are recognized directly in earnings.\nRisk Participation Agreements\nThe Company acquired from GWB risk participation agreements under which it assumes credit risk associated with\na borrower’s performance related to derivative contracts. The Company only entered into these credit risk\nparticipation agreements in instances in which the Company was also a party to the related loan participation\nagreements for such borrowers. The Company manages its credit risk under risk participation agreements by\nmonitoring the creditworthiness of the borrower, based on its normal credit review process.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis for the periods\nindicated. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of\nbilateral collateral and master netting agreements, but after the variation margin payments with central clearing\norganizations have been applied as settlement, as applicable. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to\naccount for the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts\nwith a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral.\nSecurities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the consolidated balance\nsheets.\n110\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain\nmandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct\nmaterial effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the\nregulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines\nthat involve quantitative measures of the Company’s and Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet\nitems as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Parent Company, like all bank holding companies, is\nnot subject to the prompt corrective action provisions. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and\nclassification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other\nfactors.\nQuantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company to maintain\nminimum amounts and ratios of total and tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and of tier 1 capital to average assets,\nas defined in the regulations. As of December 31, 2023, the Company exceeded all capital adequacy requirements to\nwhich it is subject.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the most recent notification from the regulatory agencies categorized the Bank as well\ncapitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well-capitalized, the\ninstitution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the\nfollowing table. There are no conditions or events since the most recent notification that management believes have\nchanged the Bank's categories.\nAs an approved mortgage seller, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of capital specified by the United\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nIn connection with the adoption of CECL, or ASC 326, on January 1, 2020, the Company recognized an after-tax\ncumulative effect reduction to retained earnings totaling $24.1 million. In March 2020, the Office of the Comptroller\nof Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC issued an interim final rule that\nallows banking organizations to mitigate the effects of ASC 326 on their regulatory capital computations. This\ninterim rule is in addition to the three-year transition period already in place under the capital transition rule\npreviously issued in February 2019. Banking organizations can elect to mitigate the estimated cumulative regulatory\ncapital effects for an additional two years. This rule allows an institution to defer incorporating the impact of ASC\n326 into its regulatory capital calculation, including ratios, over an extended period. Additionally, the interim rule\nextends the transition period whereby an institution can defer the impact from ASC 326 on the current period,\ndetermined based on the difference between the new ASC 326 allowance for credit losses and the allowance for loan\nlosses under the incurred loss method from previous GAAP, for up to two years. The total impact related to ASC\n326 would then be transitioned into regulatory capital and the associated ratios over a three-year transition period,\nbeginning after the initial two-year deferral period, for a total transition period of five years. The Company elected\nto opt into the transition election and adopted transition relief over the permissible five-year period.\n(18) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company had commitments under construction contracts of $4.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe Parent Company and the Billings office of FIB are the anchor tenants in a building owned by an entity in which\nFIB has a 50.0% ownership interest.\nThe Company leases certain premises and equipment from third parties under operating leases. Total rental expense\nto third parties was $9.3 million, $8.9 million, and $4.3 million, in 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe total future minimum rental commitments, exclusive of maintenance and operating costs, required under\noperating leases that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year at December 31,\n2023, are as follows:\nThird Parties Related Entity Total\nFor the year ending December 31:\n2024 $ 10.2 $ 1.4 $ 11.6\n2025 8.5 1.4 9.9\n2026 7.2 0.9 8.1\n2027 5.4 0.1 5.5\n2028 4.2 — 4.2\nThereafter 11.3 — 11.3\nTotal $ 46.8 $ 3.8 $ 50.6\nResidential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market are sold with varying recourse provisions.\nEssentially all the loan sales agreements require the repurchase of a mortgage loan by the seller in situations such as\nbreach of representation, warranty, or covenant; untimely document delivery; false or misleading statements; failure\nto obtain certain certificates or insurance; or unmarketability. Certain loan sales agreements contain repurchase\nrequirements based on payment-related defects that are defined in terms of the number of days or months since the\npurchase, the sequence number of the payment, and/or the number of days of payment delinquency. Based on the\nspecific terms stated in the agreements, the Company had $0.8 million and $0.9 million of sold residential mortgage\nloans with recourse provisions still in effect as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company did not repurchase a significant amount of loans from secondary market investors under the terms of\nloan sales agreements during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. In the opinion of management,\nthe risk of recourse and the subsequent requirement of loan repurchase to the Company is not significant, and\naccordingly no liabilities have been established related to such. In addition, the Company made various\nrepresentations and warranties associated with the sale of loans. The Company has not incurred significant losses\nresulting from these provisions.\n122\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nA substantial portion of the Company’s clients’ ability to honor their contracts is dependent on the economy in\nArizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oregon, South\nDakota, Washington, and Wyoming. The Company’s loan portfolio is diversified and assigned to risk classifications\nby industry concentrations and the current economic conditions. These industry concentrations of credit are taken\ninto consideration by management in determining the allowance for credit losses.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation. In the opinion of\nmanagement, following consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate liability or disposition thereof is not expected\nto have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity of the\nCompany.\n(19) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk to meet\nthe financing needs of its clients. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby\nletters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of\namounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a\nclient so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contract. Since many of the\ncommitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily\nrepresent future cash requirements. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to\nguarantee the performance of a client to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is\nessentially the same as the credit risk involved in extending loan facilities to clients.

The federal net operating losses will expire beginning in 2030 and\nending in 2036 and the state net operating losses will expire beginning in 2023 and ending in 2036. The use of these\ncarryforwards is subject to annual limitations.\nThe Company had current net income tax receivables of $16.4 million and $38.3 million at December 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively.\nGAAP requires the measurement of unrecorded tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions. An unrecorded tax\nbenefit is the difference between the tax benefit of a position taken, or expected to be taken, on a tax return and the\nbenefit recorded for accounting purposes. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had no unrecorded tax\nbenefits and does not expect this position to significantly change within the next 12 months.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and also in various states. The Company is no\nlonger subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2020.\n(21) STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has equity awards outstanding under two stock-based compensation plans; The 2023 Equity and\nIncentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) and the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2015 Plan”).\nThese plans were primarily established to enhance the Company’s ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors or, upon delegation, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee of the\nBoard of Directors (“Compensation Human Capital Committee”) has exclusive authority to select employees,\nadvisors and others, including directors, to receive awards and to establish the terms and conditions of each award\nmade pursuant to the Company’s stock-based compensation plan.\nThe 2023 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2023, was established to provide the Company\nwith flexibility to select from various equity-based performance compensation methods, and to be able to address\nchanging accounting and tax rules and corporate governance practices by optimally utilizing performance based\ncompensation. The 2023 Plan did not increase the number of shares of the common stock available for awards under\nthe 2015 Plan. At December 31, 2023, there were 1,389,724 common shares available for future grant under the\n2023 Plan.\nThe 2015 Plan, approved by the Company’s shareholders in May 2015, was established to provide the Company\nwith flexibility to select from various equity-based performance compensation methods, and to be able to address\nchanging accounting and tax rules and corporate governance practices by optimally utilizing performance based\ncompensation. Upon approval of the 2023 Plan, the remaining common shares available for future grant under the\n2015 were forfeited. The 2015 Plan continues with respect to the awards made prior to June 2023.\n125\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nRestricted Stock Awards. Common stock issued under the Company’s restricted stock plan may not be sold or\notherwise transferred until restrictions have lapsed or performance objectives have been obtained. During the vesting\nperiods, participants have voting rights and receive dividends on all time restricted shares and vesting performance\nrestricted shares under the 2015 Plan. During the vesting periods, under the 2023 Plan, participants do not have\nvoting rights and dividends are accumulated until the time upon which the award vests. Upon termination of\nemployment, common shares upon which restrictions have not lapsed must be returned to the Company.\nAll restricted share awards are classified as equity awards. The fair value of equity-classified restricted stock awards\nis based on the market price of the stock on the measurement date and is amortized as compensation expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the period restrictions lapse or performance goals are met. Stock compensation is recognized\nbased on the number of awards to vest using actual forfeiture amounts. For performance-based stock awards, an\nestimate is made of the number of shares expected to vest as a result of actual performance against the performance\ntargets to determine the amount of compensation expense to be recognized. The estimate is reevaluated quarterly and\ntotal compensation expense is adjusted for any change in the current period.\nStock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards of $4.7 million, $9.6 million and $8.9 million\nwas included in employee benefits on the Company’s consolidated statements of income for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Related income tax expense of $0.4 million and $0.3 million for\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and related income tax benefit of $0.3 million was\nrecognized for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe following table presents information regarding the Company’s restricted stock:\nWeighted-Average\nNumber of Measurement Date\nAs of December 31, 2023 Shares Fair Value\nRestricted stock, beginning of year 741,098 $ 38.94\nGranted 683,574 19.84\nVested (180,587) 36.73\nForfeited (127,779) 29.75\nRestricted stock, end of year 1,116,306 $ 27.74\nDuring 2023, the Company issued 683,574 restricted common shares. The 2023 restricted share awards included\n363,440 performance restricted shares, of which 181,720 vest in varying percentages upon achievement of defined\nreturn on average equity performance goals, and 181,720 vest in varying percentages upon achievement of defined\ntotal return to shareholder goals. The defined return to shareholder goals related to the 2020 performance restricted\nstock grants were not met resulting in the cancellation of 86,802 performance shares. Vesting of the 2023\nperformance restricted shares is also contingent on employment as of March 15, 2026. Additionally, 406,936 time-\nrestricted shares were issued during 2023, of which 54,414 vest one year from the grant date, 97,665 vest two years\nfrom the grant date, and the remaining 254,857 vest one-third on each annual anniversary of the grant date,\ncontingent on continued employment through the vesting dates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there was $22.2 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested,\nrestricted stock awards expected to be recognized over a period of 1.35 years.\n(22) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN\nSavings Plan. In addition, the Company has a contributory employee savings plan. All employees are eligible to\nparticipate in the plan. Employee participation in the plan is at the option of the employee. The Company\ncontributed 100% of the first 6% of the participating employee’s eligible compensation in 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. Contribution expense for this plan of $12.7 million, $13.5 million, and $8.8 million in 2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively, is included in employee benefits expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.\n126\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

There is a fair value hierarchy which requires an\nentity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair\nvalue.\nThe three levels of inputs to measure fair value are as follows:\n• Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n• Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities;\nquoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities\n• Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the\nfair value of assets or liabilities\nThe methodologies used by the Company in determining the fair values of each class of financial instruments are\nbased primarily on independent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date, and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the\nvaluation hierarchy. There have been no significant changes in the valuation techniques during the periods ended\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels as of the end of the reporting period. Transfers in and\nout of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 are recognized on the actual transfer date. There were no significant transfers\nbetween fair value hierarchy levels during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Further details on the\nmethods used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments above are discussed below:\nInvestment Debt Securities Available-for-Sale. The Company obtains fair value measurements for investment\nsecurities from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may\ninclude dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution\ndata, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the investment’s terms and conditions, among\nothers. Vendors chosen by the Company are widely recognized vendors whose evaluations support the pricing\nfunctions of financial institutions, investment and mutual funds, and portfolio managers. If needed, a broker may be\nutilized to determine the reported fair value of investment securities.\nLoans Held for Sale. Fair value measurements for residential mortgage loans held for sale are obtained from an\nindependent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include binding\ncontracts or quotes or bids from third party investors as well as loan level pricing adjustments. Commercial and\nagricultural loans held for sale are derived from quotes or bids from third party investors.\n129\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nInterest Rate Collars: The fair values of interest rate collars are obtained from an independent third party. The\nvalues are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that\nwould occur if variable interest rates fell below (rise above) the strike rate of the floors (caps). The variable interest\nrates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the collars are based on an expectation of future interest rates\nderived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities. The change in the value of derivative assets\nattributable to basis risk, or the risk that offsetting investments in a hedging strategy will not experience price\nchanges in entirely opposite directions, was not significant in the reported periods. The Company also compares the\nreasonableness of the pricing semi-annually through a validation process involving additional independent third\nparties.\nInterest Rate Swap Contracts. Fair values for derivative interest rate swap contracts are obtained from an\nindependent third party. The values are based upon the estimated amounts to settle the contracts considering current\ninterest rates and are calculated using discounted cash flows that are observable, or that can be corroborated by\nobservable market data. The inputs used to determine fair value include the United States Dollar – SOFR forward\ncurve to estimate variable rate cash inflows and the SOFR to estimate the discount rate. The estimated variable rate\ncash inflows are compared to the fixed rate outflows and such difference is discounted to a present value to estimate\nthe fair value of the interest rate swaps. The change in the value of derivative assets attributable to basis risk, or the\nrisk that offsetting investments in a hedging strategy will not experience price changes in entirely opposite\ndirections, was not significant in the reported periods. The Company also compares the reasonableness of the pricing\nsemi-annually through a validation process involving additional independent third parties.\nFor purposes of potential valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, we evaluate both our credit risk and the\ncredit risk of our counterparties. Accordingly, we have considered factors such as the likelihood of our default and\nthe default of our counterparties, our net exposures and remaining contractual life, among other things, in\ndetermining if any fair value adjustments related to credit risk are required. The change in value of derivative assets\nand derivative liabilities attributable to credit risk was not significant during the reported periods.\nInterest Rate Lock Commitments. Fair value measurements for interest rate lock commitments are obtained from an\nindependent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include prices available\nfrom secondary market investors taking into consideration various characteristics of the loan, including the loan\namount, interest rate, value of the servicing, and loan to value ratio, among other things. Observable data is then\nadjusted to reflect changes in interest rates, the Company’s estimated pull-through rate, and estimated direct costs\nnecessary to complete the commitment into a closed loan net of origination and processing fees collected from the\nborrower.\nForward Loan Sales Contracts. The fair value measurements for forward loan sales contracts are obtained from an\nindependent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that includes sales of similar\nloans.\nDeferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities. The fair values of deferred compensation plan assets and\nliabilities are based primarily on the use of independent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be\nreasonably expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. These\ninvestments are in the same funds and purchased in the same amounts as the participants’ selected investments,\nwhich represent the underlying liabilities to plan participants. Deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at\namounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants’ selected investments.\n130\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nCollateral-dependent Loans. Collateral-dependent loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if\nrepayment is expected solely from collateral. The collateral-dependent loans are reported at fair value through\nspecific valuation allowance allocations. In addition, when it is determined that the fair value of a collateral-\ndependent loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the carrying value of the loan is adjusted to fair\nvalue through a charge to the allowance for credit losses. Collateral values are estimated using independent\nappraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31,\n2022, the Company had collateral-dependent loans with a carrying and fair value of $52.6 million and $39.1 million,\nrespectively.\nLoans Held for Sale. Fair value measurements for non-residential mortgage loans held for sale are derived from\nvaluations, appraisals, and quotes or bids from third party investors. The fair value measurements consider\nobservable data that may include binding contracts or quotes or bids from third party investors as well as loan level\npricing adjustments.\nOREO. The fair values of OREO are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current\nmarket conditions. Upon initial recognition, write-downs based on the foreclosed asset’s fair value at foreclosure are\nreported through charges to the allowance for credit losses. Periodically, the fair value of foreclosed assets is\nremeasured with any subsequent write-downs charged to OREO expense in the period in which they are identified.\nLong-lived Assets to be Disposed of by Sale. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are carried at the lower of\ncarrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. The fair values of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale\nare based upon observable market data and management estimates of current market conditions. As of December 31,\n2023, the Company had long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale with carrying and fair values aggregating $1.0\nmillion. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale with carrying values\naggregating $5.7 million, reduced by write-downs of $0.2 million charged to other expense, and fair values\naggregating $5.5 million\nThe following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis and for which the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair values:\nAs of December 31, 2023 Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Range (Weighted Average)\nCollateral-dependent loans $ 52.6 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment —% - 100% (36%)\nDiscount for type of\nFair value of property, age of appraisal,\nLoans held for sale 46.9 collateral and current status 5% - 23% (14)%\nOther real estate owned 16.5 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 10% - 43% (48)%\nLong-lived assets to be disposed\nof by sale 1.0 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment —% - —% —%\nAs of December 31, 2022\nCollateral-dependent loans $ 39.1 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 0% - 45% (7%)\nDiscount for type of\nFair value of property, age of appraisal,\nLoans held for sale 67.5 collateral and current status 11% 23% (17%)\nOther real estate owned 12.7 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 15% - 36% (22%)\nLong-lived assets to be disposed\nof by sale 5.5 Appraisal Appraisal adjustment 0% - 6% (3%)\nThe Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate fair\nvalue. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a\nrecurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of other\nfinancial instruments are discussed below. For financial instruments bearing a variable interest rate where no credit\nrisk exists, it is presumed that recorded book values are reasonable estimates of fair value.\n133\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Dollars in millions, except share and per share data)\nFinancial Assets. Carrying values of cash, cash equivalents, and accrued interest receivable approximate fair values\ndue to the liquid and/or short-term nature of these instruments. Fair values for investment securities held-to-maturity\nare obtained from an independent pricing service, which considers observable data that may include dealer quotes,\nmarket spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market\nconsensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and the investment’s terms and conditions, among other things.\nFair values of fixed rate loans and variable rate loans that reprice on an infrequent basis are estimated by discounting\nfuture cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers\nof similar credit quality using an exit price notion. Carrying values of variable rate loans that reprice frequently, and\nwith no change in credit risk, approximate the fair values of these instruments.\nFinancial Liabilities. The fair values of demand deposits, savings accounts, securities sold under repurchase\nagreements, and accrued interest payable are the amounts that are payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair\nvalues of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using external market rates that are currently offered for\ndeposits that have similar remaining maturities. The fair values of derivative liabilities are obtained from an\nindependent pricing service, which considers observable data that may include the United States Dollar - SOFR\nforward curve, the federal funds effective swap rate and cash flows, among other things. The fixed and floating rate\nsubordinated debentures, floating rate subordinated term loan, other borrowed funds, fixed rate subordinated term\ndebt, and capital lease obligation are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates for advances that\nhave similar characteristics.\nCommitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit. The fair value of commitments to extend credit and\nstandby letters of credit, based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, is not significant.\n134\nTable of Contents\nFIRST INTERSTATE BANCSYSTEM, INC.

These\nparties were deposit clients of the Bank and incurred indebtedness in the form of loans, as clients, of $11.1 million\nand $18.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2023, new loans and advances on existing\nloans of $5.8 million were funded, loan repayments totaled $6.1 million, and $7.5 million of loans were removed or\nadded due to changes in related parties. All deposit and loan transactions were made on substantially the same terms,\nincluding interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not\nrelated to the Company and do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable\nfeatures.\nOn December 14, 2023, the Company completed the repurchase of one million shares of its common stock from the\nestate of the Homer Scott, Jr. Revocable Trust (the “Trust”) at a price of $32.14 per share, or the closing price per\nshare of the common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market on December 14, 2023, representing an\naggregate purchase price of $32.1 million.

For transactions that are\nmodified because of reference rate reform and that meet certain scope guidance (i) modifications of loan agreements\nshould be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate, with such modification considered to\nbe \"minor\" so that any existing unamortized origination fees/costs will carry forward and continue to be amortized\nand (ii) modifications of lease agreements should be accounted for as a continuation of the existing agreement with\nno reassessments of the lease classification and the discount rate or remeasurements of lease payments that\notherwise would be required for modifications will not be accounted for as separate contracts. ASU 2020-04 is\neffective March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply ASU 2020-04 for contract\nmodifications as of January 1, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is\nsubsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected\nfor a Topic or an Industry Subtopic within the Codification, the amendments in this ASU must be applied\nprospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. The Company adopted\ncertain elections related to cash flow hedges which did not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial\nposition or results of operations. Based upon the amendments provided in ASU 2022-06 discussed below, ASU\n2020-04 can generally be applied through December 31, 2024.\nASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)” In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference\nRate Reform Topic 848, that clarifies certain exceptions that are optional in Topic 848 for contract modifications and\nhedge accounting and apply those exceptions to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. An entity\nmay elect to apply the amendments in this ASU on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an\ninterim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from\nany date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final ASU. If an\nentity elects to apply any of the amendments in this ASU for an eligible hedging relationship, any adjustments as a\nresult of those elections must be reflected as of the date the entity applies the election. The amendments in this ASU\ndo not apply to contract modifications made, new hedging relationships entered into, or existing hedging\nrelationships evaluated for effectiveness in periods after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships\nexisting as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain exceptions that are optional in which the accounting effects of\nthe hedging activity are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. The Company is currently evaluating\nthe impact of the standard and does not anticipate it will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial\nposition or results of operations. Based upon the amendments provided in ASU 2022-06 discussed below, ASU\n2021-01 can generally be applied through December 31, 2024.\nASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities\nfrom Contracts with Customers” In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations Topic\n805, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, to address diversity in\npractice and inconsistency related to the accounting for revenue contracts with customers acquired in a business\ncombination. The amendments require that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities\nacquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. The\namendments also provide certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired\ncontract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination and applies to contract\nassets and contract liabilities from other contracts to which the provisions of Topic 606 apply. The amendments are\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years.

The amendments allow nonprepayable financial\nassets also to be included in a closed portfolio hedged using the portfolio layer method. That expanded scope\npermits an entity to apply the same portfolio hedging method to both prepayable and nonprepayable financial assets,\nthereby allowing consistent accounting for similar hedges.

Rather than applying the recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, an entity must apply the loan\nrefinancing and restructuring guidance to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation\nof an existing loan. The amendment also requires an entity disclose current-period gross writeoffs by year of\norigination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326. The\namendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those\nfiscal years.

Previously, this method was only available for\nqualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. The amendments also require that a\nreporting entity disclose certain information in annual and interim reporting periods that enable investors to\nunderstand certain information about its investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits\nfrom a tax credit program. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

(\"FIBK\") Class A common stock\nissued in exchange for the outstanding common stock of Cascade Bancorp (\"CACB\") as a result of the merger of CACB\nwith and into FIBK on May 30, 2017.\nForm 8937 Part II, Box 14:\nThe reportable organizational action involves the merger of CACB with and into FIBK on May 30, 2017. As a result of\nthis merger, each share of CACB common stock was exchanged for 0.14864 shares of FIBK Class A common stock\nand $1.91 in cash. To the extent that the exchange would have resulted in the issuance of a fractional share of FIBK\nClass A common stock to a CACB shareholder, a cash payment equal to the market value equivalent of the fractional\nshare was paid in lieu of issuing a fractional share of FIBK Class A common stock.\nForm 8937 Part II, Box 15:\nThe merger of CACB with and into FIBK qualifies as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result, each CACB shareholder will recognize a taxable gain,\nbut not a loss, equal to the lesser of:\n• The amount of cash received in the exchange; or\n• The amount, if any, by which the sum of the cash received plus the fair market value of the shares\nof FIBK Class A common stock received in the exchange (measured at the time of the exchange)\nexceeds the CACB shareholder's tax basis in the CACB shares surrendered in the exchange.\nFor purposes of calculating this taxable gain, the amount of cash received in the exchange does not include cash\nreceived in lieu of fractional shares of FIBK Class A common stock (see discussion of cash received in lieu of fractional\nshares below).\nGain or loss must be calculated separately for each identifiable block of CACB common shares surrendered in the\nexchange having a common tax basis. A loss realized on one block of CACB common shares may not be used to offset\na gain realized on another block of CACB common shares. Each CACB shareholder is encouraged to consult their own\npersonal tax advisor regarding the determination of this realized gain or loss on the exchange.\nEach CACB shareholder is required to determine the tax basis of the shares of FIBK Class A common stock received\nin the exchange by performing the following calculations separately for each identifiable block of CACB common shares\nsurrendered in the exchange having a common tax basis:\n• Begin with the aggregate tax basis of the CACB common shares surrendered in the exchange\n• Add the amount of taxable gain, if any, determined from the above calculation (excluding any gain\nor loss resulting from the deemed receipt and sale of fractional shares described below)\n• Subtract the total amount of cash received (excluding any cash received in lieu of fractional shares\ndescribed below)\n• Subtract the tax basis in any fractional shares of FIBK Class A common stock that were deemed to\nhave been received in the exchange and immediately sold (see the treatment of fractional shares\ndescribed below)\nThe resulting figure represents the aggregate tax basis of the shares of FIBK Class A common stock received\nin the exchange for that identifiable block of CACB common shares transferred. The tax basis of each\nindividual share of FIBK Class A common stock within this identifiable block is determined by dividing this\naggregate tax basis by the number of FIBK common shares that comprise this identifiable block.\nCACB shareholders who receive cash in lieu of a fractional share of FIBK Class A common stock are, for\npurposes of determining the taxability of that cash, deemed to have received the fractional share in the\nexchange and then as having sold the fractional share for cash. These CACB shareholders will generally\nrecognize a taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between the tax basis of the CACB common shares\ndeemed to have been exchanged for the fractional share and the amount of cash received.\nForm 8937 Part II, Box 16:\nRefer to the description of the basis calculation in Part II, Box 15 above. The May 30, 2017 closing price of\na single share of FIBK Class A common stock on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange was $34.30."
