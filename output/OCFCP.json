ROTCE also excludes preferred stock from stockholders’ equity. Refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” “Selected Quarterly Financial Data” and “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” tables for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nCore earnings1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were $23.2 million and $71.5 million, respectively, or $0.39 and $1.22 per diluted share, an increase from $18.6 million or $0.32 per diluted share and a decrease from $78.4 million or $1.33 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year periods, and an increase from $22.7 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the prior linked quarter.\n\nCore earnings PTPP1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $30.9 million and $99.8 million, respectively, or $0.53 and $1.71 per diluted share, as compared to $35.0 million and $118.7 million, or $0.59 and $2.01 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year periods, and $32.7 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, for the prior linked quarter.

Non-performing loans decreased by $5.3 million, to $28.1 million, and the Company recorded net loan recoveries of $88,000 for the quarter.\n\n\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Maher, commented on the Company’s results, “We are pleased to present our current quarter results, which builds on the existing strength of our balance sheet, including robust capital and asset quality, coupled with stabilization of net interest income and margin. The quarter includes additional investments in mortgage banking activities, which will expand our digital channels and fee revenue and, in October, we completed an acquisition of a specialty finance company expanding our product offerings.” Mr. Maher added, “Additionally, the Company hosted its third annual CommUNITYFirst Day. Thank you to our incredible employees and community partners for a successful event involving over 700 employees and nearly 3,000 hours across our communities.”\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared its 111th consecutive quarterly cash dividend on common stock. The quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.20 per share will be paid on November 15, 2024 to common stockholders of record on November 4, 2024.

This dividend will be paid on November 15, 2024 to preferred stockholders of record on October 31, 2024.\n\n1 Core earnings and core earnings before income taxes and provision for credit losses (“PTPP” or “Pre-Tax-Pre-Provision”), and ratios derived therefrom, are non-GAAP financial measures. For the periods presented, core earnings exclude merger related expenses, net branch consolidation expense, net (gain) loss on equity investments, net loss on sale of investments, net gain on sale of trust business, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment, and the income tax effect of these items, (collectively referred to as “non-core” operations). PTPP excludes the aforementioned pre-tax “non-core” items along with income tax expense (benefit) and provision for credit losses. Refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” “Selected Quarterly Financial Data” and the “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” tables for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures.\n\n2 The talent acquisition of Garden State Home Loans, Inc. was effective August 3, 2024. Additionally, the acquisition of Spring Garden Capital Group, LLC was effective October 1, 2024. \n\n**Results of Operations** The current quarter was impacted by a continued mix-shift and repricing of funding costs. Further, the results were impacted by the following non-recurring events: $1.7 million of merger related expenses, a $1.4 million gain on sale of a portion of the Company’s trust business, a $855,000 gain on sale of assets held for sale, and the resolution, via sale of collateral, of a single commercial real estate relationship of $7.2 million that was moved to non-accrual and partially charged-off in prior periods.\n\n**Net Interest Income and Margin**\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__September 30, 2023_\n\nNet interest income decreased to $82.2 million, from $91.0 million, primarily reflecting the net impact of the higher interest rate environment.\n\nNet interest margin decreased to 2.67%, from 2.91%, which included the impact of purchase accounting accretion of 0.02% and 0.06%, respectively. Net interest margin decreased primarily due to the increase in cost of funds outpacing the increase in yield on average interest-earning assets.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets decreased by $152.1 million due to balance sheet contraction while the average yield for interest-earning assets increased to 5.26%, from 5.08%.\n\nThe cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.20%, from 2.71%, primarily due to higher cost of deposits. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) increased to 2.44%, from 1.99%. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased by $5.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in total deposits, largely offset by an increase in total borrowings.\n\n_Nine months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__September 30, 2023_\n\nNet interest income decreased to $250.7 million, from $281.9 million, reflecting the net impact of the higher interest rate environment. Net interest margin decreased to 2.73%, from 3.09%, which included the impact of purchase accounting accretion and prepayment fees of 0.04% and 0.05% for the respective periods.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets increased by $45.8 million, primarily driven by an increase in securities growth of $153.9 million, which was funded through the decrease of $135.4 million of interest-earning deposits and short-term investments. The average yield increased to 5.25%, from 4.90%.\n\nThe total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.12%, from 2.29%. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) increased to 2.37%, from 1.48%. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $258.0 million, primarily due to an increase in total deposits, partly offset by a decrease in total borrowings.\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__June 30, 2024_\n\nNet interest income decreased by $44,000, as the increase in cost of deposits slightly outpaced the decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advance costs and the yield of average interest earning assets. Net interest margin decreased to 2.67%, from 2.71%, which included the impact of purchase accounting accretion of 0.02% and 0.04% for the respective periods.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets increased by $28.9 million, primarily due to an increase in interest-earning deposits and short-term investments, partly offset by a decrease in loans. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 5.26%, from 5.25%.\n\nThe total cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.20%, from 3.14%, primarily due to higher cost of deposits. Total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) increased to 2.44%, from 2.37%. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased by $1.8 million, primarily due to an increase in FHLB advances, partly offset by a decrease in deposits and other borrowings.\n\n**Provision for Credit Losses** Provision for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $517,000 and $4.2 million, respectively, as compared to $10.3 million and $14.5 million for the corresponding prior year periods, and $3.1 million in the prior linked quarter. The lower provision for the current quarter was a result of flat loan growth, net loan recoveries, and the net effect of shifts in the Company’s loan portfolio and external macro economic forecasts.\n\nNet loan recoveries were $88,000 and net loan charge-offs were $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $8.3 million for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net loan charge-offs were $1.5 million in the prior linked quarter. The prior year periods and prior linked quarter included partial charge-offs of $8.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the single commercial real estate relationship disclosed previously. Refer to “Results of Operations” section for further discussion.\n\n**Non-interest Income**\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__September 30, 2023_\n\nOther income increased to $14.7 million, as compared to $10.8 million. Other income was favorably impacted by non-core operations related to net gains on equity investments of $1.4 million and $1.5 million, for the respective quarters, and a $1.4 million gain on sale of a portion of the Company’s trust business in the current quarter.\n\nExcluding non-core operations, other income increased by $2.5 million, primarily driven by increases in fees and service charges of $918,000 related to treasury management fees, a non-recurring gain on sale of assets held for sale of $855,000, and net gain on sale of loans of $439,000.\n\n_Nine months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__September 30, 2023_\n\nOther income increased to $38.0 million, as compared to $21.8 million. The current period was favorably impacted by non-core operations related to net gains on equity investments of $4.2 million and a $2.6 million gain on sale of a portion of the Company’s trust business. The prior year was adversely impacted by non-core operations of $6.6 million, primarily related to losses on sale of investments.\n\nExcluding non-core operations, other income increased by $2.8 million, primarily driven by increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance of $1.5 million, which included one-time death benefits in the current period, net gain on sale of loans of $1.2 million, and gain on sale of assets held for sale of $855,000. This was partially offset by a decrease in trust and asset management revenue of $590,000, related to the sale of a portion of the Company’s trust business.\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__June 30, 2024_\n\nOther income in the prior linked quarter was $11.0 million and was favorably impacted by non-core operations of $887,000 related to net gains on equity investments. Excluding non-core operations, other income increased by $1.7 million, primarily due increases in fees and service charges of $1.1 million related to treasury management fees, and the gain on sale of assets held for sale of $855,000, as noted above.\n\n**Non-interest Expense**\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__September 30, 2023_\n\nOperating expenses decreased to $63.7 million, as compared to $64.5 million. Operating expenses were adversely impacted by non-core operations related to merger related expenses of $1.7 million in the current quarter.\n\nExcluding non-core operations, operating expenses decreased by $2.4 million. The primary driver was a decrease in professional fees of $3.3 million as the Company realized benefits from the performance improvement initiatives and investments made in the prior periods. This was partially offset by an increase in other operating expense of $1.1 million, which was partly due to additional loan servicing expenses.\n\n_Nine months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__September 30, 2023_\n\nOperating expenses decreased to $181.0 million, as compared to $188.7 million. Operating expenses were adversely impacted by $2.1 million in the current year of non-core operations related to merger related expenses and a FDIC special assessment, and by $92,000 in the prior year for merger related and net branch consolidation expenses.\n\nExcluding non-core operations, operating expenses decreased by $9.7 million. The primary drivers were decreases in professional fees of $8.6 million and compensation and employee benefits expenses of $1.9 million, which were due to the same initiatives discussed in the three-month periods above. This was partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses of $1.3 million, which was partly due to additional loan servicing expenses.\n\n_Three months ended September 30, 2024_ _vs.__June 30, 2024_\n\nExcluding non-core operations, operating expenses increased by $3.4 million. The primary drivers were increases in compensation and benefits of $2.7 million, related to additional personnel in connection with the expansion of fee revenue noted above, and other operating expense of $854,000, which was partly due to additional loan servicing expenses.\n\n**Income Tax Expense** The provision for income taxes was $7.5 million and $25.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to $6.5 million and $24.1 million for the same prior year periods, and $7.1 million for the prior linked quarter. The effective tax rate was 22.9% and 24.4% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 23.9% and 24.0% for the same prior year periods, and 22.5% for the prior linked quarter. The Company’s current quarter effective tax rate was positively impacted by geographic mix as compared to the same prior year period and the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was adversely impacted by the non-recurring write-off of a deferred tax asset of $1.2 million net of other state effects. The prior linked quarter’s effective tax rate was positively impacted by the net effect of state law changes.\n\n**Financial Condition**\n\n_September 30, 2024_ _vs.__December 31, 2023_\n\nTotal assets decreased by $49.8 million to $13.49 billion, from $13.54 billion, primarily due to decreases in loans, partly offset by net increase in total debt securities. Total loans decreased by $172.4 million to $10.02 billion, from $10.19 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the total commercial portfolio of $188.4 million driven by loan payoffs. The loan pipeline increased by $168.6 million to $351.6 million, from $183.0 million. Held-to-maturity debt securities decreased by $84.6 million to $1.08 billion, from $1.16 billion, primarily due to principal repayments. Debt securities available-for-sale increased $157.9 million to $911.8 million, from $753.9 million, primarily due to new purchases. Other assets decreased by $20.3 million to $159.3 million, from $179.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in market values associated with customer interest rate swap programs.\n\nTotal liabilities decreased by $82.3 million to $11.79 billion, from $11.88 billion primarily related to lower deposits and a funding mix shift. Deposits decreased by $318.8 million to $10.12 billion, from $10.43 billion, primarily due to decreases in high-yield savings accounts of $326.9 million and time deposits of $224.6 million, offset by increases in money market accounts of $266.8 million. Time deposits decreased to $2.22 billion, from $2.45 billion, representing 22.0% and 23.4% of total deposits, respectively, which was primarily related to planned runoff of brokered time deposits, which decreased by $430.4 million, offset by increases in retail time deposits of $221.4 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio was 99.1%, as compared to 97.7%. FHLB advances increased by $43.2 million to $891.9 million, from $848.6 million and other borrowings increased by $223.5 million to $419.9 million, from $196.5 million, as a result of lower cost funding availability. \n\nOther liabilities decreased by $43.1 million to $257.6 million, from $300.7 million, primarily due to a decrease in the market values of derivatives associated with customer interest rate swaps and related collateral received from counterparties.\n\nCapital levels remain strong and in excess of “well-capitalized” regulatory levels at September 30, 2024, including the Company’s estimated common equity tier one capital ratio which increased to 11.3%, up approximately 40 basis points from December 31, 2023.\n\nTotal stockholders’ equity increased to $1.69 billion, as compared to $1.66 billion, primarily reflecting net income, partially offset by capital returns comprising of dividends and share repurchases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,383,238 shares totaling $21.5 million representing a weighted average cost of $15.38. The Company had 1,551,200 shares available for repurchase under the authorized repurchase program. Additionally, accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by $8.7 million primarily due to increases in fair market value of available-for-sale debt securities, net of tax.\n\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2024. Based on a quantitative assessment, the Company concluded that goodwill was not impaired. However, the Company continues to monitor its goodwill as further and continued negative industry and economic trends and decline in the Company’s stock price may result in a re-evaluation before the next required annual test.\n\nThe Company’s tangible common equity3 increased by $35.0 million to $1.13 billion. The Company’s stockholders’ equity to assets ratio was 12.56% at September 30, 2024, and tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio increased by 30 basis points during the quarter to 8.68%, primarily due to the drivers described above.\n\nBook value per common share increased to $29.02, as compared to $27.96. Tangible book value per common share3 increased to $19.28, as compared to $18.35.\n\n3 Tangible book value per common share and tangible common equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures and exclude the impact of intangible assets, goodwill, and preferred equity from both stockholders’ equity and total assets. Refer to “Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” tables for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures. \n\n**Asset Quality**\n\n_September 30, 2024_ _vs.__December 31, 2023_\n\nOverall asset quality metrics remained stable. The Company’s non-performing loans decreased to $28.1 million from $29.5 million and represented 0.28% and 0.29% of total loans, respectively. The allowance for loan credit losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 245.45%, as compared to 227.21%. The level of 30 to 89 days delinquent loans decreased to $15.5 million, from $19.2 million. Criticized and classified assets increased to $189.1 million, from $146.9 million. The Company’s allowance for loan credit losses was 0.69% of total loans, as compared to 0.66%. Refer to “Provision for Credit Losses” section for further discussion.\n\nThe Company’s asset quality, excluding purchased with credit deterioration (“PCD”) loans, was as follows. Non-performing loans decreased to $25.3 million, from $26.4 million. The allowance for loan credit losses as a percentage of total non-performing loans was 273.51%, as compared to 254.64%. The level of 30 to 89 days delinquent loans, excluding non-performing loans, decreased to $14.2 million, from $17.7 million. The allowance for loan credit losses plus the unamortized credit and PCD marks amounted to $74.8 million, or 0.75% of total loans, as compared to $74.7 million, or 0.73% of total loans.\n\n**Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** Reported amounts are presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of reported net income excluding non-core operations and in some instances excluding income taxes and provision for credit losses, and reporting equity and asset amounts excluding intangible assets, goodwill or preferred stock, all of which can vary from period to period, provides a better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and, therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, which may be presented by other companies. Refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of these items.\n\n**Conference Call** As previously announced, the Company will host an earnings conference call on Friday, October 18, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

(the “Bank” or “OceanFirst”), a subsidiary of OceanFirst Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:OCFC), has helped ten nonprofit organizations in its market area to apply for and obtain Small Business Recovery Grants totaling $50,000 through a program created by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (FHLBNY). The grants are designed to assist eligible organizations who have faced economic challenges due to the rate environment, inflation, supply-chain constraints, or rising energy costs.\n\nThe ten grants awarded this year will assist nonprofit organizations committed to addressing hunger and food insecurity. Nearly one million people in New Jersey are food insecure, a 22% increase over the previous year, according to Feeding America’s annual [_Map the Meal Gap_](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=VwOG-8N4z4P1NVm9oOh3PUqN2eDapN12BKTYGaSxq2zgsuwi8iD4un0awQBa1LWFaGz7yPGtTbR0c3V5JEErS1SVATwyWbWGthiw7rdLQ6rl2ocj9V2O8rBhKkuD66jbwPDxuUtESE-36CjPgSeoGw==) study. This includes more than 260,000 children –about 1 in 8. Nationwide, the extra amount of money that people facing hunger say they need to have enough food has reached its highest point in the last 20 years.\n\n“The Small Business Recovery Grant Program is a great opportunity for OceanFirst Bank to help support our local nonprofit partners and the important work they are doing to aid our communities,” said George Destafney, OceanFirst Bank Chief Community Banking Officer. “We are so pleased to be able to assist ten organizations to receive important resources that will benefit our neighbors struggling with food insecurity. Our congratulations and appreciation to the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York for another successful Small Business Recovery Grant round.”\n\nUnder the Small Business Recovery Grant Program, banks such as OceanFirst, which are members of the FHLBNY, identify qualified small-business and non-profit customers who are eligible to receive the grant awards.\n\nOceanFirst Bank facilitated Small Business Recovery Grants of $5,000 for each of the following organizations, for a total of $50,000: \n\n  * [Cathedral Soup Kitchen](https://www.cathedralkitchen.org/), Camden, NJ\n  * [Community Services Inc of Ocean County](https://csimow.org/), Stafford, NJ\n  * [Freehold Area Open Door](https://www.faopendoor.org/), Freehold, NJ\n  * [Friendly Fridge](https://www.friendlyfridgefoundation.org/), Bronx, NY\n  * [Meals on Wheels Mercer](https://www.mealsonwheelsmercer.org/), Pennington, NJ\n  * [Meals on Wheels of Greater New Brunswick](https://mowgnb.org/about/), New Brunswick, NJ\n  * [Mercy Center](https://mercycenternj.org/), Asbury Park, NJ\n  * [Move for Hunger](https://moveforhunger.org/about-us/), Neptune, NJ\n  * [Love Ministries Outreach](https://www.loveoutreach2.org/), Rancocas, NJ\n  * [Lunch Break](https://lunchbreak.org/), Red Bank, NJ\n\n\n\n“Meals on Wheels is thrilled to receive a $5,000 grant from OceanFirst Bank. This incredible support will help us provide more meals and cover essential expenses, continuing our mission to deliver nutritious meals and positively impact our seniors’ lives,” said Shareka Fitz, Executive Director, Meals on Wheels Greater New Brunswick.\n\nGwendolyn Love, Executive Director, Lunch Break, added, “The $5,000 grant from OceanFirst Bank will help ensure efficient kitchen and pantry operations, providing healthy and nutritious meals to food-insecure families and individuals in our community.”\n\n“Located in the Bronx, a borough with the highest rates of diabetes in the country, the Friendly Fridge BX focuses on rescuing and redirecting healthy foods to share with people from all over the Bronx and Yonkers,” shared Sara Allen, co-founder of Friendly Fridge BX. “With the support of this $5,000 grant from OceanFirst Bank, over 1,800 visitors per week who come in search of healthy food will have access to over 117,000 lbs. of fresh produce over the course of 13 weeks.”\n\nOceanFirst Bank N.A., a subsidiary of OceanFirst Financial Corp. founded in 1902 is a $13.3 billion regional bank providing financial services throughout New Jersey and the major metropolitan areas between Massachusetts and Virginia.

It is a great opportunity for the Bank to extend a helping hand to our neighbors in the communities where our employees live and work,” said Joe Lebel, OceanFirst Bank President and Chief Operating Officer. “With more than 700 employees participating in Comm**UNITY** First Day 2024, we were proud to assist our nonprofit partners and the people they serve.”\n\nMeals on Wheels of Ocean County (“Meals on Wheels”) was one of the more than 75 nonprofit organizations that hosted OceanFirst employees for Comm**UNITY** First Day 2024. According to Heather deJong, Community Relations Specialist at Meals on Wheels, “Meals on Wheels of Ocean County is so appreciative of the army of volunteers we had during Comm**UNITY** First Day. We deliver 1,000 meals each day, Monday thru Friday, to our homebound and food insecure seniors and OceanFirst’s volunteers saved our kitchen staff a day’s worth of work by prepping and putting the cold components of our meal into 1,000 grab-and-go bags that our drivers will now deliver along with the hot entrée and sides tomorrow.”\n\nSince Comm**UNITY** First Day was established, OceanFirst Bank employees have volunteered almost 9,000 hours in conjunction with Comm**UNITY** First Day. Volunteer opportunities are coordinated for OceanFirst employees in collaboration with OceanFirst Foundation, whose mission is to empower nonprofits to think bigger, solve more problems, and make life better in the neighborhoods served by OceanFirst Bank.\n\nOceanFirst Bank N.A., a subsidiary of OceanFirst Financial Corp., founded in 1902, is a $13.3 billion regional bank providing financial services throughout New Jersey and in the major metropolitan areas between Massachusetts and Virginia.
