Announces Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nOctober 24, 2024\n\n[ Download (opens in new window) ](//s22.q4cdn.com/200744459/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/TXRH-2024-Q3-Earnings-Release-Final.pdf)\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 24, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (NasdaqGS: TXRH), today announced financial results for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 24, 2024.\n\n**Financial Results**\n\nFinancial results for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 24, 2024 and September 26, 2023 were as follows:\n\n**13 Weeks Ended**| **39 Weeks Ended**  \n---|---  \n($000's, except per share amounts)| **September 24, 2024**| **September 26, 2023**| **% change**| **September 24, 2024**| **September 26, 2023**| **% change**  \nTotal revenue| $|  1,272,999| $|  1,121,752| 13.5| %| $|  3,935,418| $|  3,467,311|  13.5| %  \nIncome from operations|  102,023|  73,859| 38.1| %|  377,967|  270,216|  39.9| %  \nNet income|  84,412|  63,788| 32.3| %|  317,759|  232,446|  36.7| %  \nDiluted earnings per share| $|  1.26| $|  0.95| 32.5| %| $|  4.74| $|  3.46|  37.0| %  \n  \nResults for the 13 weeks ended September 24, 2024, as compared to the prior year as applicable, included the following:\n\n  * Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.5% at company restaurants and increased 7.2% at domestic franchise restaurants;\n\n\n  * Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $149,176 of which $18,914 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $138,668 of which $17,058 were to-go sales in the prior year;\n\n\n  * Restaurant margin dollars increased 24.1% to $202.1 million from $162.8 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 16.0% from 14.6% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.7% and commodity inflation of 1.3%;\n\n\n  * Diluted earnings per share increased 32.5% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses;\n\n\n  * Seven company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened; and\n\n\n  * Capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $91.1 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $9.6 million.\n\n\n\nResults for the 39 weeks ended September 24, 2024, as compared to the prior year as applicable, included the following:\n\n  * Comparable restaurant sales increased 8.8% at company restaurants and increased 7.7% at domestic franchise restaurants;\n\n\n  * Average weekly sales at company restaurants were $155,807 of which $19,894 were to-go sales as compared to average weekly sales of $144,583 of which $18,189 were to-go sales in the prior year;\n\n\n  * Restaurant margin dollars increased 26.7% to $673.1 million from $531.3 million in the prior year primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 17.2% from 15.4% in the prior year driven primarily by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.5% and commodity inflation of 0.8%;\n\n\n  * Diluted earnings per share increased 37.0% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses;\n\n\n  * 22 company restaurants and nine franchise restaurants were opened; and\n\n\n  * Capital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $246.5 million, dividends of $122.2 million, and repurchases of common stock of $44.7 million.\n\n\n\nJerry Morgan, Chief Executive Officer of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. commented, “We are extremely pleased in such a competitive environment to report another quarter of continued traffic growth at each of our brands. This is a credit to the hard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”\n\nMorgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already have 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with our planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term shareholder value.”\n\n**Franchise Acquisition**\n\nThe Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due diligence.\n\n**2024 Outlook**\n\nComparable restaurant sales at company restaurants for the first four weeks of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 8.3% compared to 2023. In addition, the Company implemented a menu price increase of approximately 0.9% in late September.\n\nManagement updated the following expectations for 2024:\n\n  * Commodity cost inflation of less than 1%;\n  * Wage and other labor inflation of approximately 4.5%; and\n  * An effective income tax rate of approximately 15%.\n\n\n\nManagement reiterated the following expectations for 2024:\n\n  * Positive comparable restaurant sales growth including the benefit of menu pricing actions;\n  * Store week growth of approximately 7.5%, including a benefit of 2% from the 53rd week; and\n  * Total capital expenditures of $360 million to $370 million.\n\n\n\n**2025 Outlook**\n\nManagement provided the following initial expectations for 2025:\n\n  * Positive comparable restaurant sales growth including the benefit of 2024 menu pricing actions;\n  * Store week growth of approximately 5%, including a benefit of 2% from the planned franchise acquisition;\n  * Commodity cost inflation of 2% to 3%;\n  * Wage and other labor inflation of 4% to 5%;\n  * An effective income tax rate of 15% to 16%; and\n  * Total capital expenditures of approximately $400 million.\n\n\n\n**Non-GAAP Measures**\n\nThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Within the press release, the Company makes reference to restaurant margin (in dollars, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, and per store week). Restaurant margin represents restaurant and other sales less restaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage costs, labor, rent, and other operating costs. Restaurant margin should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income from operations. This non-GAAP measure is not indicative of overall company performance and profitability in that this measure does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders due to the nature of the costs excluded. Restaurant margin is widely regarded as a useful metric by which to evaluate core restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis. In calculating restaurant margin, the Company excludes certain non-restaurant-level costs that support operations, but do not have a direct impact on restaurant-level operational efficiency and performance, including general and administrative expenses. The Company excludes pre-opening expenses as they occur at irregular intervals and would impact comparability to prior period results. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expenses, substantially all of which relate to restaurant-level assets, as they represent a non-cash charge for the investment in restaurants. The Company excludes impairment and closure expenses as it believes this provides a clearer perspective of ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry. A reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant margin is included in the accompanying financial tables.\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. is hosting a conference call today, October 24, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.

You may vote “FOR” or “AGAINST” the shareholder proposal, or you may “ABSTAIN” from\nvoting Con this proposal. A vote to “ABSTAIN” will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” approval of the\nshareholder proposal.\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “AGAINST” THIS PROPOSAL.\nOther Matters\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the Board knows of no matters that will be presented for\nconsideration at the Annual Meeting other than those matters discussed in this proxy statement. If any other\nmatters should properly come before the Annual Meeting and call for a vote of shareholders, then validly\nexecuted proxies in the enclosed form returned to us will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of\nthe Board, or, in the absence of such a recommendation, in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.\nAny such additional matter must be approved by an affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present (in person\nor by proxy) and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.\n3\nINFORMATION ABOUT PROXIES AND VOTING\nRecord Date and Voting Securities\nThe Board has fixed the record date (the “Record Date”) for the Annual Meeting as the close of business\non March 18, 2024. Only shareholders of record at the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to\nvote at the Annual Meeting and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. At the close of business on the\nRecord Date, there were outstanding 66,864,958 shares of common stock, each of which is entitled to one vote\nper share on all matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting.\nThe presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock will\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Shares of common stock represented\nby properly executed proxies received before the close of voting at the Annual Meeting will be voted as directed\nby such shareholders, unless revoked as described below.\nRevocability of Proxies\nA shareholder who completes and returns the proxy card that accompanies this proxy statement may\nrevoke that proxy at any time before the closing of the polls at the Annual Meeting. A shareholder may revoke a\nproxy by voting at a later date by one of the methods described on the proxy card or by filing a written notice of\nrevocation with, or by delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date to, Christopher C. Colson, the\nCorporate Secretary of the Company, at the Company’s main office address located at 6040 Dutchmans Lane,\nLouisville, Kentucky 40205 at any time before the Annual Meeting. Shareholders may also revoke proxies by\ndelivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date to the inspector of election at the Annual Meeting before\nthe close of voting or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. You may attend the Annual Meeting\neven though you have executed a proxy, but your presence at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke\nyour proxy.\nSolicitation of Proxies\nThe cost of solicitation of proxies being solicited on behalf of the Board will be borne by us (as and if\napplicable). In addition to solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited personally, by telephone or by other\nmeans by our directors, officers or employees, who receive no additional compensation for these solicitation\nactivities. We will, upon request, reimburse brokerage houses and persons holding common stock in the names\nof their nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in sending materials to their principals.\nOther Voting Considerations\nBroker Non-Votes. Under rules of the New York Stock Exchange, matters subject to shareholder vote\nare classified as “routine” or “non-routine.” In the case of routine matters, brokers may vote shares held in “street\nname” in their discretion if they have not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. In the case of\nnon-routine matters, brokers may not vote shares unless they have received voting instructions from the\nbeneficial owner (“broker non-votes”); therefore, it is important that you complete and return your proxy early\nso that your vote may be recorded.\nThe election of directors (Proposal 1) is a non-routine matter under the applicable rules, so broker\nnon-votes may occur. However, broker non-votes do not count as shares entitled to vote. Because the election\nis decided by a plurality of shares present (in person or by proxy) and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, and\nbecause our majority voting policy for directors only considers “FOR” votes and “WITHHOLD” votes, any broker\nnon-votes will not affect the outcome of Proposal 1.\nThe ratification of the appointment of the Company’s independent auditors (Proposal 2) is a routine\nmatter under the applicable rules so broker non-votes should not occur. In addition, because this matter is routine\nand brokers may vote as stated above, the number of votes cast, plus the number of abstentions, on Proposal\n2 will be used to establish whether a quorum is present.\n4\nThe advisory vote on the approval of executive compensation (Proposal 3), the advisory vote on the\nshareholder proposal regarding the issuance of a climate report and to set reduction targets by the Company\n(Proposal 7), and any other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting are also non-routine\nmatters under the applicable rules, so broker non-votes may occur. Because broker non-votes do not count as\nshares entitled to vote, they do not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposals 3 and 7. With respect to the vote\non amending and restating the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to remove\nreferences to Class B shares (Proposal 4), the vote to amend the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate\nof Incorporation to include an exculpation of officers (Proposal 5), the vote to amend the Company’s Bylaws to\nreduce the percentage required to request a special meeting of shareholders (Proposal 6), broker non-votes will\nhave the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” Proposal 4, 5, and/or 6 (as applicable).\nAbstentions. Abstentions will be counted for purposes of calculating whether a quorum is present. The\neffect of an abstention on each proposal where “ABSTAIN” is a voting choice is discussed above.\nExecuted but Unmarked Proxies. If no instructions are given, then shares represented by properly\nexecuted but unmarked proxies will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board, or, in the\nabsence of such a recommendation, in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.\n5\nANNUAL MEETING FAQS\nWHEN AND WHERE IS THE ANNUAL MEETING?\nThe 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held at the Texas Roadhouse Support Center located at 6040\nDutchmans Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40205 on Thursday, May 16, 2024 at 9:00 a.m. eastern daylight time.\nWHO CAN ATTEND THE ANNUAL MEETING?\nThe Annual Meeting is open to all shareholders.

Of the seven meetings of the Board, three\nwere joint meetings among the Board, the compensation committee and/or the nominating and corporate\ngovernance committee.\nNew Board Member\nOn June 2, 2023, Wayne L. Jones was appointed to the Board as an independent director. In connection\nwith the appointment, the Board desired to add a Board member with extensive restaurant industry\nexperience. Mr. Jones was nominated as a non-employee director because of his chief executive and board\nof director experience as well as his extensive knowledge of the restaurant industry where he has over 40\nyears of experience in the industry.\nOn February 28, 2024, Jane Grote Abell was appointed to the Board as an independent director. In\nconnection with the appointment, the Board desired to add a Board member with extensive restaurant\nindustry experience. Ms. Abell was nominated as a non-employee director because of her executive and\nboard experience as well as her extensive knowledge of the restaurant industry where she has over 30 years\nof experience in the industry.\nBoard Composition\n2023\nIn 2023, the Board consisted of eight directors – seven of which are independent, as that term is defined in\nthe listing standards under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe following is a breakdown of committee membership and leadership during the 2023 fiscal year:\n1) Chairman of the Board: Gregory N. Moore\n2) Audit Committee: Donna E. Epps (Chair); Michael A. Crawford; Wayne L. Jones; Gregory N. Moore;\nCurtis A. Warfield; and James R. Zarley. Kathleen M. Widmer also served on the Audit Committee\nfor a portion of the 2023 fiscal year.\n3) Compensation Committee: James R. Zarley (Chair); Michael A. Crawford; Donna E. Epps; Wayne\nL. Jones; Gregory N. Moore; Curtis A. Warfield; and Kathleen M. Widmer\n4) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee: Curtis A. Warfield (Chair); Michael A. Crawford;\nDonna E. Epps; Wayne L. Jones; Gregory N. Moore; Kathleen M. Widmer; and James R. Zarley\n9\n2024\nThe Board currently consists of nine directors – seven of which are independent, as that term is defined in\nthe listing standards under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence\nunder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe following is a breakdown of current committee membership and leadership:\n1) Chairman of the Board: Gregory N. Moore\n2) Audit Committee: Donna E. Epps (Chair); Michael A. Crawford; Wayne L. Jones; Gregory N. Moore;\nand Curtis A. Warfield\n3) Compensation Committee: Michael A. Crawford (Chair); Gregory N. Moore; and Kathleen M. Widmer\n4) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee: Curtis A. Warfield (Chair); Donna E. Epps;\nWayne L. Jones; and Kathleen M. Widmer\nCompensation Philosophy\nWith respect to each non-employee director’s 2023 fiscal year service, each non-employee director received\na fixed cash amount for serving on the Board, together with additional compensation relating to leadership\npositions on the Board and/or on any Board committee. Additionally, the Chairman of the Board received an\nannual grant of service based restricted stock units equal to $313,000 divided by the closing sales price of\nthe Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding\nthe date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares, while each\nremaining non-employee director received an annual grant of service based restricted stock units equal to\n$223,000 divided by the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select\nMarket on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up\nor down to the nearest 100 shares.\nSimilar to our compensation philosophy for our executive officers, we believe that issuing service based\nrestricted stock units to our non-employee directors aligns their interests with those of our shareholders.\nSpecifically, since the bulk of each non-employee director’s compensation lies in the value of the service\nbased restricted stock units granted, the non-employee directors are motivated to continually improve the\nCompany’s performance in the hope that the performance will be reflected by the stock price on the vesting\ndate of their service based restricted stock units. Moreover, we believe that the service based restricted stock\nunit awards drive director alignment with maximizing shareholder value because the value of the service\nbased restricted stock units varies in response to investor sentiment regarding overall Company performance\nat the time of vesting.\nCap on Total Compensation\nThe total compensation for any non-employee director may not exceed $500,000, which amount shall be\ncalculated by adding (i) the total cash compensation to be paid for services rendered by a non-employee\ndirector in any given fiscal year to (ii) the grant date value of any equity granted to such non-employee director\nin that fiscal year. This cap on Board total compensation is included in the Company’s 2021 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan.\n10\nMandatory Retirement Age for Board Service\nIn November 2019, the Board and the nominating and corporate governance committee determined that it is\nadvisable and in the best interest of the Company to establish a mandatory retirement age for the non-\nemployee directors on the Board. In furtherance of the foregoing, in no event shall any non-employee be\nelected, re-elected, and/or appointed to the Board if such non-employee is 75 years or older at the time of\nsuch election, re-election, and/or appointment; provided, however, any director who began serving on the\nBoard prior to 2006 shall be permitted to be re-elected to the Board so long as they are not 80 years or older\nat the time of such re-election.\nIn furtherance of this policy, Mr. Zarley is being nominated for re-election for the last time at the Annual\nMeeting. Mr. Zarley is our longest tenured member of the Board, being appointed to the Board in 2004 as a\npart of the Company’s initial public offering. He was appointed to the Board because of his chief executive\nand information technology experience in developing industries, his technology experience, and his\ntransactional experience. During his time on the Board, he has continued to serve on each of the three\ncommittees of the Board and has provided both formal and informal mentorship and leadership, most recently\nas the chairperson of the compensation committee. The Company thanks Mr. Zarley for his almost 20 years\nof service to the Board and the tremendous value that he has brought to the Company during his tenure,\nincluding during key transitional moments in the Company’s history (specifically following the sudden passing\nof our founder Kent Taylor).\nShareholder Engagement\nDuring 2023, management of the Company interacted with shareholders owning approximately 65% of the\noutstanding shares of the Company as of the end of fiscal year 2023. These interactions ranged from one-\non-one phone/video calls, face-to-face meetings at investor conferences, video calls during virtual non-deal\nroadshows, participants listening to virtual fireside chats between members of management and sell-side\nanalysts, and conversations with stewardship teams regarding corporate governance.\nDirector Summary Overview\nOUR DIRECTOR NOMINEES\nCommittee Membership\nDirector Independent\nNominee Age Since (Y/N) A C N\nJane Grote Abell 57 2024 Y\nMichael A.

Of the\nseven meetings of the Board, three were joint meetings among the Board, the compensation committee and/or\nthe nominating and corporate governance committee. Each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the\naggregate number of meetings of the Board and its committees on which such director served during his or her\nperiod of service in fiscal 2023. In addition, the Company expects all members of the Board to attend the Annual\nMeeting. All incumbent directors attended the 2023 annual meeting. Four regular Board meetings are currently\nscheduled for the 2024 fiscal year. Executive sessions of non-employee directors, without management directors\nor employees present, are typically scheduled in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Board meeting. The\nrole of each standing committee is more fully described below.\nLeadership Structure of the Board and Role of the Board in Strategy and Risk Oversight\nLeadership Structure. The Board consists of seven independent directors, one non-independent non-\nemployee director and one executive director. Following the passing of W. Kent Taylor, the Company’s founder\nand then Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the Board named Gregory N.\nMoore as Chairman of the Board on March 19, 2021. Mr. Moore joined the Board in 2005 following the\nCompany’s initial public offering in 2004. Until his appointment as Chairman of the Board, Mr. Moore had\npreviously served as the Board’s Lead Independent director since the creation of that position in 2012. The\nresponsibility and authority of the Lead Independent director are delineated in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, which can be found on the Company’s website at www.texasroadhouse.com. The Board determined\nthat a separation of the duties and responsibilities of the Chairman of the Board from those of the Chief Executive\nOfficer was appropriate during the transition following the death of the Company’s founder. As more particularly\ndescribed below, Mr. Morgan, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, was appointed to the Board on June 15,\n2021.\nRole of the Board and Management. As more specifically described in our Corporate Governance\nGuidelines, the Company’s business is conducted by the officers and employees under the direction of the\nChairman of the Company, and if there is no Chairman, then the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and\nunder the oversight of the Board. In connection with the same, the Board’s role is to enhance the long-term\nvalue of the Company for its shareholders. The Board is elected annually by the Company’s shareholders to\noversee management and the execution of the Company’s strategy, and to ensure that the long-term interests\nof the shareholders are being served. In order to fulfill these obligations, the Board is responsible for establishing\nbroad corporate policies, setting and overseeing the Company’s strategic direction and overseeing the\nmanagement of the Company.\nStrategic Planning and Strategic Initiatives. In addition to and as part of the broad responsibilities\ndescribed in the immediately preceding paragraph, the Board plays an instrumental oversight role in the strategic\nplanning and initiatives of the Company to ensure that the appropriate processes, systems, and organizational\ninfrastructure is in place to support and align all management teams and functions toward the execution of the\nCompany’s mission, vision and purpose. The Board’s oversight role includes succession and organizational\nplanning, human capital management, governance, corporate policy and process development, enterprise risk\nmanagement, business planning and development, and capital structure and allocation.\nAs a part of this role, the Board reviews the Company’s strategy with management to ensure that the\nCompany and the Board are aligned on the long-term goals and strategic initiatives of the Company. At every\nquarterly Board meeting, the Board and management conduct a strategic overview of one of the Company’s\nmain restaurant brands (including the international business) and is continually updated throughout the year on\nthe performance of each brand or business unit. Additionally, the Board conducts periodic reviews of the manner\nin which the Company is allocating its capital to ensure that the Board and the management of the Company are\nin agreement on how the Company is managing its asset portfolio. Finally, the Board provides direct oversight\nover certain other strategic initiatives or transactions implemented by the Company, including new store\n17\ndevelopment, franchise acquisitions and development, international development, retail or other business\ndevelopment initiatives, and the Company’s share repurchase activities and dividend program (as applicable).\nThe Board executes its strategic oversight responsibility directly and through its committees as more particularly\ndescribed below.\nRisk Oversight. The Board is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s risk management strategy,\nincluding the Company’s implementation of appropriate processes to administer day-to-day risk management.\nThe Board executes its oversight responsibility directly and through its committees and is informed about risk\nmanagement matters as part of its role in its general oversight and approval of corporate matters. The Board\nprovides the Company’s management with clear guidance on the risks it believes face the Company, such as\nthe matters disclosed as risk factors in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, the Board has\ndelegated certain risk management responsibilities to its audit committee and compensation committee.\nPursuant to the audit committee’s charter, the Board has authorized the audit committee to oversee the\nCompany’s risk assessment and risk management practices, and disclosures, including, without limitation, the\nCompany’s financial strategies, insurance plans, cyber risk, business continuity, and corporate sustainability. As\na part of its oversight responsibilities and as more specifically discussed below, the audit committee evaluates\nthe overall enterprise risk of the entire Company, as well as regularly and comprehensively reviews specific risk\nmatters which have been identified by management. This includes a rotational review of the risks relating to\nspecific departments within the Company. The Company’s internal auditors regularly report directly to the audit\ncommittee on the results of internal audits, the scope and frequency of which are based on comprehensive risk\nassessments which have been approved by the audit committee.\nILLUSTRATIVE DEPICTION OF ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\nAUDIT COMMITTEE\nEXECUTIVE RISK\nCOMMITTEE\nERM TEAM\nSUBJECT MATTER\nRISK COMMITTEES\nAs a part of our enterprise risk management process and under the oversight of the audit committee,\nthe Company has formed a series of subject matter risk committees that are composed of cross-functional\nleaders within the Company that specialize in specific areas of risk previously identified by the Company, which\nregularly meet and report their activities to the enterprise risk management (“ERM”) team. These subject matter\nrisk committees focus on specific risks relating to business continuity / crisis management, food safety,\nresponsible alcohol service, employment compliance, information governance (including data privacy\ncompliance), vendor management, employee and guest safety, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and\ncorporate sustainability. The ERM team, consisting of our Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, Vice President\nof Finance, Associate General Counsel – Brand Protection, Vice President of Legendary People, Director of\n18\nRisk, Director of Internal Audit, and Program Director of Business Continuity and Data Privacy, meets regularly\nto identify emerging risk areas and key risk areas for the Company, and serves as a liaison between the subject\nmatter risk committees and the executive risk committee described below. Additionally, the ERM team conducts\na periodic review of a risk register, including an in-depth focus on high priority risks, as well as evaluates the\ncomposition of existing subject matter risk committees and/or the potential need for the creation of new subject\nmatter risk committees based on its review of the risk register and conducts a gap analysis with respect to the\nkey risks identified on the Company’s risk register to the Company’s applicable lines of available insurance\ncoverage. The risk register is reviewed with the audit committee and the executive risk committee. Finally, the\nCompany has an executive risk committee consisting of the Named Executive Officers and the Vice Presidents\nof Operation for each of the Company’s three main concepts which meet throughout the year to determine risk\npriorities and make decisions on key areas of risk.\nAdditionally, as indicated above, the ERM team regularly updates the audit committee on the results of\nits risk management activities at least twice per year. Moreover, specific subject matter risk committees\nperiodically report to the audit committee the risk-based initiatives being performed by the applicable risk\ncommittee. The audit committee is routinely advised of strategic, operational, financial, legal, data privacy,\ncorporate sustainability, responsible alcohol service, and cybersecurity risks, and the audit committee reviews\nand is informed of specific activities to manage these risks, such as policies and procedures, insurance plans,\nindemnification obligations, and internal controls (as and if applicable).\nPursuant to the compensation committee’s charter, the Board has authorized the compensation\ncommittee to oversee the compensation programs for the Company’s executive officers and non-employee\ndirectors. The compensation committee, in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, designs the compensation\npackages applicable to the Company’s executive officers and Board members. The compensation committee\nalso periodically consults with management on the payments of bonuses and grants of stock awards to key\nemployees.\nThe audit committee and the compensation committee jointly perform an annual risk assessment of our\ncompensation programs for all employees to determine whether these programs encourage unnecessary or\nexcessive risk taking. In conducting this review, each of our compensation programs is evaluated on a number\nof criteria aimed at identifying any incentive programs that deviate from our risk management objectives. Based\non this review in 2023, both the audit committee and the compensation committee concluded that we have the\nright combination of rewards and incentives to drive company performance, without encouraging unnecessary\nor excessive risk taking by our employees. In connection with the foregoing, the Company has not established\na system of incentives that is reasonably likely to lead to excessive or inappropriate risk taking by employees or\ncreate a risk reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Specifically, the audit and\ncompensation committees identified the following components of our compensation programs that mitigate the\nlikelihood of excessive risk taking to meet performance targets: equity incentive compensation in the form of\nrestricted stock units; long term contracts and a financial buy-in requirement for restaurant management; a\nguaranteed base salary within our support center management personnel; minimums and maximums on profit\nsharing compensation within our support center management personnel; robust internal controls; operational\nfocus on top line sales growth; and, a business model which focuses on a strong balance sheet, relatively low\ndebt, prudent growth, and sustainable long-term profitability.\nThe Board’s oversight roles, including the roles of the audit committee and the compensation committee,\nallow the Board to effectively administer risk management policies while also effectively and efficiently\naddressing Company objectives. The Board expects to continue to involve Company management in its\ndeliberations and decision-making in order to administer risk management policies effectively.\nCybersecurity. In the course of our operations, the Company receives and maintains sensitive\ninformation from our guests, employees, partners and business operations. To address cybersecurity threats to\nthis information, the Company has used a risk-based approach to create and implement a detailed set of\ninformation security policies and procedures that are based on frameworks established by the National Institute\nof Standards and Technology. The Company’s Head of Information Security leads the Company’s cybersecurity\nefforts under the direct oversight of our Chief Technology Officer. Together, these individuals have over 50 years\nof experience involving information technology, including security, auditing, compliance, systems and\n19\nprogramming. Additionally, the Company engages in the use of external cybersecurity experts for training,\ncontingency planning, consultation and process documentation.\nThe Company has implemented detective and preventative controls designed to ensure the appropriate\nlevel of protection for the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data stored on or transferred through our\ninformation technology resources. Additionally, we have a risk assessment process to identify risks associated\nwith our use of third-party service providers and have implemented specific processes and controls designed to\nmitigate those identified risks. Both internal and third-party audits are performed routinely to verify that these\ncontrols are effective. Additionally, the Company has implemented trainings designed to provide best practices\nfor protecting our network and systems, and also routinely leads exercises for employees to reinforce the risk\nand proper handling of targeted emails. The Company’s Head of Information Security is responsible for\ndeveloping and implementing these controls and training exercises with support from our information technology\ndepartment.\nThe Company’s enterprise risk management program has established an internal risk committee to\nevaluate information governance risks. This committee comprises members of management of the Company’s\ninformation technology, human resources, marketing, accounting, risk, procurement, training, finance and legal\nfunctions, and is focused on performing risk assessments to identify areas of concern and implement appropriate\nchanges to enhance its cybersecurity and privacy policies and procedures. The internal risk committee is\ninformed of the Company’s risk prevention and mitigation efforts on at least a quarterly basis by the Head of\nInformation Security. The committee is also briefed on detection and remediation of cybersecurity incidents in a\ntimely manner following the detection of any potential events.\nThe Company has a crisis response team comprising senior members of various corporate functions to\noversee the response to various crises including potential crises arising from cybersecurity incidents that may\nimpact the Company and/or its vendor partners. This team conducts regular tabletop exercises to simulate\nresponses to cybersecurity incidents. To the extent there is a cybersecurity incident impacting the Company\nand/or a vendor partner, the crisis response team’s process would be to ensure that our Head of Information\nSecurity and Chief Technology Officer are informed immediately and that the potential impact of the incident and\nremedial measures arising from the incident are communicated to the executive officers of the Company.\nThe Board has authorized the audit committee to oversee the Company’s risk assessment and risk\nmanagement practices and strategies. This delegation includes maintaining responsibility for overseeing the\nCompany’s enterprise risk management program. As a part of this oversight role, the audit committee receives\nregular updates from management on cybersecurity and privacy risks impacting the Company, which includes\nbenchmarking these risks versus the industry. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with\nmanagement on cybersecurity-related news events, receive training specific to cybersecurity risks and threats\nand regularly discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\nCorporate Sustainability. The Board and the Company take great pride in our corporate sustainability\nprogram and our appreciation for, and commitment to, our employees and for the communities in which we\nserve. Our commitment is evident from our passion and history of dedication to corporate citizenship, diversity,\nand the manner in which we often consider sustainability as part of our strategy, operating model and overall\ndecision-making process. This commitment also includes the continued execution of our existing corporate\nsustainability activities, as well as the identification of future opportunities. We actively pursue opportunities and\npartnerships that help conserve resources, reduce waste, and have a positive impact on our communities, as\nwell as partner with other organizations and source products from suppliers who share our commitment to\ncorporate sustainability. As a result, the Board reviews the Company’s corporate sustainability initiatives as a\npart of their oversight role of the Company’s business strategy and risk management. In particular, the Board\nreceives periodic updates, at least annually, of our corporate sustainability initiatives from management. The\nCompany also includes an update on some of these initiatives in the Company’s Annual Report.\nAdditionally and as described above, risks relating to corporate sustainability are managed by the\nCompany as a part of the Company’s enterprise management program and under the oversight of the audit\ncommittee. In connection with the same, the Company has established an internal subject matter risk committee\nto evaluate environmental, social and governance matters. This committee is comprised of members of\n20\nmanagement from the Company’s legal, human resources, communications, procurement, investor relations,\nand financial reporting functions. At least annually, the corporate sustainability risk committee reports to the\naudit committee of the risk-based initiatives being performed by the committee.\nIn 2017, we released our initial corporate sustainability report which outlined the four core pillars of our\ncorporate sustainability efforts: Food, Community, Employees, and Conservation. Our goal is to update our\ncorporate sustainability report annually. The current report is available on the Company’s website at\nwww.texasroadhouse.com.

In connection with the\naudit committee’s appointment of the Company’s independent auditors, the audit committee evaluates the\nservice level of the incumbent independent auditor on an annual basis, which includes criteria such as prior year\nquality of service, industry and technical expertise, independence, resource availability, and reasonableness and\ncompetitiveness of fees, as well as solicits the input of key management employees during its evaluation.\nThe audit committee reviews all of the Company’s earning press releases, Quarterly and Annual Reports\non Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively, prior to filing with the SEC, and such other applicable financial\ndisclosure documents (as and if applicable). The audit committee is also responsible for producing an annual\nreport on its activities for inclusion in this proxy statement. The Board evaluated the credentials of and designated\nMs. Epps and Messrs. Moore and Warfield as audit committee financial experts. The audit committee met 12\ntimes during fiscal year 2023, which were comprised of six regular meetings of the audit committee and six\nmeetings solely related to the audit committee’s review of the Company’s quarterly earnings release and filings\n21\nwith the SEC. During the 2023 fiscal year, the audit committee was comprised of Ms. Epps and\nMessrs. Crawford, Jones, Moore, Warfield, and Zarley.

All of the current members of the audit committee are “independent,”\nas that term is defined in the listing standards under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria\nfor independence under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules adopted by the SEC, and all members\nof the audit committee during the 2023 fiscal year were “independent” under such applicable rules.\nCompensation Committee. As described in its charter, the compensation committee:\n(i) assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to the design, administration and oversight\nof employee compensation programs and benefit plans of the Company’s executive officers;\n(ii) discharges the Board’s duties relating to the compensation of the Company’s executive officers\nand non-employee directors; and\n(iii) reviews the performance of the Company’s executive officers.\nThe compensation committee is also responsible for reviewing and discussing with management the\n“Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in this proxy statement and recommending its inclusion in this proxy\nstatement to the Board, as well as performing the other duties and responsibilities described in its charter. The\ncompensation committee met four times during fiscal year 2023. During the 2023 fiscal year, the compensation\ncommittee was comprised of Mss. Epps and Widmer and Messrs.

As described in its charter, the nominating and\ncorporate governance committee assists the Board in:\n(i) identifying potential candidates for consideration in the event of vacancy on the Board and/or the\nBoard determines that a new director is necessary and screen individuals qualified to become members of the\nBoard consistent with the nominating and corporate governance committee’s screening guidelines and criteria;\n(ii) if a vacancy on the Board occurs, making recommendations to the Board regarding the selection\nand approval of the candidate to fill such vacancy either by election by the Company’s shareholders or\nappointment by the Board;\n(iii) reviewing the qualifications and independence of, approving the nominations of, and\nrecommending to the Board those persons to be nominated for membership on the Board and presented for\nshareholder approval at the annual meeting;\n(iv) developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles; and\n(v) periodically reporting to the Board the status of succession planning for senior management,\nincluding guidance regarding succession in the event of an emergency or the retirement of the executive officers\nand the identification and evaluation of potential successors to the executive officers and other members of\nsenior management.\nAdditionally, the nominating and corporate governance committee annually conducts on the Board’s\nbehalf a confidential self-assessment. As a part of the annual self-assessment, each director provides, without\n22\nlimitation, an assessment on the effectiveness and functionality of the Board. Each director completes an\nassessment form and sends it to the chairperson of the nominating and corporate governance committee, who\ncompiles the results and presents them to the Board. In connection with such self-assessment process and the\npreparation of the Company’s D&O Questionnaires, the nominating and corporate governance committee,\ntogether with the Chairman of the Board, evaluate each director’s upcoming professional responsibilities to\ndetermine the committees on which such non-employee directors will serve and to evaluate each director’s ability\nto perform its duties as set forth in the Company’s corporate governance guidelines.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee routinely evaluates the size and composition of\nthe Board and the variety of professional expertise represented by the Board members in relation to the\nCompany’s business. To assist in this process, the nominating and corporate governance committee has\nidentified certain interpersonal skills and professional skills desirable for some and/or all of the directors on the\nBoard. The interpersonal skills are personal attributes that each director should possess and include ethics and\nintegrity, leadership skills, negotiation skills, and crisis management skills. The professional skills are an\nassessment of governance and industry-based skill areas which should be held collectively by the Board but not\nnecessarily by each director and contain skills relating to (i) financial, risk, and compliance skills, (ii) governance\nand management skills, and (iii) sector and industry specific skills. As a part of its review of those persons to be\nnominated for membership on the Board at the Annual Meeting, the nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee takes a holistic view of the Board to strive to have a diverse Board in terms of core skills, industry\nexperience, tenure and other diversity characteristics.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee met four times during fiscal year 2023. During\nthe 2023 fiscal year, the nominating and corporate governance committee was comprised of Mss. Epps\nand Widmer and Messrs. Crawford, Jones, Moore, Warfield, and Zarley. During the 2024 fiscal year, the\nnominating and corporate governance committee is comprised of Mss. Epps and Widmer and Messrs. Jones\nand Warfield. Mr. Warfield currently serves as the chairperson of the nominating and corporate governance\ncommittee and was the chairperson of the nominating and corporate governance committee during the 2023\nfiscal year.

The manner in which the nominating and corporate governance committee\nevaluates a potential nominee will not differ based on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder\nof the Company.\nThe Company currently retains a corporate recruiter to assist in identifying candidates for open positions\nat the Company. Upon request, this recruiter also assists in identifying and evaluating candidates for director.\nWhile the Company does not routinely pay an additional fee for this service, based on the recent additions to\nour Board described below, we have paid certain amounts to a corporate recruiter for their assistance in our\nnationwide searches.\nOn June 2, 2023, the nominating and corporate governance committee recommended to the Board that\nthe number of directors be increased by one and that Mr. Jones be appointed to the Board as an independent\ndirector; the Board approved this recommendation. In connection with the appointment, the Board desired to\nadd a Board member with extensive restaurant industry experience. Mr. Jones was referred to the nominating\nand corporate governance committee by our corporate recruiter following a nationwide search. Following his\nreferral, Mr. Jones met extensively with management of the Company and our existing members of the Board\nprior to the nominating and corporate governance committee’s decision to recommend his appointment.\nMr. Jones was nominated as a non-employee director because of his chief executive and board of director\nexperience as well as his extensive knowledge of the restaurant industry where he has over 40 years of\nexperience in the industry.\nAdditionally, on February 28, 2024, the nominating and corporate governance committee recommended\nto the Board that the number of directors be increased by one and that Ms. Abell be appointed to the Board as\nan independent director; the Board approved this recommendation. In connection with the appointment, the\nBoard desired to add a Board member with extensive restaurant industry experience. Ms. Abell was referred to\nthe nominating and corporate governance committee by our corporate recruiter following a nationwide search.\nFollowing her initial referral for service as a director, Ms. Abell met extensively with management of the Company\nand our existing members of the Board prior to the nominating and corporate governance committee’s decision\nto recommend her appointment. Ms. Abell was nominated as a non-employee director because of her executive\nand board experience as well as her extensive knowledge of the restaurant industry where she has over 30\nyears of experience in the industry.\n24\nAs discussed above, the Board seeks diverse candidates, taking into account diversity in all respects\n(including gender, race, age, board service, background, education, skill set, and financial acumen, along with\nknowledge and experience in areas that are relevant to the Company’s business), when evaluating potential\nnominees. The chart below illustrates the composition of our Board nominees by gender, racial diversity, tenure,\nand core skills:\nBOARD DIVERSITY MATRIX AS OF MARCH 1, 2024\nTotal Number of Directors 9\nFemale Male Non-Binary Did Not Disclose\nPart 1: Gender Identity\nDirectors 3 6 — —\nPart 2: Demographic Background\nAfrican American or Black — 1 — —\nAlaskan Native or Native American — — — —\nAsian — — — —\nHispanic or Latinx — — — —\nNative Hawaiian or Pacific Islander — — — —\nWhite 3 5 — —\nTwo or More Races or Ethnicities — — — —\nLGBTQ+ — — — —\nDid Not Disclose Demographics — — — —\n1 – 5 6 – 10 >10\nYears Years Years\nPart 3: Tenure\nDirectors 5 1 3\nRestaurant Hospitality/Retail International Finance/Risk Technology\nPart 4: Core Skills\nDirectors 4 6 3 4 2\nCompensation of Directors\nAs further discussed in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” the compensation committee and\nmanagement of the Company did not utilize specific market targets when establishing the compensation for the\nnon-employee directors but utilized Equilar (the Company’s external executive and director compensation\ndatabase aggregator) to review non-director compensation of peer companies as a reference to establish non-\ndirector compensation. This review was used in establishing the fixed dollar amount on service based restricted\nstock units granted to our non-employee directors more particularly described below. Similar to our\ncompensation philosophy for our executive officers, we believe that issuing service based restricted stock units\nto our non-employee directors aligns their interests with those of our shareholders. Specifically, since the bulk\nof each non-employee director’s compensation lies in the value of the service based restricted stock units\ngranted, the non-employee directors are motivated to continually improve the Company’s performance in the\nhope that the performance will be reflected by the stock price on the vesting date of their service based restricted\nstock units. Moreover, we believe that the service based restricted stock unit awards drive director alignment\nwith maximizing shareholder value because the value of the service based restricted stock units varies in\nresponse to investor sentiment regarding overall Company performance at the time of vesting.\n25\nAs described more fully below, the following table summarizes the total compensation earned for fiscal\nyear 2023 for each of the non-employee directors.\n2023 Director Compensation Table\nGrant Date\nFees Earned Fair Value of\nor Paid in Stock Awards\nName Cash ($) ($)(1) Total ($)\nMichael A.

Zarley 69,000 (7) 224,448 293,448\n(1) The compensation committee agreed that with respect to (i) the Chairman of the Board’s 2023\nfiscal year service, he received an annual grant of service based restricted stock units equal to\n$313,000 divided by the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant, with such\nquotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares; and (ii) for each remaining non-\nemployee director’s 2023 fiscal year service, each received an annual grant of service based\nrestricted stock units equal to $223,000 divided by the closing sales price of the Company’s\ncommon stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding\nthe date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares.\nExcept as more particularly described below in footnote (3) for Mr. Jones, all service based\nrestricted stock units described in this paragraph were granted on January 8, 2023 and vested\non January 8, 2024 in accordance with the terms of a previously approved restricted stock unit\nagreement.\nFor the service based restricted stock units described in footnote (1) (other than for Mr. Jones),\nfair value is equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, which was $93.52 for the grants to the non-\nemployee directors. Using the formula described in the immediately foregoing paragraph of\nfootnote (1), Mr. Moore, as Chairman of the Board, was granted 3,300 service based restricted\nstock units for his 2023 fiscal year service, and each remaining non-employee director (other\nthan Mr. Jones) was granted 2,400 service based restricted stock units for their respective 2023\nfiscal year service. The amounts listed above represent the grant date fair value determined in\naccordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 718 (“ASC 718”) of restricted stock units granted under the Company’s 2021 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan. Detailed information under ASC 718 is set forth in Note 14 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 26, 2023. No other equity awards were granted to the non-employee directors\nduring the period of time covered by this table. The Company cautions that the amounts reported\nin the Director Compensation Table for these awards may not represent the amounts that the\nnon-employee directors will actually realize from the awards. Whether, and to what extent, a\nnon-employee director realizes value will depend on fluctuation in the Company’s stock price\nand the non-employee director’s continued service on the Board.\nAdditionally, the total compensation for any non-employee director may not exceed $500,000,\nwhich amount shall be calculated by adding (i) the total cash compensation to be paid for\nservices rendered by a non-employee director in any given fiscal year to (ii) the grant date value\nof any equity granted to such non-employee director in that fiscal year. This cap on Board total\ncompensation is included in the Company’s 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n26\n(2) This amount includes the $25,000 annual fee for serving as the chairperson of the audit\ncommittee.\n(3) Upon Mr. Jones’s appointment to the Board on June 2, 2023, he was granted 1,200 service\nbased restricted stock units, which represents the prorated amount of service based restricted\nstock units granted to the other non-employee directors on January 8, 2023 as described in\nfootnote (1) above. The fair value is equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock\non the trading day immediately preceding the grant, which was $109.41 for the grant to\nMr. Jones. These service based restricted stock units vested on January 8, 2024.\n(4) This amount includes the $75,000 annual fee for serving as the Chairman of the Board.\n(5) This amount includes the $10,000 annual fee for serving as the chairperson of the nominating\nand corporate governance committee.\n(6) This amount includes a prorated amount of the annual fee for serving as a member of the audit\ncommittee for the period of time in which Ms. Widmer served on the audit committee during the\n2023 fiscal year.\n(7) This amount includes the $10,000 annual fee for serving as the chairperson of the compensation\ncommittee.\nThe compensation committee established that all non-employee directors would receive the following\ncash and stock compensation relating to their 2023 fiscal year service:\n(i) each non-employee director received a base fee of $35,000;\n(ii) the Chairman of the Board received a fee of $75,000;\n(iii) the chairperson of the audit committee received a fee of $25,000;\n(iv) the chairperson of the compensation committee received a fee of $10,000;\n(v) the chairperson of the nominating and corporate governance committee received a fee of\n$10,000;\n(vi) each member of the audit committee received a fee of $10,000;\n(vii) each member of the compensation committee received a fee of $7,000;\n(viii) each member of the nominating and corporate governance committee received a fee of $7,000;\n(ix) the non-employee directors no longer received a fee for meeting attendance;\n(x) the Chairman of the Board received an annual grant of service based restricted stock units equal\nto $313,000 divided by the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq\nGlobal Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant, with such\nquotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares; and\n(xi) each remaining non-employee director received an annual grant of service based restricted\nstock units equal to $223,000 divided by the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock\non the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the\ngrant, with such quotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares.\n27\nAdditionally, the compensation committee established that all non-employee directors will receive the\nfollowing cash and stock compensation relating to their 2024 fiscal year service:\n(i) each non-employee director will receive a base fee of $35,000;\n(ii) the Chairman of the Board will receive a fee of $75,000;\n(iii) the chairperson of the audit committee will receive a fee of $25,000;\n(iv) the chairperson of the compensation committee will receive a fee of $10,000;\n(v) the chairperson of the nominating and corporate governance committee will receive a fee of\n$10,000;\n(vi) each member of the audit committee will receive a fee of $10,000;\n(vii) each member of the compensation committee will receive a fee of $7,000;\n(viii) each member of the nominating and corporate governance committee will receive a fee of\n$7,000;\n(ix) the non-employee directors will not receive a fee for meeting attendance;\n(x) the Chairman of the Board will receive an annual grant of restricted stock units equal to $320,000\ndivided by the closing sales price on January 7, 2024 on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with\nsuch quotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares, which was $118.30.

These service\nbased restricted stock units will vest on January 8, 2025.\nCode of Conduct\nCompany Code of Conduct. The Board has approved and adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to\nall directors, officers and employees, including the Company’s principal executive officer and the principal\nfinancial officer. We are committed to Passion, Partnership, Integrity and Fun… All with Purpose! The Code of\nConduct is our guide as we apply these core values in our treatment of our fellow employees and how we run\nour business. Our Code of Conduct also encompasses our principles and practices relating to the ethical\nconduct of the Company’s business and commitment to complying with all laws affecting the Company’s\nbusiness.\n28\nWe take all reported concerns or possible violations of our Code of Conduct seriously and will promptly\nand thoroughly investigate each reported concern as confidentially as possible. The Code of Conduct establishes\nthree separate ways in which any person may submit confidential and anonymous reports of suspected or actual\nviolations of the Code of Conduct. If an individual files a report, then the concerns will be directed to the\nappropriate personnel for investigation. We do not retaliate against any person who raises questions, reports\nconcerns, or who participates in an investigation related to the Code of Conduct.\nThe Code of Conduct is available in its entirety on the Company’s website at www.texasroadhouse.com.\nThe Company will post on its website any amendments to, or waivers from, its Code of Conduct, if any, that\napply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or\npersons performing similar functions.\nVendor Expectations. In addition to the Company’s Code of Conduct, the Company has established\nvendor expectations setting forth our expectations regarding our relationship with our vendors, including the\nmanner in which our vendors conduct their business, the manner in which they treat their employees, and our\nexpectation that our vendors will comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to their business\noperations including those laws prohibiting the use of forced labor or the facilitation of slavery and human\ntrafficking. Our vendor expectations are available in their entirety on the Company’s website at\nwww.texasroadhouse.com.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nOur Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines to further align the financial interests of the\nCompany’s executive officers and non-employee directors with the interests of our shareholders. During 2023,\nthe guidelines provided that our Chief Executive Officer should own, at a minimum, the lesser of 100,000 shares\nor $2,500,000 in then-current market value, our President should own, at a minimum, the lesser of 40,000 shares\nor $1,000,000 in then-current market value, and our other executive officers and non-employee directors should\nown, at a minimum, the lesser of 10,000 shares or $500,000 in then-current market value. The executive officers\nand non-employee directors were expected to achieve the stock ownership levels under these guidelines within\nfive years of assuming their respective positions and the Company evaluated the compliance with these stock\nownership guidelines at the end of each fiscal year. All executive officers and non-employee directors who have\nbeen in their role for five years were in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines at the end of fiscal\n2023.\nOn February 22, 2024 and following an annual review of our corporate governance practices, the Board\nupdated the stock ownership guidelines to provide for the following: (A) our Chief Executive Officer should own,\nat a minimum, five (5) times the then-current amount of his or her annual base salary, (B) our President should\nown, at a minimum, four (4) times the then-current amount of his or her annual base salary, (C) all other Named\nExecutive Officers should, own, at a minimum, three (3) times the then-current amount of his or her annual base\nsalary, and (D) each non-employee director should own, at a minimum, the greater of (i) five (5) times the then-\ncurrent amount of annual Board cash compensation received by each non-employee director, or (ii) $500,000 in\nthen-current market value. Similar to the Board’s prior stock ownership guidelines, the executive officers and\nnon-employee directors are expected to achieve the stock ownership levels under these guidelines within five\nyears of assuming their respective positions. The Company evaluates the compliance with these stock\nownership guidelines at the end of each fiscal year and it will be calculated based on the Company’s closing\nstock price on the last trading day of the applicable fiscal year.\n29\nSuccession Planning\nThe Board and the Company recognize the importance of continuity of leadership to ensure a smooth\ntransition for its employees, guests, and shareholders. In furtherance of the foregoing and as described in its\ncharter, the nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for periodically reporting to the\nBoard the status of succession planning for senior management, including guidance regarding succession in the\nevent of an emergency or retirement and the evaluation of potential successors to the executive officers and\nother key members of senior management. As a part of this process, both the Board and the nominating and\ncorporate governance committee meet with certain members of management to review the top and emerging\ntalent internally, their level of readiness, and development needs.\nMandatory Retirement Age for Board Service\nIn November 2019, the Board and the nominating and corporate governance committee determined that\nit is advisable and in the best interest of the Company to establish a mandatory retirement age for the non-\nemployee directors on the Board. In furtherance of the foregoing, in no event shall any non-employee be elected,\nre-elected, and/or appointed to the Board if such non-employee is 75 years or older at the time of such election,\nre-election, and/or appointment; provided, however, any director who began serving on the Board prior to 2006\nshall be permitted to be re-elected to the Board so long as they are not 80 years or older at the time of such re-\nelection.\nIn furtherance of this policy, Mr. Zarley is being nominated for re-election for the last time at the Annual\nMeeting. Mr. Zarley is our longest tenured member of the Board, being appointed to the Board in 2004 as a part\nof the Company’s initial public offering. He was appointed to the Board because of his chief executive and\ninformation technology experience in developing industries, his technology experience, and his transactional\nexperience. During his time on the Board, he has continued to serve on each of the three committees of the\nBoard and has provided both formal and informal mentorship and leadership, most recently as the chairperson\nof the compensation committee. The Company thanks Mr. Zarley for his almost 20 years of service to the Board\nand the tremendous value that he has brought to the Company during his tenure, including during key transitional\nmoments in the Company’s history (specifically following the sudden passing of our founder Kent Taylor).\nShareholder Engagement\nShareholder engagement is an important component of our overall approach to corporate governance.\nIt provides us the opportunity to update investors on our business as well as to receive feedback from them. Our\nInvestor Relations team serves as our primary point of contact with investors, potential investors, and investment\nanalysts. Additionally, throughout the year, members of our executive team, Board, and restaurant-level\noperators may participate in the investor dialogue.\nOur interaction with the investment community occurs in a number of ways, including one-on-one and\ngroup phone calls, analyst-sponsored conferences, our Annual Meeting, and our quarterly earnings calls. Topics\ndiscussed vary but typically include corporate strategy, financial results and outlook, new restaurant\ndevelopment, commodity and wage inflation, capital allocation, and various governance and corporate\nsustainability matters. Investor feedback and sentiment is shared with senior management and the Board on a\nregular basis.\nDuring 2023, management of the Company interacted with shareholders owning approximately 65% of\nthe outstanding shares of the Company as of the end of fiscal year 2023. These interactions ranged from one-\non-one phone/video calls, face-to-face meetings at investor conferences, video calls during virtual non-deal\nroadshows, participants listening to virtual fireside chats between members of management and sell-side\nanalysts, and conversations with stewardship teams regarding corporate governance.\n30\nBoard Orientation and Continuing Education\nThe Board believes that a thorough understanding of the Company’s business is required to enable a\ndirector to make a substantial contribution to the Board. As such, all new directors will participate in an orientation\nprogram within a reasonable period of time following such director’s initial appointment or election to the Board.\nThe orientation program may consist of meetings with senior management of the Company designed to\nfamiliarize each new director with the Company’s strategic plans, financial planning and key policies and\nprocedures as well as training within the Company’s restaurant facilities. Additionally, the Company, from time\nto time, may provide the Board with internal training programs or presentations from internal or outside third-\nparty experts on topics that will assist the directors in carrying out their Board responsibilities. Finally, the\ndirectors are encouraged to participate in continuing education and other programs provided by outside sources\nand to share any applicable learnings from such programs with the other directors on the Board. As a part of\nthe Board’s continued education, the directors on the Board annually complete the compliance trainings that are\nsimilar to those provided to certain employees. Further, the Company annually budgets a certain amount of\nfunding to reimburse directors for related costs to attend such programs.\nDirector Independence\nThe Board currently consists of nine directors – seven of whom are independent, as that term is defined\nin the listing standards under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2) and meet the criteria for independence under\nthe Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The\nnominating and corporate governance committee evaluates the relationships of each director and director\nnominee and makes a recommendation to the Board as to whether to make an affirmative determination that\nsuch director or director nominee is independent. In connection with such review, the nominating and corporate\ngovernance committee evaluates the relevant transactions or relationships between each director, or any of his\nor her family members, and the Corporation, its senior management and its independent auditors. In connection\nwith determining the directors to stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting (as more particularly described in\nProposal 1) and upon recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee, the Board has\naffirmatively determined that Messrs. Moore, Crawford, Jones and Warfield and Mses. Abell, Epps and Widmer\nare independent under the applicable criteria for service on the Board and the various Board committees upon\nwhich each serves (as and if applicable). The nominating and corporate governance committee determined that\nMr. Morgan is not independent due to his service as the Company’s principal executive officer and that Mr. Zarley\nis not independent due to his interest in a franchisee as described in “Related Party Transactions.”\n31\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION\nThe following table sets forth as of March 7, 2024 certain information with respect to the beneficial\nownership of the Company’s common stock of (i) each executive officer named in the Summary Compensation\nTable (the “Named Executive Officers”), (ii) each non-employee director or nominee for director of the\nCompany, (iii) all directors and current executive officers as a group, and (iv) each shareholder known by the\nCompany to be the owner of 5% or more of the Company’s common stock.\nSTOCK OWNERSHIP INFORMATION\nCommon Stock (1)\nCommon\nStock\nName Ownership Percent\nDirectors, Nominees and Named Executive Officers:\nJane Grote Abell — *\nMichael A.

Based solely on its review of such copies or written representations from\nreporting persons, the Company believes that all reports were filed on a timely basis during the fiscal year ended\nDecember 26, 2023 with the exception of a Form 4 for Mr. Humpich that was filed on January 10, 2024 relating\nto the acquisition of 743 service based restricted stock units received by Mr. Humpich on August 3, 2023 relating\nto his Q2 2022 service and the acquisition of 653 service based restricted stock units received by Mr. Humpich\non November 2, 2023 relating to his Q3 2022 service.\n33\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\n2023 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThe following is an executive summary of our compensation program for our 2023 fiscal year:\nCompensation Philosophy\nWe believe that our approach to the compensation program for our Named Executive Officers provides our\nNamed Executive Officers with a compensation package which promotes the sustained profitability of the\nCompany and aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our shareholders. The\ncompensation packages also reflect a pragmatic response to external market conditions; that is, total\ncompensation that is competitive with comparable positions in similar industries, including the casual dining\nsector of the restaurant industry, but which is reasonable and in the best interests of our shareholders.\nPay Objectives\nOur primary objective in setting and evaluating the compensation for our Named Executive Officers is to\npromote the sustained profitability of the Company. Our compensation program is designed to achieve this\nobjective in the following manner:\no The creation of a more direct relationship between the compensation for our Named Executive\nOfficers and shareholder value since a significant portion of our Named Executive Officer’s\nperformance based restricted stock units and cash bonuses are based upon the achievement of\ndefined performance goals to be established by the compensation committee.\no The attraction and retention of top talent, while also encouraging our Named Executive Officers to\nkeep their focus on both long-term business development and short-term financial growth.\no The featuring of service based restricted stock unit awards, the value of which is dependent upon\nthe performance of the Company and the price of our common stock.\no The opportunity by the compensation committee to adjust a significant portion of the compensation\nfor the Named Executive Officers through the annual grant of service based restricted stock units\nand/or performance based restricted stock units to more accurately reflect the overall performance\nof the Company.\nKey Pay Components\nThe compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers are divided into the following three key\ncomponents:\no Base Salary: Designed to provide a secure base of compensation and serve to motivate and retain\nour Named Executive Officers.\no Cash Bonus: Designed to reward our Named Executive Officers for the success of the Company as\nmeasured by growth in the Company’s earnings per diluted share and its overall pre-tax profit, and\nfor each Named Executive Officer’s individual contribution to that success.\no Restricted Stock Unit Grants: Designed to offer the Named Executive Officers a financial interest in\nthe long-term success of the Company and align their interests with those of our shareholders.\n34\nThe compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers may include the following types of restricted\nstock units:\no Service Based Restricted Stock Units, which grant the Named Executive Officers the conditional right\nto receive shares of our common stock that vest after a defined period of service;\no “Retention” Restricted Stock Units, which vest upon the completion of the term of an individual\nNamed Executive Officer’s agreement or such longer date as determined by the compensation\ncommittee; and\no Performance Based Restricted Stock Units, which are calculated based on the achievement of\ncertain Company performance targets established by the compensation committee and vest over a\nperiod of service.\nOur Board has adopted stock ownership guidelines to further align the financial interests of the Company’s\nexecutive officers with the interests of our shareholders. The guidelines previously provided that our Chief\nExecutive Officer should own, at a minimum, the lesser of 100,000 shares or $2,500,000 in then-current\nmarket value, our President should own, at a minimum, the lesser of 40,000 shares or $1,000,000 in\nthen-current market value, and our other executive officers should own, at a minimum, the lesser of 10,000\nshares or $500,000 in then-current market value. On February 22, 2024 and following an annual review of\nour corporate governance practices, the Board updated the stock ownership guidelines to provide for the\nfollowing: (A) our Chief Executive Officer should own, at a minimum, five (5) times the then-current amount\nof his or her annual base salary, (B) our President should own, at a minimum, four (4) times the then-current\namount of his or her annual base salary, (C) all other Named Executive Officers should, own, at a minimum,\nthree (3) times the then-current amount of his or her annual base salary, and (D) each non-employee director\nshould own, at a minimum, the greater of (i) five (5) times the then-current amount of annual Board cash\ncompensation received by each non-employee director, or (ii) $500,000 in then-current market value. The\nexecutive officers are expected to achieve these levels within five years of assuming their respective\npositions. The Company evaluates the compliance with these stock ownership guidelines at the end of each\nfiscal year and it will be calculated based on the Company’s closing stock price on the last trading day of the applicable\nfiscal year. All executive officers who have been in their role for five years are in compliance with these stock\nownership guidelines. We anticipate that any people who are new to their roles within the last five years will,\nto the extent they are not currently in compliance, be in compliance with the guidelines within the established\ntime frame.\nSetting Compensation\nThe compensation program for our Named Executive Officers is determined by the compensation committee.\nThe compensation committee evaluates the stock compensation for each Named Executive Officer on an\nannual basis to determine the right combination of rewards and incentives through the issuance of service\nbased restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units to drive company performance\nwithout encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk taking by all of the Named Executive Officers as a whole.\nPursuant to its charter, the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain or obtain advice from\na compensation consultant to assist in the establishment of executive compensation for each Named\nExecutive Officer.\nExecutive Employment Agreements\nAs more particularly described below, the Company and certain Named Executive Officers entered into new\nExecutive Employment Agreements at the beginning of fiscal year 2021. Under the Executive Employment\nAgreements, the compensation committee has established the following compensation for our Named\nExecutive Officers:\no Base Salary: Each Executive Employment Agreement establishes an annual base salary for the term\nof the respective Executive Employment Agreements, with base salary increases being left to the\ndiscretion of the compensation committee.\n35\no Cash Bonus: Each Executive Employment Agreement provides an annual short-term cash incentive\nopportunity with a target bonus based on the achievement of defined goals to be established by the\ncompensation committee, with increases in the target bonus amount to be made at the discretion of\nthe compensation committee during the term of the Executive Employment Agreement.\no Restricted Stock Units: Each Executive Employment Agreement provides that the compensation\ncommittee may grant stock awards to the Named Executive Officers during the term of the respective\nExecutive Employment Agreements, the types and amounts of which are subject to the\ncompensation committee’s discretion based on their annual review of the performance of the\nCompany and of the individual Named Executive Officers. While the Company previously granted\nretention grants for our Named Executive Officers under prior employment agreements, the\ncompensation committee did not make any similar retention grants for the Named Executive Officers\nunder the Executive Employment Agreements. The compensation committee will evaluate whether\nor not to award retention grants in the future as a part of its annual evaluation of the compensation\npackages for the Named Executive Officers.\nExecutive Compensation\nDuring 2021 and pursuant to the authority granted under its charter, the compensation committee engaged\nFW Cook as an independent compensation consultant to advise the compensation committee on\ncompensation for the executive officers beginning with the 2022 fiscal year, together with analysis and\nservices related to such executive compensation. Specifically, the compensation committee asked the\nconsultant to provide market data, review the design of the executive compensation packages, and provide\nguidance on cash and equity compensation for the Company’s executive officers. Based in part on the\nrecommendation of our third party compensation consultant and the review of the market data provided to\nthe compensation committee, the total compensation package established for each Named Executive Officer\nfor their respective 2022 fiscal year service reflected a shift in the compensation breakdown among the base\nsalary, bonus and equity components to a more weighted emphasis on non-equity compensation as well as\na shift from a fixed number of service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock\nunits to a fixed dollar amount with respect to such service based restricted stock units. FW Cook does not\ncurrently provide any other services to the Company, and the compensation committee has determined that\nFW Cook has sufficient independence from us and our executive officers to allow FW Cook to offer objective\ninformation and/or advice. The compensation committee utilized this compensation philosophy and structure\nwhen establishing executive compensation for each executive officer’s 2023 fiscal year service and 2024\nfiscal year service, respectively.\nClawback Policy\nThe Company has established a clawback policy whereby the Company shall reasonably promptly recover\nthe Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received (as hereinafter defined) by an Executive Officer (as\nhereinafter defined) in accordance with the applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market and Rule 10D-1\nfollowing an Accounting Restatement (as hereinafter defined). In such an event, the compensation committee\nhas the discretion to determine the appropriate method of recovering such Erroneously Awarded\nCompensation Received, including, without limitation, requiring reimbursement of cash incentive-based\ncompensation, seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting of any equity-based awards, offsetting\nthe recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company, and/or cancelling outstanding\nvested or unvested equity awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to take\nsuch actions if the compensation committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and either the\ncommittee has determined that the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Company’s\nclawback policy would exceed the amount to be recovered or recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-\nqualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to\nmeet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.\n36\n2023 Financial Highlights\nThe following is an executive summary of our financial highlights from the 2023 fiscal year:\nHistoric Topline Revenue and Store Unit Growth\n• Over $4.6 billion in total revenue, an increase of 15.4% over the prior year\n• Comparable restaurant sales growth of 10.1% with average weekly sales at $143,837 of which\n$18,088 were from to-go sales\n• Opened a record 45 new systemwide locations including 30 company restaurants and 15 franchise\nrestaurants including the first 2 domestic franchise restaurants for Jaggers, our fast-casual concept\nKey Growth in Other Financial Metrics\n• Diluted Earnings Per Share growth of 14.3%\n• Net income growth of 13.0%\n• Income from operations growth of 10.6%\n• Store week growth of 5.8%\nAcquisition Growth\n• Acquired 8 domestic franchise restaurants\nReturn to Shareholders\n• Paid dividends of $147.2 million, or $0.55 per share, an increase of 20% over the prior year\n• Repurchased 455,026 outstanding shares of our common stock for $50.0 million\n37\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nBubba Who: Our Executive Officers\nGERALD L.

As one purpose of this discussion is to present\nthe compensation committee’s overall program and philosophy for executive compensation, we have generally\npresented the discussion as of the end of the prior fiscal year and as of the beginning of the current fiscal year.\nInitial Executive Compensation Under Executive Employment Agreements.\nWe entered into employment agreements with Gerald L. Morgan, Regina A. Tobin, D. Christopher\nMonroe, Christopher C. Colson, Hernan E. Mujica, Travis C. Doster, Tonya R. Robinson, and S. Chris Jacobsen,\neach of which are Named Executive Officers. As used herein, the employment agreements, as amended (as\nand if applicable), with Messrs. Morgan, Monroe, Colson, Mujica, and Jacobsen and Mss. Tobin and Robinson\nshall be referred to collectively as the “Executive Employment Agreements” and with respect to any Named\nExecutive Officer having an employment agreement, as a “Executive Employment Agreement”. As further\ndescribed below, the Company did not enter into an Executive Employment Agreement with Keith V. Humpich\nin connection with his service as interim Chief Financial Officer and/or principal accounting officer (as applicable).\nEach Executive Employment Agreement (other than with Mr. Doster) has an initial term expiring on\nJanuary 7, 2024 which automatically renews for successive one-year terms thereafter unless either party elects\n40\nnot to renew by providing written notice to the other party at least 60 days before expiration. Mr. Doster’s\nExecutive Employment Agreement has an initial term expiring on January 8, 2025 which automatically renews\nfor successive one-year terms thereafter unless either party elects not to renew by providing written notice to\nthe other party at least 60 days before expiration.\nAs more particularly described below, on January 5, 2023, the Company entered into a Separation\nAgreement and Release of Claims (the “Robinson Separation Agreement”) with Ms. Robinson relating to\nMs. Robinson’s retirement as Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective as of January 4, 2023.\nAdditionally and as more particularly described below, on August 3, 2023, the Company entered into a\nSeparation Agreement and Release of Claims (the “Jacobsen Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Jacobsen\nrelating to his resignation as Chief Marketing Officer of the Company effective as of August 3, 2023.\nEach Executive Employment Agreement establishes an annual base salary for the term of the respective\nExecutive Employment Agreement. During the term of the Executive Employment Agreement, base salary\nincreases are at the discretion of the compensation committee; provided, however, none of the Named Executive\nOfficer’s base salary may be decreased during the term of the Executive Employment Agreement except for\ndecreases that are applied generally to the other Named Executive Officers in an amount no greater than 10%\nover the prior year. Each Executive Employment Agreement also provides an annual short-term cash incentive\nopportunity with a target bonus based on the achievement of defined goals to be established by the\ncompensation committee, with increases in the target bonus amount to be made at the discretion of the\ncompensation committee during the term of the Executive Employment Agreement. In addition to cash\ncompensation, each Executive Employment Agreement provides that the compensation committee may grant\ncertain stock awards to the Named Executive Officers during the term of the respective Executive Employment\nAgreements, the types and amounts of which are subject to the compensation committee’s discretion based on\ntheir annual review of the performance of the Company and of the individual Named Executive Officers. As of\nthe date of this proxy statement and as more particularly described below, certain Named Executive Officers\nreceived an annual grant of service based restricted stock units relating to their 2023 year service and 2024 year\nservice, respectively. Additionally, certain Named Executive Officers received grants of performance based\nrestricted stock units relating to their 2023 year service and 2024 year service, respectively. Finally, while the\nCompany previously granted retention grants for our Named Executive Officers under their prior employment\nagreements, the compensation committee has not made any similar retention grants for the Named Executive\nOfficers under the Executive Employment Agreements. The compensation committee will evaluate whether to\ngrant additional retention grants in the future as a part of its annual evaluation of the compensation packages\nfor the Named Executive Officers.\nUnder the Executive Employment Agreements, each Named Executive Officer has agreed not to\ncompete with us during the term of his or her employment and for a period of two years following his or her\ntermination of employment. Additionally, the Executive Employment Agreements include certain confidentiality,\nnon-solicitation, and non-disparagement provisions. Finally, the Executive Employment Agreement contains a\nsimilar “clawback” provision setting forth that any compensation paid or payable to the Executive Employment\nAgreement or any other agreement or arrangement with the Company shall be subject to recovery or reduction\nin future payments in lieu of recovery pursuant to any Company clawback policy in effect from time to time,\nwhether adopted before or after the date of the Executive Employment Agreement.\nThe Company has established a clawback policy whereby the Company shall reasonably promptly\nrecover the Erroneously Awarded Compensation Received by an Executive Officer in accordance with the\napplicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market and Rule 10D-1 following an Accounting Restatement. In such an\nevent, the compensation committee has the discretion to determine the appropriate method of recovering such\nErroneously Awarded Compensation Received, including, without limitation, requiring reimbursement of cash\nincentive-based compensation, seeking recovery of any gain realized on the vesting of any equity-based awards,\noffsetting the recouped amount from any compensation otherwise owed by the Company, and/or cancelling\noutstanding vested or unvested equity awards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required\nto take such actions if the compensation committee determines that recovery would be impracticable and the\ncompensation committee has determined that either (a) the direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in\nenforcing the Company’s clawback policy would exceed the amount to be recovered or (b) recovery would likely\n41\ncause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the\nCompany, to fail to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.\nFor the purposes of the clawback policy, (A) the term “Erroneously Awarded Compensation” means,\nwith respect to each Executive Officer in connection with an Accounting Restatement, the amount of Clawback\nEligible Incentive Compensation (as hereinafter defined) that exceeds the amount of incentive-based\ncompensation that otherwise would have been received had it been determined based on the restated amounts,\ncomputed without regard to any taxes paid; (B) the term “Clawback Eligible Incentive Compensation” means\nall incentive-based compensation received by an Executive Officer (i) on or after October 2, 2023, (ii) after\nbeginning service as an Executive Officer, (iii) who served as an Executive Officer at any time during the\napplicable performance period relating to any Incentive-based Compensation (whether or not such Executive\nOfficer is serving at the time the Erroneously Awarded Compensation is required to be repaid to the Company),\n(iv) while the Company has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange or a national securities\nassociation, and (v) during the applicable Clawback Period (as hereinafter defined); (C) the term “Clawback\nPeriod” means, with respect to any Accounting Restatement, the three completed fiscal years of the Company\nimmediately preceding the restatement date, and if the Company changes its fiscal year, any transition period\nof less than nine months within or immediately following those three completed fiscal years, provided that a\ntransition period of greater than nine months will be deemed a completed fiscal year; (D) the term “Accounting\nRestatement” means an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company with any\nfinancial reporting requirement under the securities laws, including any required accounting restatement to\ncorrect an error in previously issued financial statements that is material to the previously issued financial\nstatements (a “Big R” restatement), or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in\nthe current period or left uncorrected in the current period (a “little r” restatement); and (E) the term “Executive\nOfficer” means each individual who is currently or was previously designated as an “officer” of the Company as\ndefined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act.\nExecutive Compensation Starting With 2022 Fiscal Year.\nDuring 2021 and pursuant to the authority granted under its charter, the compensation committee\nengaged FW Cook as an independent compensation consultant to advise the compensation committee on\ncompensation for the executive officers beginning with the 2022 fiscal year, together with analysis and services\nrelated to such executive compensation. Specifically, the compensation committee asked the consultant to\nprovide market data, review the design of the executive compensation packages, and provide guidance on cash\nand equity compensation for the Company’s executive officers. As a part of this review, the chairperson of the\ncompensation committee, the independent compensation consultant and management of the Company agreed\non a list of the following 14 peer companies to evaluate their executive compensation:\nPEER COMPANIES\nBJ’s Restaurants, Inc. Bloomin Brands, Inc. Brinker International, Inc.\nChipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Darden Restaurants, Inc.\nInc.\nDave & Buster’s Entertainment, Denny’s Corporation Dine Brands Global, Inc.\nInc.\nJack in the Box Inc. Papa John’s International, Inc. Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc.\nThe Cheesecake Factory The Wendy’s Company\nIncorporated\nBased in part on the recommendation of our third party compensation consultant and the review of the\nmarket data provided to the compensation committee, the total compensation package established for each\nNamed Executive Officer for their respective 2022 fiscal year service reflected a shift in the compensation\nbreakdown among the base salary, bonus, and equity components to a more weighted emphasis on non-equity\ncompensation as well as a shift from a fixed number of service based restricted stock units and/or performance\nbased restricted stock units to a fixed dollar amount with respect to such service based restricted stock units.\nThe compensation committee utilized this compensation philosophy and structure when establishing executive\ncompensation for each applicable Named Executive Officer’s 2023 fiscal year service and 2024 fiscal year\n42\nservice, respectively. FW Cook does not currently provide any other services to the Company, and the\ncompensation committee has determined that FW Cook has sufficient independence from us and our executive\nofficers to allow FW Cook to offer objective information and/or advice.\nWith respect to establishing executive compensation for the 2023 fiscal year and 2024 fiscal year,\nrespectively, the compensation committee and management of the Company utilized the services of Equilar (the\nCompany’s external executive and director compensation database aggregator) to review the executive\ncompensation by continuing to review the same peer companies listed in the table above. Equilar does not\ncurrently provide any other services to the Company, and the compensation committee has determined that\nEquilar has sufficient independence from us and our executive officers to allow them to offer objective information\nand/or advice.\nSummary of Executive Compensation\nThe compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers offer base salaries and target cash\nbonus amounts and feature restricted stock unit awards, the value of which is dependent upon the performance\nof the Company and the price of our common stock. Such packages for our Named Executive Officers are\ncomprised of the following four main components (three of which are expressly tied to the performance of the\nCompany):\n(i) Base Salary: An annual base salary for the term of the respective Executive Employment\nAgreements, with base salary increases being left to the discretion of the compensation\ncommittee;\n(ii) Incentive Based Cash Bonus: An annual short-term cash incentive with a target bonus based\non the achievement of defined goals to be established by the compensation committee, with\nincreases in the target bonus amount to be made at the discretion of the compensation\ncommittee during the term of the Executive Employment Agreement;\n(iii) Service Based Restricted Stock Units: Restricted Stock Units which grant the Named Executive\nOfficer the conditional right to receive shares of our common stock that vest after a defined\nperiod of service, the realized value of which shall be dependent on the performance of the\nCompany upon the vesting of such restricted stock units; and\n(iv) Performance Based Restricted Stock Units: Restricted Stock Units that are calculated based on\nthe achievement of certain Company performance targets established by the compensation\ncommittee and vest over a period of service, the realized value of which shall be dependent on\nthe performance of the Company upon the vesting of such restricted stock units and the\nsatisfaction of such performance targets.\nThe compensation committee evaluates the stock compensation for each specific Named Executive\nOfficer on an annual basis to determine the right combination of rewards and incentives through the issuance of\nservice based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units to drive company\nperformance without encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk taking by all of the Named Executive Officers\nas a whole. Under this approach, the Named Executive Officers receive a combination of service based restricted\nstock units and performance based restricted stock units. Additionally and by conditioning a significant portion\nof the Named Executive Officer’s performance based restricted stock unit grants upon the achievement of\ndefined performance goals to be established by the compensation committee, combined with the stock\nownership guidelines for our Named Executive Officers more particularly described above, we have created a\nmore direct relationship between compensation and shareholder value. Moreover, by giving the compensation\ncommittee the discretion to grant certain stock awards (if any) in its discretion to our Named Executive Officers\nunder the Executive Employment Agreements, the compensation committee has the opportunity to adjust a\nsignificant portion of the total compensation for the Named Executive Officers on an annual basis to more\naccurately reflect the overall performance of the Company, which may include the issuance of service based\nrestricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units. Overall, we believe this approach provides\nthe Named Executive Officers with a compensation package which promotes the sustained profitability of the\n43\nCompany and aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our shareholders. The\ncompensation packages also reflect a pragmatic response to external market conditions; that is, total\ncompensation that is competitive with comparable positions in similar industries, including the casual dining\nsector of the restaurant industry, but which is reasonable and in the best interests of our shareholders.\nWe believe that the overall design of the compensation packages, along with the culture and values of\nour Company, allows us to attract and retain top talent, while also keeping the Named Executive Officers focused\non both long-term business development and short-term financial growth.\nIn deciding to continue and modify many of our existing executive compensation practices, our\ncompensation committee considered that the holders of approximately 91% of the votes cast at our 2023 annual\nmeeting on an advisory basis approved the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the\nproxy statement for the 2023 annual meeting. None of the Named Executive Officers, including Mr. Morgan,\nparticipated in the creation of their own compensation packages.\nElements of Compensation\nBase Salary. Base salaries for our Named Executive Officers are designed to provide a secure base of\ncompensation which will be effective in motivating and retaining key executives.\nEach Named Executive Officer’s Executive Employment Agreement provides that the compensation\ncommittee will establish the annual base salary for the Named Executive Officers at the commencement of the\nterm of their respective Executive Employment Agreement. Pursuant to each Named Executive Officer’s\nExecutive Employment Agreement, the compensation committee established an annual base salary for each\nNamed Executive Officer. During the term of the respective Executive Employment Agreement, base salary\nincreases are at the discretion of the compensation committee. In furtherance of the foregoing, the compensation\ncommittee established the annual base salary for each Named Executive Officer for the 2023 fiscal year as\nshown below.\nBase Salary for 2023 Fiscal Year under Executive Employment Agreements\nStarting\nJanuary 8, 2023 ($)\nGerald L.

Incentive bonuses are designed to reward our Named Executive Officers for the\nsuccess of the Company, as measured by growth in the Company’s earnings per diluted share (“EPS”) and\noverall pre-tax profit, and for each Named Executive Officer’s individual contribution to that success. It is our\nbelief that a significant amount of each Named Executive Officer’s compensation should be tied to the\nperformance of the Company.\nUnder the compensation committee’s charter, the compensation committee may award an annual cash\nincentive to the Named Executive Officers, which is the grant of a right to receive a payment of cash that is\nsubject to targets and maximums, and that is contingent on achievement of performance objectives during the\nCompany’s fiscal year. These cash incentives are also subject to the terms and conditions of the Executive\nEmployment Agreements and reflect each Named Executive Officer’s job responsibilities and individual\ncontribution to the success of the Company.\nIn furtherance of the foregoing, the compensation committee established a two-pronged approach to\ntying the incentive compensation to the Company’s performance. Under this approach, 50% of the target\nincentive bonus is awarded based on whether the Company achieves an annual EPS growth target of 10% (the\n“EPS Performance Goal”). The other 50% is based on a profit sharing pool (the “Profit Sharing Pool”)\ncomprised of 1.75% of the Company’s pre-tax profits (income before taxes less net income attributable to\nnon-controlling interests, as reported in our audited consolidated financial statements), which pool is distributed\namong our Named Executive Officers and certain other members of the Company’s director-level management\nbased on a pre-determined percentage interest in the pool and subject to certain pre-determined maximum\namounts. After the end of the fiscal year, the compensation committee determines whether and to what extent\nthe EPS Performance Goal has been met, and the portion of the Profit Sharing Pool to which each Named\nExecutive Officer is entitled. Depending on the level of achievement of the EPS Performance Goal each year,\n50% of the incentive bonus may be reduced to a minimum of $0 or increased to a maximum of two times the\ntarget amount. Each 1% change from the EPS Performance Goal results in an increase or decrease of 10% of\nthe portion of the target bonus amount attributable to the achievement of the EPS Performance Goal. For\nexample, if we achieve 11% EPS growth, the bonus payable would be 110% of the portion of the target bonus\nattributable to the achievement of the EPS Performance Goal. Conversely, if we achieve 9% EPS growth, the\nbonus payable would be 90% of the portion of the target bonus attributable to the achievement of the EPS\nPerformance Goal. The remaining 50% of the Named Executive Officers’ incentive bonus will fluctuate directly\nwith Company pre-tax profits at fixed participation percentages and maximum amounts which are determined\nwithin 60 days following the commencement of the Company’s fiscal year.\nThe annual profit sharing component allows the Named Executive Officers to participate in a profit\nsharing pool with other members of the Company’s director-level management team. By allowing this level of\nparticipation in the Company’s overall profits, the compensation committee encourages responsible growth and\naligns the interests of the Named Executive Officers with those of other management employees of the\nCompany. This portion of the incentive bonus may be reduced to a minimum of $0 if the Company ceases to be\nprofitable or for other reasons that the compensation committee determines, and may be increased to a\nmaximum of two times the target amount established for each individual participant. Both portions of the incentive\nbonus can be adjusted downward (but not upward) by the compensation committee in its discretion.\nCash incentive bonuses with respect to fiscal year 2023 were paid at 127.3% of the total target amount\nfor the fiscal year in which a Named Executive Officer served in such role, based on an increase in actual EPS\n46\nof 14.3% and an actual Profit Sharing Pool of $6,116,701 calculated on fiscal year 2023 pre-tax profit of\n$349,525,785.\nEach Executive Employment Agreement provides an annual short-term cash incentive opportunity with\na target bonus as set forth in the table below, with increases in the target bonus amount to be made at the\ndiscretion of the compensation committee. During the term of each respective Executive Employment\nAgreement, the performance criteria and terms of bonus awards are at the discretion of the compensation\ncommittee as described above. As further described above, depending on the level of achievement of the goals,\nthe bonus may be reduced to a minimum of $0 or increased to a maximum of two times the base target amount\nunder the current incentive compensation policy of the compensation committee of the Board.\nIn connection with the foregoing, the compensation committee established an annual short-term cash\nincentive opportunity with a target bonus as set forth in the table below relating to each Named Executive\nOfficer’s 2023 fiscal year service. The performance criteria and terms of bonus awards are at the discretion of\nthe compensation committee. As more particularly described above, the compensation committee continued its\ntwo pronged approach with 50% of the target incentive bonus being based on whether the Company achieves\nan annual EPS growth target of 10% and the remaining 50% being based on a Profit Sharing Pool comprised of\n1.75% of the Company’s pre-tax profits (income before taxes less net income attributable to non-controlling\ninterests, as reported in our audited consolidated financial statements). As further described above, depending\non the level of achievement of the goals, the bonus may be reduced to a minimum of $0 or increased to a\nmaximum of two times the base target amount under the current incentive compensation policy of the\ncompensation committee of the Board.\nExecutive Incentive Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023\nTarget Minimum Maximum\nBonus Bonus Bonus\n($) ($) ($)\nGerald L.

However, Mr. Humpich\ndid receive a target bonus of $200,000 with respect to his service as Vice President of Finance\nof the Company. His target bonus is subject to the same targets as the Named Executive\nOfficers except his bonus can be reduced to a minimum of 50% or increased to a maximum of\n150% of the base target amount.\n(3) As described above, Ms. Robinson retired as Chief Financial Officer of the Company on\nJanuary 4, 2023. As such, the compensation committee did not establish a target bonus for\nMs. Robinson for the 2024 fiscal year.\n(4) As described above, Mr. Jacobsen resigned as the Chief Marketing Officer for the Company on\nAugust 3, 2023. As such, the compensation committee did not establish a target bonus for\nMr. Jacobsen for the 2024 fiscal year.\nStock Awards. We make equity awards in the form of restricted stock units, which represent the\nconditional right to receive one share of our common stock upon satisfaction of the vesting requirements.\nRestricted stock units offer the Named Executive Officers a financial interest in the Company and align their\ninterests with those of our shareholders. We also believe that the market price of our publicly traded common\nstock represents the most appropriate metric for determining the value of the equity portion of our Named\nExecutive Officers’ compensation packages. The overall compensation packages for our Named Executive\nOfficers offer base salaries and target cash bonus amounts and feature restricted stock unit awards. While the\ninitial grant of restricted stock unit awards is based on a fixed dollar amount, the ultimate value of the restricted\nstock unit awards is dependent upon the performance of the Company and the price of our common stock at the\ntime such restricted stock units vest. The compensation committee evaluates the stock compensation for each\nspecific Named Executive Officer on an annual basis to determine the right combination of rewards and\nincentives through the issuance of service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted\nstock units to drive company performance without encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk taking by all of\nthe Named Executive Officers as a whole. Under this approach, the Named Executive Officers receive a\ncombination of service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units, with a\nsignificant portion of some of the Named Executive Officer’s compensation being tied to the grant of such\nperformance based restricted stock units. We believe that the service based restricted stock awards are\ninherently performance based since their value varies in response to investor sentiment regarding overall\nCompany performance at the time of vesting. Moreover, by giving the compensation committee the discretion to\ngrant certain stock awards (if any) in its discretion to our Named Executive Officers under the Executive\nEmployment Agreements, the compensation committee has the opportunity to adjust a large portion of the total\ncompensation for the Named Executive Officers on an annual basis to more accurately reflect the overall\nperformance of the Company, which may include the issuance of service based restricted stock units and/or\nrestricted stock units based on the achievement of defined goals to be established by the compensation\ncommittee for any and/or all of our Named Executive Officer. While the Company previously granted retention\ngrants for our Named Executive Officers under their respective prior employment agreements, the Executive\nEmployment Agreements do not include any similar retention grants. The compensation committee will evaluate\nwhether to grant additional retention grants in the future as a part of its annual evaluation of the compensation\npackages for the Named Executive Officers.\nIn addition, the Executive Employment Agreements with our Named Executive Officers permit the\ncompensation committee to grant in its discretion any combination of service based restricted stock units and/or\nperformance based restricted stock units for any portion of the term of the Executive Employment Agreements.\nFor the performance based awards that have or may be granted to the Named Executive Officers, the\ncompensation committee has established a two-pronged approach which mirrors the approach used for annual\ncash incentive bonuses. Under this approach, a percentage of the target equity award is based on whether the\nCompany achieves the annual EPS Performance Goal, and a percentage is based on the Profit Sharing Pool\ncomprised of 1.75% of the Company’s pre-tax profits (income before taxes less net income attributable to\n49\nnon-controlling interests, as reported in our audited financial statements). After the end of the fiscal year, the\ncompensation committee determines whether and to what extent the EPS Performance Goal has been met, and\nthe portion of the Profit Sharing Pool to which each officer is entitled. Each 1% change from the EPS\nPerformance Goal results in an increase or decrease of 10% of the portion of the target amount attributable to\nthe achievement of the EPS Performance Goal. For example, if we achieve 11% EPS growth, the number of\nshares awarded would be 110% of the portion of the target amount attributable to the achievement of the EPS\nPerformance Goal. Conversely, if we achieve 9% EPS growth, the award would be 90% of the portion of the\ntarget amount attributable to the achievement of the EPS Performance Goal. The remaining percentage of the\nNamed Executive Officers’ equity award will fluctuate directly with Company pre-tax profits at fixed participation\npercentages and maximum amounts which are determined within 60 days following the commencement of the\nCompany’s fiscal year. Both portions of the performance based equity award may be reduced to a minimum of\n$0 or increased to a maximum of two times the target amount for each individual participant. Both portions of\nthe performance based equity award can also be adjusted downward (but not upward) by the compensation\ncommittee in its discretion.\nPerformance based equity awards with respect to fiscal year 2023 were paid at 127.3% of the total target\namount for the fiscal year in which a Named Executive Officer served in such role, based on an increase in\nactual EPS of 14.3% and an actual Profit Sharing Pool of $6,116,701 calculated on fiscal year 2023 pre-tax profit\nof $349,525,785. For discussion of the percentages assigned by the compensation committee to each\ncomponent of the performance based equity awards for Messrs. Morgan, Monroe, Colson, and Mujica, and\nMs. Tobin (as applicable), refer to the associated tables below.\nThe total number of service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units\ngranted to each Named Executive Officer reflects each Named Executive Officer’s job responsibilities and\nindividual contribution to the success of the Company.\n50\nService Based Restricted Stock Units. Each Executive Employment Agreement provides that the\ncompensation committee may grant certain stock awards to the Named Executive Officers during the term of\nthe respective Executive Employment Agreements. In connection with the same, the compensation committee\nauthorized the grant of service based restricted stock units under each Executive Employment Agreement equal\nto the dollar amount described in the table below for each Named Executive Officer with respect to all or a portion\nof their 2023 fiscal year service. These service based restricted stock units were calculated by dividing the dollar\namount described in the table below by the per share closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant, with such\nquotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares. Additionally and except as described in the\nfootnotes below with respect to the grant of service based restricted stock units to Mr. Monroe and Mr. Doster\n(respectively), these service based restricted stock units were granted on January 8, 2023 and vested on\nJanuary 8, 2024.\nService Based Restricted Stock Units for 2023 Fiscal Year\nService Based Restricted Number of Service Based\nStock Units Vesting on Restricted Stock Units Vesting\nJanuary 8, 2024 pursuant on January 8, 2024 pursuant\nto Executive to Executive\nEmployment Agreements ($) Employment Agreements (1)\nGerald L.

These are not amounts paid to or received by the Named\nExecutive Officers. The amounts listed above represent the grant date fair value determined in\naccordance with ASC 718 of restricted stock units granted under the Company’s 2021 Long-\nTerm Incentive Plan. Detailed information under ASC 718 is set forth in Note 14 to the\nconsolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nthe fiscal year ended December 26, 2023. The Company cautions that the amounts reported in\nthe table above for these awards may not represent the amounts that the Named Executive\nOfficers will actually realize from the awards. Whether, and to what extent, a Named Executive\nOfficer realizes value will depend on the Company’s actual operating performance, stock price\nfluctuations and the Named Executive Officer’s continued service with the Company.\n(2) Upon Mr. Monroe’s appointment to Chief Financial Officer, the compensation committee\nauthorized the grant of 2,300 service based restricted stock units with a grant date of June 28,\n2023 for his partial 2023 fiscal year service and with a vesting date of December 31, 2024,\nprovided he is still employed as of the vesting date. The number of service based restricted\nstock units were calculated by dividing $250,000 by $109.32 (which was the closing sales price\nof the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on June 27, 2023), with\n51\nsuch quotient being rounded up or down to the nearest 100 shares.

Each Executive Employment Agreement provides that the\ncompensation committee may grant certain stock awards to the Named Executive Officers during the term of\nthe respective Executive Employment Agreements.

Morgan, Monroe, Colson, Mujica, and Jacobsen and\nMs. Tobin under their respective Executive Employment Agreements for their respective 2023\nfiscal year service in the following manner:\n(i) With respect to Mr. Morgan, his 13,900 performance based restricted stock units were\ncalculated by dividing $1,300,000 by $93.52 (which was the closing sales price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or\ndown to the nearest 100 shares);\n(ii) With respect to Ms. Tobin, her 4,300 performance based restricted stock units were\ncalculated by dividing $400,000 by $93.52 (which was the closing sales price of the\n54\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or\ndown to the nearest 100 shares);\n(iii) With respect to Mr. Monroe, his 1,400 performance based restricted stock units were\ncalculated by dividing $150,000 by $109.32 (which was the closing sales price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or\ndown to the nearest 100 shares);\n(iv) With respect to Mr. Colson, his 3,200 performance based restricted stock units were\ncalculated by dividing $300,000 by $93.52 (which was the closing sales price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or\ndown to the nearest 100 shares);\n(v) With respect to Mr. Mujica, his 3,200 performance based restricted stock units were\ncalculated by dividing $300,000 by $93.52 (which was the closing sales price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or\ndown to the nearest 100 shares); and\n(vi) With respect to Mr. Jacobsen, his 4,300 performance based restricted stock units were\ncalculated by dividing $400,000 by $93.52 (which was the closing sales price of the\nCompany’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the trading day\nimmediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or\ndown to the nearest 100 shares).\n(2) The shares underlying the performance based restricted stock units attributable to the 2023\nfiscal year were issued on February 23, 2024. The compensation committee determined that\n50% of the performance based restricted stock unit award for the 2023 fiscal year would be\nbased on an EPS growth target of 10%, which portion would be reduced or increased by 10%\nfor every 1% of annual growth in EPS less than or in excess of the 10% goal, and that 50% of\nthe performance based restricted stock unit award for the 2023 fiscal year would be based on a\npre-tax profit target opportunity equal to the percentage payout of 1.75% of pre-tax earnings\ndivided by the bonus pool target set by the compensation committee for the performance period.\n(3) As described above, the target number of performance based restricted stock units granted to\nMr. Monroe reflected his partial 2023 fiscal year service as the Company’s Chief Financial\nOfficer commencing on June 28, 2023 and continuing to and through December 26, 2023.\n(4) As described above, Mr. Doster was appointed Chief Communications Officer of the Company\non November 9, 2023. In connection with Mr. Doster’s appointment he was not awarded any\nperformance based restricted stock units with respect to his 2023 fiscal year service.\n(5) Mr. Humpich was not granted any performance based restricted stock units in connection with\nhis service as interim Chief Financial Officer during the 2023 fiscal year.\n(6) As described above, Ms. Robinson retired as Chief Financial Officer of the Company on\nJanuary 4, 2023. As such, Ms. Robinson was not granted any performance based restricted\nstock units with respect to the 2023 fiscal year.\n(7) As described above, Mr. Jacobsen resigned as Chief Marketing Officer of the Company on\nAugust 3, 2023. Upon his resignation, Mr. Jacobsen forfeited his right to receive the 4,300\nperformance based restricted stock units relating to his 2023 fiscal year service.\n55\nThe compensation committee authorized the grant of performance based restricted stock units as\ndescribed in the table below to Messrs. Morgan, Monroe, Colson, Mujica, and Doster and Ms. Tobin under their\nrespective Executive Employment Agreements for their respective 2024 fiscal year service. These performance\nbased restricted stock units will be calculated by dividing the target dollar amount described in the table below\nby the per share closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on\nthe trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant, with such quotient being rounded up or down to the\nnearest 100 shares. Additionally and except as described below with respect to Mr. Doster’s performance based\nrestricted stock units, these performance based restricted stock units were granted to each respective executive\nofficer on January 8, 2024 and will vest on January 8, 2025, subject to the achievement of defined goals\nestablished by the compensation committee of the Board. The actual number of shares that will be issued to\neach of Messrs. Morgan, Monroe, Colson, Mujica, and Doster and Ms. Tobin for fiscal year 2024 based on\nachievement of the performance goals assigned to these grants by the compensation committee will not be\ncalculated until the first quarter of 2025.\nPerformance Based Restricted Stock Units for 2024 Fiscal Year\nTarget\nPerformance Target Number\nBased Restricted Minimum Maximum of Performance\nStock Units Performance Performance Based Restricted\nvesting on Based Restricted Based Restricted Stock Units vesting on\nJanuary 8, 2025 Stock Units Stock Units January 8, 2025\npursuant to pursuant to pursuant to pursuant to\nExecutive Employment Executive Employment Executive Employment Executive Employment\nAgreements ($)(1) Agreements ($) Agreements ($) Agreements (2)\nGerald L.

The performance based restricted stock unit award for Messrs. Morgan,\nMonroe, Colson, Mujica, and Doster and Ms. Tobin with respect to fiscal year 2024 will be\ncertified in the first quarter of 2025.\n(2) Except as set forth in footnote (3) below, for the performance based restricted stock units\ndescribed in this footnote (2), fair value is equal to the closing price of the Company’s common\nstock on the trading day immediately preceding the date of the grant, which was $118.30 for\nthese grants. Using the formula described in the immediately foregoing paragraph prior to this\ntable, each Named Executive Officer was granted the target number of performance based\nrestricted stock units described in the table above for their respective 2024 fiscal year service.\nThese are not amounts paid to or received by these Named Executive Officers. The amounts\nlisted above represent the grant date fair value determined in accordance with ASC 718 of\nrestricted stock units granted under the Company’s 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Detailed\ninformation under ASC 718 is set forth in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements\nincluded in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26,\n56\n2023. The Company cautions that the amounts reported in the table above for these awards\nmay not represent the amounts that these Named Executive Officers will actually realize from\nthe awards.\n(3) Upon Mr. Doster’s appointment to Chief Communications Officer, the compensation committee\nauthorized the grant of 1,700 based restricted stock units with a grant date of November 9, 2023\nfor his 2024 fiscal year service and with a vesting date of January 8, 2025, subject to the\nachievement of defined goals established by the Compensation Committee of the Board set\nforth above. The number of performance based restricted stock units were calculated by dividing\n$175,000 by $103.41 (which was the closing sales price of the Company’s common stock on\nthe Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 8, 2023), with such quotient being rounded up\nor down to the nearest 100 shares. As described in footnote (2) above, these are not amounts\npaid to or received by Mr. Doster. The amounts listed above represent the grant date fair value\ndetermined in accordance with ASC 718 of restricted stock units granted under the Company’s\n2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n(4) As described above, Mr. Humpich’s service as the Company’s interim Chief Financial Officer\nended as of June 27, 2023 in connection with Mr. Monroe’s appointment to Chief Financial\nOfficer effective as of June 28, 2023. Mr. Humpich did not receive any grants of service based\nrestricted stock units for the 2024 fiscal year other than service based restricted stock units that\nwill be granted during the 2024 fiscal year in connection with his service as Vice President of\nFinance of the Company.\n(5) As described above, Ms. Robinson retired as Chief Financial Officer as of January 4, 2023. As\nsuch, she did not receive any grants of performance based restricted stock units for the 2024\nfiscal year.\n(6) As described above, Mr. Jacobsen resigned as Chief Marketing Officer as of August 3, 2023.\nAs such, he did not receive any grants of performance based restricted stock units for the 2024\nfiscal year.\nSeparation and Change in Control Arrangements\nThe Executive Employment Agreements generally provide that if a Named Executive Officer’s\nemployment is terminated during the term of the Executive Employment Agreement for a Qualifying Reason (as\ndefined below), the Company will pay the Named Executive Officer three months of base salary, unless the\ntermination occurs within 12 months following a Change in Control (as defined below), in which case the\napplicable Named Executive Officer’s current base salary remaining for the then existing term of his or her\nrespective Executive Employment Agreement will be paid. In addition, if any Named Executive Officer’s\ntermination occurs for a Qualifying Reason within 12 months following a Change in Control, the applicable\nNamed Executive Officer shall be paid any incentive bonus earned but not yet paid for any fiscal year ended\nbefore the date of termination, plus an incentive bonus for the year in which the date of termination occurs, equal\nto the applicable Named Executive Officer’s target bonus for that year, prorated based on the number of days in\nthe fiscal year elapsed before the date of termination. For purposes of the Executive Employment Agreements,\ntermination for a “Qualifying Reason” is generally defined to be attributable to one of the following: (i) the result\nof the applicable Named Executive Officer having submitted to the Company the Named Executive Officer’s\nresignation in accordance with a request by the Board or the Chief Executive Officer, provided that such request\nis not based on the Company’s finding that Cause (as defined below) for termination exists, (ii) a termination by\nthe Named Executive Officer for Good Reason (as defined below) within 12 months of a Change in Control, or\n(iii) a termination by the Company for any reason other than Cause or as a result of death or disability which\nentitles the Named Executive Officer to benefits under the Company’s long-term disability plan. Under the\nExecutive Employment Agreements, a termination by a Named Executive Officer (a separation, including a\nvoluntary retirement, initiated by a Named Executive Office other than per a request described above), other\nthan for Good Reason within 12 months following a Change in Control, shall not be a Qualifying Reason.\nAdditionally, termination for “Cause” means a termination by the Company for one or more of the following\nreasons: (a) a Named Executive Officer’s conviction of, or being charged with having committed, a felony; (b) a\n57\nNamed Executive Officer’s acts of dishonesty or moral turpitude that are detrimental to the business of the\nCompany; (c) a Named Executive Officer’s acts or omissions that such Named Executive Officer knew or should\nhave reasonably known were likely to damage the business of the Company; (d) a Named Executive Officer’s\nfailure to obey the reasonable and lawful directions of the Company, including, without limitation, the Company’s\npolicies and procedures (including the Company’s policies prohibiting discrimination, harassment, and\nretaliation), and the Texas Roadhouse, Inc. Code of Conduct; (e) a Named Executive Officer’s failure to perform\nsuch Named Executive Officer’s obligations under his or her Executive Employment Agreement; (f) a Named\nExecutive Officer’s willful breach of any agreement or covenant contained within his or her Executive\nEmployment Agreement or any fiduciary duty owed to the Company; and/or (g) a Named Executive Officer’s\nunsatisfactory performance of such Named Executive Officer’s duties after: (A) he or she has received written\nnotice of the general nature of the unsatisfactory performance, and (B) he or she has failed to cure the\nunsatisfactory performance within 30 days thereafter to the satisfaction of the Company.\nAs used in the Executive Employment Agreements, a “Change in Control” means that one of the\nfollowing events has taken place: (i) consummation of a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other\nentity, other than a merger or consolidation that would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding\nimmediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into\nvoting securities of the surviving or resulting entity) more than 50% of the combined voting power of the surviving\nor resulting entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; (ii) consummation of a sale or\ndisposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company (other than such a sale or disposition\nimmediately after which such assets will be owned directly or indirectly by the shareholders of the Company in\nsubstantially the same proportions as their ownership of the common stock of the Company immediately before\nsuch sale or disposition); or (iii) any Person becomes the beneficial owner (as determined pursuant to Section\n13(d) of the Exchange Act) of securities representing in excess of 50% of the aggregate voting power of the\noutstanding securities of the Company as required to be disclosed in a report on Schedule 13D of the Exchange\nAct. The Board has the full and final authority, in its sole discretion, to determine conclusively whether a Change\nin Control has occurred pursuant to the above definition, the date of the occurrence of such Change in Control,\nand any incidental matters relating thereto. The Executive Employment Agreements also provide for the\nreduction of Change in Control payments to the maximum amount that could be paid to the Named Executive\nOfficers without giving rise to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally,\nas used in the Executive Employment Agreements, “Good Reason” given by a Named Executive Officer in a\nnotice of termination must be based on: (a) the assignment to such Named Executive Officer of a different title\nor job responsibilities that result in a substantial decrease in the level of responsibility from those in effect\nimmediately before the Change in Control; (b) a reduction by the Company or the surviving company in such\nNamed Executive Officer’s base pay as in effect immediately before the Change in Control; (c) a significant\nreduction by the Company or the surviving company in total benefits available to such Named Executive Officer\nunder cash incentive, stock incentive and other employee benefit plans after the Change in Control compared\nto the total package of such benefits as in effect before the Change in Control; (d) the requirement by the\nCompany or the surviving company that such Named Executive Officer be based more than 50 miles from where\nsuch Named Executive Officer’s office is located immediately before the Change in Control, except for required\ntravel on company business to an extent substantially consistent with the business travel obligations which such\nNamed Executive Officer undertook on behalf of the Company before the Change in Control; or (e) the failure\nby the Company to obtain from any Successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or\notherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company an agreement to assume\nobligations under the Executive Employment Agreement.\n58\nWhile the individual Executive Employment Agreements do not address the manner in which unvested\nstock awards, if any, will be handled upon the termination of a Named Executive Officer, the specific restricted\nstock unit award agreement and/or performance restricted stock unit award agreement entered into by the\nNamed Executive Officers upon the grant of service based restricted stock units and/or performance based\nrestricted stock units provide that (A) if a Change in Control occurs prior to the vesting date of such restricted\nstock units and the Named Executive Officer is terminated by the Company without Cause, or (B) if the Named\nExecutive Officer is terminated for Good Reason within 12 months following a Change in Control, then such\nunvested service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units shall become\nvested as of the date of termination. Additionally, such specific restricted stock unit award agreement and/or\nperformance restricted stock unit award agreement entered into by the Named Executive Officers provide that if\nany Named Executive Officer’s continuous service is terminated because of death or disability prior to the vesting\ndate for the applicable grant of service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock\nunits (as and if applicable), then such applicable restricted stock units become immediately vested in an amount\nequal to the total number of granted restricted stock units multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the\nnumber of calendar months or portions thereof from grant date of such restricted stock units through the date on\nwhich such Named Executive Officer’s continuous service is terminated due to death or disability and the\ndenominator of which is the total number of calendar months or portion thereof in the vesting period for such\nrestricted stock unit grants.\nThe Company provides these severance payments to allow for a period of transition and are generally\ncontingent upon the Named Executive Officer’s execution of a full release of claims against the Company, and\ncontinued compliance with the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other restrictive covenants.\nIf the Named Executive Officer’s employment is terminated for any reason other than a Qualifying Reason (such\nas the officer’s death, disability or for Cause), then the Company will pay to the Named Executive Officer only\nthe base salary accrued for the last period of actual employment and any accrued paid time off in accordance\nwith policies of the Company in effect from time to time. The salary component of the severance payments is\nsubject to deductions and withholdings and is to be paid to the Named Executive Officers in periodic installments\nin accordance with our normal payroll practices. The fixed sum is paid in a single lump sum, and any bonus\ncomponent of the severance payments for a performance period that ended before termination is to be paid on\nthe same date as the payment would have been made had his or her employment not been terminated.\nThe estimated amounts that would have been payable to a Named Executive Officer under the Executive\nEmployment Agreements are more fully described in “Termination, Change of Control and Change of\nResponsibility Payments.”\nAdditionally, the Company announced that Ms. Robinson had retired as Chief Financial Officer of the\nCompany effective as of January 4, 2023. On January 5, 2023, the Company entered into the Robinson\nSeparation Agreement with Ms. Robinson. Under the Robinson Separation Agreement, the Company agreed to\npay to Ms. Robinson an aggregate sum of $3,500,000 (less any applicable withholdings and/or deductions),\nwhich will be paid in three installments in accordance with the following schedule: (i) $1,500,000 due and payable\nno later than January 31, 2023; (ii) $500,000 due and payable on July 31, 2023; and (iii) $1,500,000 due and\npayable on January 31, 2024. The Robinson Separation Agreement also provided a general release of claims\nby Ms. Robinson and affirmed certain obligations under her Executive Employment Agreement, including,\nwithout limitation, obligations pertaining to confidentiality, non-competition, non-hire, and non-solicitation.\nFinally, the Board announced the resignation of Mr. Jacobsen as Chief Marketing Officer effective as of\nAugust 3, 2023. On August 3, 2023 and in connection with Mr. Jacobsen’s resignation from the Company, the\nCompany and Mr. Jacobsen entered into the Jacobsen Separation Agreement with Mr. Jacobsen. Under the\nJacobsen Separation Agreement, the Company agreed to pay (i) his salary and benefits (including, but not\nlimited to, the payment of his incentive bonus relating to the Q2 2023 fiscal year period ending on June 27, 2023)\nthrough August 3, 2023; (ii) a sum of $125,000 (less applicable withholdings) reflecting three months of his base\nsalary due and payable under his Executive Employment Agreement; and (iii) a one-time payment of $288,805\n(less applicable withholdings). The Jacobsen Separation Agreement also provided a general release of claims\nby Mr. Jacobsen and affirmed certain obligations under his Executive Employment Agreement, including, without\nlimitation, obligations pertaining to confidentiality, non-competition, non-hire, and non-solicitation\n59\nHedging and Pledging Policies\nThe Company has a stock trading policy that, among other things, prohibits all of our employees\n(including our executive officers) and our directors from engaging in speculative trading in the Company’s shares,\nwhich prohibition includes any arrangement by which a shareholder or option holder changes his or her economic\nexposure to changes in the price of the stock. Prohibited arrangements include buying standardized put or call\noptions, writing put or call options, selling stock short, buying or selling securities convertible into other securities,\nor merely engaging in a private arrangement where the value of the agreement varies in relation to the price of\nthe underlying security. Such arrangements are prohibited because these transactions may give the appearance\nof improper trades and look disloyal. In addition, our stock trading policy strongly discourages employees\n(including our executive officers) and our directors from holding the Company’s securities in a margin account\nor otherwise pledging these securities as collateral for a loan. As of the date of this proxy statement, none of our\nNamed Executive Officers and non-employee directors hold the Company’s securities in a margin account or\nhave otherwise pledged them as collateral for a loan.\nStipend for Interim Chief Financial Officer; Principal Accounting Officer\nIn connection with Mr. Humpich’s appointment to interim Chief Financial Officer on January 5, 2023, the\ncompensation committee agreed that he would receive a $100,000 stipend per fiscal quarter (or portion thereto)\nin which he serves in such position, which amount will be paid in arrears. In the event Mr. Humpich only serves\nas interim Chief Financial Officer for a portion of any given fiscal quarter, then the $100,000 per quarter stipend\nwill be prorated on a month-to-month basis. Additionally, in connection with Mr. Humpich’s continued service as\nthe Company’s principal accounting officer after June 28, 2023 following Mr. Monroe’s appointment as the\nCompany’s Chief Financial Officer, the compensation committee agreed that Mr. Humpich would continue to\nreceive a $100,000 stipend per fiscal quarter (or portion thereto) in which he continues to serve in such position\nthrough the end of the 2023 fiscal year, which amount will be paid in arrears. Commencing with the 2024 fiscal\nyear, Mr. Humpich no longer receives such $100,000 quarterly stipend.\nSigning Bonus for D. Christopher Monroe\nPursuant to Mr. Monroe’s Executive Employment Agreement and in connection with his appointment to\nChief Financial Officer, the Company agreed to pay to Mr. Monroe a one-time signing bonus in the amount of\n$500,000. The signing bonus will be paid in two equal installments of $250,000 each in the following manner: (i)\nthe first installment was due and payable on or before July 1, 2023, and (ii) the second installment was due and\npayable on or before January 1, 2024.\nCompensation Committee Report\nThe compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis”\nrequired by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the\ncompensation committee recommended to the Board that the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” be\nincluded in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 26, 2023.\nAll members of the compensation committee concur in this report.\nMichael A.

In connection with our Annual Report on Form 10-\nK for the year ended December 28, 2021, December 27, 2022 and December 26, 2023, the\nCompany presented a performance graph by comparing our cumulative TSR against the S&P\nComposite 1500 Restaurant Sub-Index (the “S&P Index”). For the purposes of the table above,\nwe have shown the TSR for the Company’s peer companies using the S&P Index. In\nfurtherance of the foregoing, using the S&P Composite 1500 Restaurant Sub-Index, the TSR of\n76\nthe Company’s peer companies increased 18.9% in fiscal year 2020, increased 22.6% in fiscal\nyear 2021, decreased 7.9% in fiscal year 2022, and increased 15.1% in fiscal year 2023.\nAs shown in the charts as discussed further below, the relationship between the Compensation Actually\nPaid to the Principal Executive Officer and the Average Compensation Actually Paid to the Non-Principal\nExecutive Officers in the 2020 fiscal year, 2021 fiscal year, 2022 fiscal year, and 2023 fiscal year, respectively,\nto each of (i) net income, (ii) total shareholder return, and (iii) diluted earnings per share demonstrates that such\ncompensation fluctuates to the extent the Company is achieving its goals and increasing value for shareholders\nin line with the Company’s compensation philosophy and performance-based objectives. For the purposes of\nthe charts below, the Principal Executive Officer is determined in the following manner: (i) for fiscal year 2020,\nthe Principal Executive Officer represented is W. Kent Taylor, (ii) for fiscal year 2021, the Principal Executive\nOfficer represented is the aggregate compensation of W. Kent Taylor and Gerald L. Morgan, and (iii) for fiscal\nyears 2022 and 2023 the Principal Executive Officer represented is Gerald L.

To identify our median employee, we used the 2023 total cash compensation\nfor all individuals (other than Mr. Morgan, our Chief Executive Officer) who were employed by us as of\nDecember 26, 2023, the last day of our 2023 fiscal year. For the purposes of calculating our employee’s total\ncash compensation, we used our employee’s base wages identified on our employees’ W-2 forms. As a part of\nour calculation, we included all employees, whether employed by us on a full-time or part-time basis, and we\nannualized the compensation of any employee whom we hired during our 2023 fiscal year and who was working\nfor us at the end of our fiscal year. As of December 26, 2023, approximately 74% of our employees were part-\ntime employees and our average employee worked approximately 18 hours per week.\nWe identified our median employee as a server in Rockwall, Texas who worked an average of\napproximately 20 hours per week. After identifying our median employee, we calculated the annual total\ncompensation for such employee as $18,523, which is determined using the same methodology we used for our\nNamed Executive Officers as set forth in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table described above.\nAs more particularly described in the 2023 Summary Compensation Table, the annual total\ncompensation for Mr. Morgan, our Chief Executive Officer, for our 2023 fiscal year is $5,347,527 and the ratio\nbetween the compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and the compensation for our median employee is\n289 to 1. Note that since the SEC rules allow companies to use various methodologies and assumptions, apply\ncertain exclusions, and make reasonable estimates relating to a specific company’s employee base when\nidentifying the median employee, the CEO pay ratio disclosed by other companies may not be comparable with\nthe CEO pay ratio disclosed in this paragraph. Additionally, the pay ratio between our Chief Executive Officer\nand our median employee may vary year to year based, in part, on the grant date value of any restricted stock\nunits granted to our Chief Executive Officer in any given year.\n79\nAUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT\nAs of the date of this proxy statement, the audit committee of the Board (the “Committee”) is currently\ncomposed of five directors, all of whom meet the criteria for independence under the applicable Nasdaq and\nSecurities & Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) rules and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Committee acts under\na written charter adopted by the Board, a copy of which is available on the Company’s website at\nwww.texasroadhouse.com.

During the 2024 fiscal year, the\nCommittee is comprised of Ms. Epps and Messrs. Crawford, Jones, Moore, and Warfield. Ms. Epps currently\nserves as the chairperson of the Committee and was the chairperson of the Committee during the 2023 fiscal\nyear. The Board evaluated the credentials of and designated Ms. Epps and Messrs. Moore and Warfield as audit\ncommittee financial experts.\nThe Committee has prepared the following report on its activities and with respect to the Company’s\naudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2023 (the “Audited Financial\nStatements”).\n• The Committee met 12 times during fiscal year 2023, which were comprised of six regular meetings\nof the Committee and six meetings solely related to the Committee’s review of the Company’s\nquarterly earnings release and filings with the SEC. The Committee’s meetings included private\nsessions with the Company’s independent auditors and internal auditors (as needed), as well as\nexecutive sessions consisting of only Committee members.

Policy for Pre-Approval of Services Provided by External Audit Firm\n(which is available on the Company’s website at www.texasroadhouse.com);\n• On a quarterly basis, the Committee discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed\nby the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board’s Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications\nwith Audit Committees;\n• The Committee discussed with KPMG LLP their written disclosures and letter required by the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor’s communications with\nthe Committee concerning independence;\n• The Committee reviewed the selection, application, and disclosure of critical accounting policies;\n• The Committee reviewed with KPMG LLP the selection and disclosure of the critical audit matter(s)\nset forth in the independent auditor’s report of the Company’s Form 10-K;\n• The Committee reviewed the Company’s quarterly earnings press releases prior to issuance;\n• The Committee reviewed and discussed the Company’s Audited Financial Statements for the 2023\nfiscal year with management and the independent auditors;\n• As mentioned above, the Committee reviewed the Company’s Quarterly and Annual Reports on\nForm 10-Q and Form 10-K prior to filing with the SEC and acknowledged that the Committee did\nnot have any objections to the filing of the same;\n• The Committee evaluated the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of KPMG LLP.\nIn connection with such appointment, the Committee evaluated the service level of the incumbent\nindependent auditor, which included criteria such as prior year quality of service, industry and\ntechnical expertise, independence, resource availability, and reasonableness and competitiveness\nof fees, as well as solicited the input of key management employees during its evaluation; and\n• Based on the review and discussion referred to above, and in reliance thereon, the Committee\nrecommended to the Board that the Audited Financial Statements be included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 26, 2023, for filing with the SEC.\nAll members of the Committee concur in this report.\nDonna E. Epps, Chair\nMichael A. Crawford\nWayne L. Jones\nGregory N. Moore\nCurtis A. Warfield\n81\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Committee’s charter provides that the Committee will review and approve any transactions between\nus and any of our executive officers, non-employee directors, and 5% shareholders, or any members of their\nimmediate families, in which the amount involved exceeds the threshold limits established by the regulations of\nthe SEC. In reviewing a related-party transaction, the Committee considers the material terms of the transaction,\nincluding whether the terms are generally available to an unaffiliated third party under similar circumstances.\nUnless specifically noted, the transactions described below were either entered into before our initial public\noffering in 2004 and the subsequent formation of the Committee or before the individual listed below became a\nNamed Executive Officer.\nGrants of Franchise or License Rights\nWe have franchised restaurants to companies owned in part by a Named Executive Officer. The royalty\nrate that is paid by these companies is set forth below, and is the amount we typically charge to franchisees. We\nbelieve that allowing certain Named Executive Officers to have ownership interests in our restaurants provides\nan ongoing benefit to the Company by these persons being more invested in the overall success of the brand.\nOwnership interests of franchised restaurants by Mr. Morgan as of the end of the 2023 fiscal year are\nlisted below. Note that the chart below denotes ultimate beneficial ownership percentages and Mr. Morgan may\nfrom time to time hold such interests through another legal entity such as a trust or limited liability company.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nManagement,\nRoyalties Supervision and/or\nPaid to Accounting Fees\nInitial Us in Paid to Us\nFranchise Royalty Fiscal Year 2023 in Fiscal Year 2023\nRestaurant Name and Ownership Fee Rate ($) ($)(1)\nEl Cajon, CA Gerald L.

Morgan (2.0%) — 4.0 % 466,456 30,366\n(1) The management, supervision and/or accounting fees described in this table are fees paid by\nthe operating entity of the applicable franchise location to the Company pursuant to a separate\nmanagement agreement.\nFor the 2023 fiscal year, the total amount of distributions received by Mr. Morgan relating to his\nownership interests in the above-referenced franchised restaurants was $150,214. This amount does not reflect\ncompensation paid by the Company to Mr. Morgan during the 2023 fiscal year; rather, this amount was paid by\nthe applicable franchise entity and reflects a return on investment in these separate restaurant locations.\nThe franchise agreements that we have entered into with this current Named Executive Officer contain\nthe same terms and conditions as those agreements that we enter into with our other Texas Roadhouse domestic\nfranchisees. We have the contractual right, but not the obligation, to acquire the restaurants owned in part by\nsuch Named Executive Officer based on a pre-determined valuation formula which is the same as the formula\ncontained in the Texas Roadhouse domestic franchise agreements that we have entered into with other\nfranchisees with whom we have such rights. Once a franchise agreement has been entered into, it may be\nterminated if the franchisee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the agreement, including\nits obligations to operate the restaurant in strict accordance with our standards and specifications. A franchise\nagreement may also be terminated if a franchisee becomes insolvent, fails to make its required payments,\ncreates a threat to the public health or safety, ceases to operate the restaurant or misuses the Texas Roadhouse\ntrademarks.\n82\nOwnership Interest in Majority-Owned Joint Venture Entities\nWe have a current Named Executive Officer, Gerald L. Morgan, who has an ownership interest in a\ncertain Texas Roadhouse restaurant that is owned by an entity that the Company controls and in which the\nCompany holds a 52.5% ownership interest. We believe that allowing certain Named Executive Officers to have\nownership interests in restaurants provides an ongoing benefit to the Company by making these persons more\ninvested in the overall success of the brand. As of the end of the 2023 fiscal year, Mr. Morgan held a 34.5%\nultimate beneficial ownership interest in the Mansfield, Texas restaurant, which such entity paid $384,319 to us\nfor management and supervision fees. Additionally, for the 2023 fiscal year, the total amount of distributions\nreceived by Mr. Morgan relating to his ownership interest in the Mansfield, Texas restaurant was $577,305. This\namount does not reflect compensation paid by the Company to Mr. Morgan during the 2023 fiscal year; rather,\nthis amount was paid by the entity and reflects a return on investment in this restaurant location.\nOther Related Transactions\nOn February 28, 2024, the Board and the Committee approved a related party transaction involving\nMr. Zarley’s ownership interest in a future Jaggers franchise entity as described herein. In connection with the\ntransaction, the Company will be entering into a development agreement with a third-party member-managed\nlimited liability company for the development of fifteen Jaggers franchise locations in Houston, Texas. Mr. Zarley\nis the beneficial owner of 20.0% of the franchise entity. Pursuant to the development agreement, the franchise\nentity will pay a $150,000 development fee to the Company and is required to pay to the Company a $45,000\nfranchise fee for every franchise location opened under the development agreement. Mr. Zarley agreed to\nguarantee certain obligations of the franchise entity to the Company under any franchise agreement entered into\nbetween the Company and such entity during the term of the development agreement. The franchise agreements\nwill contain the same terms and conditions as those agreements that we enter into with our other Jaggers\nfranchisees, with royalties generally at 5.0% of restaurant sales. As of the date of this proxy statement, Mr. Zarley\nhas not received any distributions relating to his ownership interest in the franchise entity; provided, however,\nany amounts paid to Mr. Zarley will not reflect compensation paid by the Company but such amounts will be paid\nby the franchise entity and will reflect a return on investment in these restaurant locations. Due to Mr. Zarley’s\nownership interest in such thirty party franchise entity, Mr. Zarley is no longer independent (as such term is\ndefined in the listing standards under Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5605(a)(2)). In connection with the approval of\nthis related party transaction, the Board and the Committee considered, among other things, that (i) Mr. Zarley\ndoes not serve on any of the Board committees, (ii) the Board remains composed by more than 75% of\nindependent directors, (iii) the fact that fiscal year 2024 is the last year in which Mr. Zarley will be nominated for\nre-election at the Annual Meeting, and (iv) the instrumental role that Mr. Zarley will continue to play in mentoring\nour newest members of the Board as he serves his final annual term under the Board’s age limit policy.\n83\nPRESENTATION OF PROPOSALS\nPROPOSAL 1\nELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nThe Company’s Bylaws provide for not less than one and not more than 15 directors. Our Board currently\nconsists of nine directors. At the Annual Meeting, we are electing nine directors to hold office until the Annual\nMeeting of Shareholders in 2025 and until a successor is elected and qualified. Although it is not anticipated that\nany of the nominees listed below will decline or be unable to serve, if that should occur, the proxy holders may,\nin their discretion, vote for a substitute nominee.\nNominees for Election as Directors\nSet forth below are the Board members who will stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting, together\nwith their age, all Company positions and offices they currently hold, and the year in which they joined the Board.\nNOMINEES FOR ELECTION AS DIRECTORS\nPosition or Director\nName Age Office Since\nJane Grote Abell 57 Director 2024\nMichael A.

Zarley 79 Director 2004\nRecommendation\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE ELECTION OF THE\nNOMINEES FOR THE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY SET FORTH ABOVE.\n84\nPROPOSAL 2\nRATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS\nAs more particularly described in this proxy statement, the audit committee is directly responsible for\nmanaging the Company’s independent auditors, which includes, without limitation, (i) pre-approving all audit and\npermitted non-audit services provided by our independent auditors, and (ii) the appointment, compensation,\nretention and oversight of the Company’s independent auditors. In connection with the audit committee’s\nappointment of the Company’s independent auditors, the audit committee evaluates the service level of the\nincumbent independent auditor on an annual basis, which includes criteria such as prior year quality of service,\nindustry and technical expertise, independence, resource availability, and reasonableness and competitiveness\nof fees, as well as solicits the input of key management employees during its evaluation.\nIn connection with the same and pursuant to its charter, the audit committee has appointed the firm of\nKPMG LLP to serve as the independent auditors to audit the consolidated financial statements and the internal\ncontrol over financial reporting of the Company for the fiscal year which ends on December 31, 2024. The Board\nand the audit committee jointly agree that the continued retention of KPMG LLP is in the best interest of the\nCompany and its shareholders. Accordingly, a resolution will be presented at the Annual Meeting to ratify the\nappointment of KPMG LLP. If the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, the audit committee\nwill take this result into account when appointing an independent auditor for the 2024 fiscal year. Even if the\nappointment is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent\nregistered public accounting firm as the Company’s independent auditors at any time during the year if the audit\ncommittee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. One\nor more representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the\nopportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.\nFees Paid to the Independent Auditors\nKPMG LLP FEES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2023 AND 2022\n2023($) 2022($)\nAudit Fees 857,797 913,816\nAudit-related Fees 16,000 16,000\nTax Fees 50,500 66,190\nAll Other Fees — —\n924,297 996,006\nAudit Fees.

As an advisory\nvote, the outcome of the voting on this Proposal 3 is not binding upon the Company; however, the compensation\ncommittee, which is responsible for establishing and administering the Company’s executive compensation\nprogram, values the opinions expressed by shareholders on this Proposal 3 and will consider the outcome of\nthe vote when making future compensation decisions for the Company’s executive officers. Additionally, the\ncompensation committee invites shareholders to express any questions or concerns regarding the Company’s\ncompensation philosophy for our executive officers by correspondence addressed to Texas Roadhouse, Inc.\nCompensation Committee, 6040 Dutchmans Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40205.\nThe objective of the compensation committee in setting and evaluating the compensation of our\nexecutive officers is to promote the sustained profitability of the Company. Compensation for the Named\nExecutive Officers is divided into three key components: (1) base salary, which provides a secure base of\ncompensation and serves to motivate and retain our Named Executive Officers; (2) a cash bonus, which rewards\nour Named Executive Officers for the success of the Company as measured by growth in the Company’s\nearnings per diluted share and its overall pre-tax profit, and for each Named Executive Officer’s individual\ncontribution to that success; and (3) grants of restricted stock units, which offer the Named Executive Officers a\nfinancial interest in the long-term success of the Company and align their interests with those of our\nshareholders. The types of restricted stock units that may be granted by the compensation committee in its\ndiscretion are (i) service based restricted stock units, which grant the Named Executive Officers the conditional\nright to receive shares of our common stock that vest after a defined period of service, (ii) “retention” restricted\nstock units, which vest upon the completion of the term of an individual Named Executive Officer’s agreement\nor such longer date as determined by the compensation committee, and (iii) performance based restricted stock\nunits, which are calculated based on the achievement of certain Company performance targets established by\nthe compensation committee and vest over a period of service. While “retention” restricted stock units were\ngranted by the compensation committee under the prior employment agreements, the compensation committee\nhas not made any similar retention grants for the Named Executive Officers under the Executive Employment\nAgreements. The compensation committee will evaluate whether to grant additional retention grants in the future\nas a part of its annual evaluation of the compensation packages for the Named Executive Officers.\nThe compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers offer base salaries and target cash\nbonus amounts and feature restricted stock unit awards. While the initial grant of restricted stock unit awards is\nbased on a fixed dollar amount, the ultimate value of such restricted stock unit awards is dependent upon the\nperformance of the Company and the price of our common stock at the time such restricted stock units vest.\nUnder the Executive Employment Agreements, the compensation committee has flexibility in establishing the\ncompensation for our Named Executive Officers. Specifically, each Executive Employment Agreement\nestablishes an annual base salary for the term of the respective Executive Employment Agreements, with base\nsalary increases being left to the discretion of the compensation committee. Additionally, each Executive\nEmployment Agreement provides an annual short-term cash incentive opportunity with a target bonus based on\nthe achievement of defined goals to be established by the compensation committee, with increases in the target\nbonus amount to be made at the discretion of the compensation committee during the term of the Executive\nEmployment Agreement. Finally and in addition to cash compensation, each Executive Employment Agreement\nprovides that the compensation committee may grant certain stock awards to the Named Executive Officers\nduring the term of the respective Executive Employment Agreements, the types and amounts of which are\nsubject to the compensation committee’s discretion based on their annual review of the performance of the\nCompany and of the individual Named Executive Officers.\nThe compensation committee evaluates the stock compensation for each specific Named Executive\nOfficer on an annual basis to determine the right combination of rewards and incentives through the issuance of\nservice based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units to drive company\nperformance without encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk taking by all of the Named Executive Officers\n87\nas a whole. Under this approach, the Named Executive Officers receive service based restricted stock units\nand/or performance based restricted stock units, with a significant portion of some of the Named Executive\nOfficers’ compensation being tied to the grant of such performance based restricted stock units. By conditioning\na significant portion of certain Named Executive Officer’s performance based restricted stock unit grants upon\nthe achievement of defined performance goals to be established by the compensation committee, combined\nwith the stock ownership guidelines for our Named Executive Officers more particularly described above, we\nhave created a more direct relationship between compensation and shareholder value. Additionally, by giving\nthe compensation committee the discretion to grant certain stock awards (if any) in its discretion to our Named\nExecutive Officers under their Executive Employment Agreements, the compensation committee has the\nopportunity to adjust a significant portion of the total compensation for the Named Executive Officers on an\nannual basis to more accurately reflect the overall performance of the Company, which may include the issuance\nof service based restricted stock units and/or performance based restricted stock units. Overall, we believe this\napproach provides the Named Executive Officers with a compensation package which promotes the sustained\nprofitability of the Company and aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our\nshareholders. The compensation packages also reflect a pragmatic response to external market conditions; that\nis, total compensation that is competitive with comparable positions in similar industries, including the casual\ndining sector of the restaurant industry, but which is reasonable and in the best interests of our shareholders.\nThis structure, along with the culture and values of our Company, allows the Company to attract and\nretain top talent, while also encouraging our Named Executive Officers to keep their focus on both long-term\nbusiness development and short-term financial growth. The Board was pleased to receive shareholder approval\nof the compensation packages of our Named Executive Officers in the advisory vote at the 2023 annual meeting\nand again requests approval of the compensation packages of our Named Executive Officers.\nRecommendation\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE EXECUTIVE\nCOMPENSATION DETAILED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.\n88\nPROPOSAL 4\nVOTE TO AMEND THE COMPANY’S\nAMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION\nTO REMOVE CLASS B SHARES\nGeneral\nWe are seeking approval to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate (as hereinafter defined) to\nremove any and all references to shares of $0.001 par value Class B Common Stock (“Class B shares”).\nBackground and Rationale for the Recommendation\nIn connection with the Company’s initial public offering, the Company executed the Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. dated October 4, 2004. We subsequently\namended such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation pursuant to the Amendment to Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. dated May 19, 2016 and such Amended and\nRestated Certificate of Incorporation and related amendment are collectively referred to herein as the “Amended\nand Restated Certificate.” Article IV of the Amended and Restated Certificate initially authorized the Company\nto issue 100,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Class A Common Stock (“Class A shares”) and 8,000,000\nClass B shares. The holders of our Class A shares and Class B shares generally had identical rights except that\n(1) on all matters to be voted on by our shareholders, holders of our Class A shares were – and currently still\nare – entitled to one vote per share, while holders of our Class B shares were entitled to 10 votes per share, and\n(2) holders of our Class A shares were not entitled to vote on any alteration of the powers, preferences or special\nrights of the Class B shares that would not adversely affect the holders of our Class A shares. Under Article IV,\nSection B(4) of the Amended and Restated Certificate, each share of Class B stock automatically converted into\none share of Class A stock upon the earliest of (i) the date such Class B shares ceased to be beneficially owned\nby W. Kent Taylor, (ii) the date that Mr. Taylor ceased to beneficially own at least 20% of the outstanding shares\nof the total shares of the Company, (iii) upon the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Taylor, or (iv)\nSeptember 30, 2009 (reflecting approximately five years following the completion of our initial public offering).\nAs of October 1, 2009, any and all outstanding Class B shares were converted into Class A shares, and,\naccordingly, as of the date of this proxy statement, there are no outstanding Class B shares and the Company\ndoes not have the authority to re-issue any Class B shares. In addition, pursuant to Article IV, Section A(4) of\nthe Amended and Restated Certificate, upon the conversion of all of the outstanding Class B shares into Class\nA shares, the Class A shares were automatically re-designated as “common stock.”\nIn connection with the Company’s annual review of its corporate governance practices, the Company\nand the Board regularly review our governing documents and consider possible changes. One such item that\nwas identified by the Company and the Board was the removal of any and all references to Class B shares in\nthe Amended and Restated Certificate. On February 22, 2024, the Board unanimously approved certain\nrevisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate to remove all references to Class B shares (subject to\napproval by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting). Given that the Company is unable to issue any additional\nClass B shares and there are no outstanding Class B shares as of the date of this proxy statement, the Board\ndetermined that the Class B share provisions are no longer necessary and could potentially lead to confusion\nwith our shareholders.\nFor the reasons stated above, the Board determined that the proposed revisions to the Company’s\nAmended and Restated Certificate are advisable and in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders\nand authorized and approved the proposed revisions to be considered at the Annual Meeting.\n89\nProposed Revisions to Article IV of our Amended and Restated Certificate\nArticle IV of the Amended and Restated Certificate currently references Class B shares that were\nauthorized and issued at the time of our initial public offering but have subsequently been converted into Class\nA shares, which were then re-designated as shares of common stock. As such, the references to Class B shares\nare no longer applicable and could inadvertently confuse our shareholders. Therefore, the Board determined\nthat the proposed revisions to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate set forth below are advisable\nand in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders and authorized and approved the proposed\nrevisions to be considered at the Annual Meeting.\nWe propose to amend Article IV of our Amended and Restated Certificate so that Article IV would state\nin its entirety as follows:\nARTICLE IV\nCapital Stock\nThe Corporation shall have the authority to issue One Hundred Million (100,000,000) shares of\n$0.001 par value Common Stock (the “Common Stock”), and One Million (1,000,000) shares of $0.001 par\nvalue Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). The number of authorized shares of any class or classes of\nstock may be increased or decreased (but not below the number of shares thereof outstanding) by the\naffirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to vote,\nirrespective of Del. Code Ann. tit. 8, Section 242(b)(2).\nA statement of the designations of each class and the powers, preferences and rights, and\nqualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof is as follows:\nA. Common Stock\n(1) Dividends. The holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends if, as and\nwhen declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.\n(2) Liquidation. In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of\nassets or winding-up of the Corporation, the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all the\nassets of the Corporation of whatever kind available for distribution to stockholders, after the rights of the\nholders of the Preferred Stock have been satisfied.\n(3) Voting. Each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share of Common\nStock held as of the applicable date on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the\nstockholders of the Corporation.\nB. Preferred Stock.\nThe Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors\nis expressly authorized, by resolution adopted and filed in accordance with law, to fix the number of shares\nin each series, the designation thereof, the powers (including voting powers, full or limited, if any), the\npreferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights thereof, and the qualifications or\nrestrictions thereon, of each series and the variations in such voting powers (if any) and preferences and\nrights as between series. Any shares of any class or series of Preferred Stock purchased, exchanged,\nconverted or otherwise acquired by the Corporation, in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and\ncancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof. All such shares shall upon their cancellation become\nauthorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock, without designation as to series, and may be reissued\nas part of any series of Preferred Stock created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, subject\nto the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth in this Certificate of Incorporation or in such resolution\nor resolutions.\n90\nProposed Revision to Article XII of our Amended and Restated Certificate\nArticle XII of the Amended and Restated Certificate currently references Class B shares that were\nauthorized and issued at the time of our initial public offering but have subsequently been converted into Class\nA shares, which were then re-designated as shares of common stock. As such, the references to Class B shares\nare no longer applicable and could inadvertently confuse our shareholders. Therefore, the Board determined\nthat the proposed revisions to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate set forth below are advisable\nand in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders and authorized and approved the proposed\nrevisions to be considered at the Annual Meeting.\nWe propose to amend Article XII of our Amended and Restated Certificate so that Article XII would state\nin its entirety as follows:\nARTICLE XII\nReservation of Rights\nThe Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision contained in\nthis Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner now or hereafter prescribed by the General\nCorporation Law of Delaware, and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted\nsubject to this reservation above.\nThe full text of the proposed amendment is set forth above and in Appendix A. In Appendix A,\nadditions are marked with bold, underlined text and deletions are indicated by struck- out text.\nTiming and Effect of Revisions to Amended and Restated Certificate\nIf our shareholders approve the amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate contemplated\nby Proposal 4, they will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment to our Amended and\nRestated Certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State, which we anticipate doing as soon as practicable\nfollowing shareholder approval of the Proposal 4. In addition, we intend to file an Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation to integrate the amendments to the Amended Restated Certificate discussed in\nProposals 4 and 5 (to the extent approved by the Corporation’s shareholders) into a single document. If the\nproposed changes to the Amended and Restated Certificate set forth in this Proposal 4 are not approved by our\nshareholders at the Annual Meeting, then our Amended and Restated Certificate will not be amended to remove\nreferences to Class B shares, and any references to Class B shares will remain in our Amended and Restated\nCertificate.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our common stock outstanding as of the Record Date\nand entitled to vote on Proposal 4 is required to approve this Proposal 4. As a result, abstentions and broker\nnon-votes will have the effect of a vote against this Proposal 4.\nRecommendation\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” TO PERMIT THE COMPANY\nTO AMEND THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO\nREMOVE ALL REFERENCES TO CLASS B SHARES.\n91\nPROPOSAL 5\nVOTE TO AMEND THE COMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED\nCERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO PROVIDE FOR\nEXCULPATION OF OUR OFFICERS AS PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW\nBackground\nThe State of Delaware, which is the Company’s state of incorporation, recently enacted legislation that\npermits Delaware corporations to limit the personal liability of certain of their officers for monetary damages\nassociated with claims of breach of the duty of care in limited circumstances under Section 102(b)(7) of the\nDelaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”). Previously, DGCL 102(b)(7) permitted corporations to limit\nthe personal liability of directors for monetary damages associated with breaches of the duty of care in limited\ncircumstances. However, the statute had not previously contemplated providing similar protection for officers.\nArticle VI of our Amended and Restated Certificate (as defined in Proposal 4) currently provides for the\nexculpation of directors from personal liability for monetary damages associated with breaches of the duty of\ncare, but our Amended and Restated Certificate does not have a similar limitation of personal liability for our\nofficers. With this new statutory amendment, Delaware corporations are now permitted to include an exculpation\nprovision in their certificates of incorporation to cover their officers as well, but only with respect to direct claims\nby shareholders for breach of an officer’s fiduciary duty of care, including, without limitation, class action lawsuits;\nprovided, however, such amendment would not allow for the elimination of an officer’s monetary liability for\nbreach of fiduciary claims brought by the Company itself or for derivative claims brought by shareholders in the\nname of the Company. Moreover and similar to what is set forth in Article VI of the Amended and Restated\nCertificate with respect to directors, the limitation of personal liability of our officers would not apply to breaches\nof the duty of loyalty to the Company or our shareholders, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve\nintentional misconduct or a knowing violation of the law, and/or any transaction in which the officer derived an\nimproper personal benefit. As permitted by the DGCL, the officers that would be exculpated under the revisions\nproposed in this Proposal 5 fall into three categories: (1) the Company’s president; chief executive officer; chief\noperating officer; chief financial officer; chief legal officer; controller; treasurer; or chief accounting officer; (2)\nindividuals who are or were identified in our public filings as the most highly compensated officers of the\nCompany; and (3) individuals who, by written agreement with the Company, consented to be identified as officers\nfor purposes of accepting service of process.\nIn connection with the Company’s annual review of its corporate governance practices, the Company\nand the Board identified the disparate treatment of the Company’s officers and the Company’s directors. Based\non the foregoing and the change in the DGCL, on February 22, 2024, the Board approved certain revisions to\nthe Amended and Restated Certificate more particularly shown below to amend Article VI of the Amended and\nRestated Certificate to provide for exculpation of the officers of the Company from personal liability for monetary\ndamages associated with claims of breach of the duty of care as is now permitted by the DGCL (subject to\nshareholder approval at the Annual Meeting). When evaluating its decision to approve such revisions to the\nAmended and Restated Certificate, the Board evaluated the benefits the Board believes would accrue to the\nCompany by providing such exculpation of its officers in accordance with DGCL Section 102(b)(7) including,\nwithout limitation, the ability to attract and retain key officers and the potential to reduce litigation costs associated\nwith frivolous lawsuits. The Board believes that these revisions to the Amended and Restated Certificate are in\nthe best interest of the Company and our shareholders and authorized and approved the proposed revisions to\nbe considered at the Annual Meeting.\n92\nProposed Revision to Article VI of Amended and Restated Certificate\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate currently provides for the exculpation of directors and does not\ninclude a provision allowing for the exculpation of officers. We propose to amend Article VI of our Amended and\nRestated Certificate so that it would state in its entirety as follows:\nNo director or officer of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its\nstockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer (as\napplicable); except for liability:(a) as a director or officer, for any breach of such director’s or\nofficer’s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders; (b) as a director or officer, for any\nacts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation\nof the law; (c) as a director, under Section 174 of the General Corporation Law of the State of\nDelaware; (d) as a director or officer, for any transaction from which the director and/or officer\n(as applicable) derived an improper personal benefit; or (e) as an officer, in any action by or in\nthe right of the corporation. If the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware shall be\namended to permit further elimination or limitation of the personal liability of directors and/or\nofficers (as applicable), then the liability of a director and/or officer (as applicable) of the\nCorporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the General\nCorporation Law of the State of Delaware as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this\nArticle VI by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection\nof a director and/or officer (as applicable) of the Corporation existing at the time of, or increase\nthe liability of any director and/or officer (as applicable) of the Corporation with respect to any\nacts or omissions occurring prior to, such repeal or modification.\nThe full text of the proposed amendment is set forth above and in Appendix B. In Appendix B,\nadditions are marked with bold, underlined text and deletions are indicated by struck- out text.\nRationale for Revisions to Amended and Restated Certificate\nThe DGCL has long permitted Delaware corporations to exculpate directors from certain personal\nliabilities for monetary damages associated with claims of breach of the duty of care in limited circumstances,\nand our Amended and Restated Certificate has included such an exculpation provision for directors in\naccordance with DGCL Section 102(b)(7). However, until 2022, when the changes to the DGCL were enacted,\nDelaware corporations were unable to provide similar protections to their officers – which caused unequal and\ninconsistent treatment of directors and officers associated with claims related to an alleged breach of the duty\nof care. In the course of the Company’s ongoing evaluation of the Company’s corporate governance practices,\nthe Board and the Company identified this disparate treatment, and after careful consideration, the Board\napproved certain revisions to the Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate to incorporate an exculpation\nprovision of our officers in our Amended and Restated Certificate in accordance with the DGCL (subject to\napproval by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting).\nThe Board believes that it is in the best interest of the Company and our shareholders to provide our\nofficers with the exculpatory protection from certain personal liabilities and expenses that is similar to what our\ndirectors are entitled to receive for monetary damages associated with claims of breach of the duty of care in\nlimited circumstances pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate. The nature of the role of directors\nand officers often requires them to make decisions on crucial matters. Frequently, directors and officers must\nmake decisions in response to time-sensitive opportunities and challenges, which can create a substantial risk\nof investigations, claims, actions, suits or proceedings seeking to impose liability on the basis of hindsight.\nWithout such exculpation protections, particularly amidst the recent trend of plaintiffs increasingly naming\ncorporate officers as defendants in shareholder litigation, our existing officers may be deterred from making such\nbusiness decisions that involve risk due to potential monetary liability for our business decisions and/or\nprospective officers may be deterred from serving as an officer of the Company. The Board also considered\nwhen approving such revisions to the Amended and Restated Certificate that many Delaware corporations have\nalready adopted exculpation clauses limiting the personal liability of their officers in their certificates of\nincorporation and that such exculpation of officers is only limited to claims arising from a breach of their\nrespective duty of care and such limitation of liability would not apply to breaches of the duty of loyalty to the\n93\nCompany or our shareholders, acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a\nknowing violation of the law, and/or any transaction in which the officer derived an improper personal benefit. In\naddition, the revised provision of the DGCL only permits, and our proposed revisions to the Amended and\nRestated Certificate, would only permit, exculpation for direct claims for officers (as opposed to derivative claims\nmade by stockholders on behalf of the Company).\nFor the reasons stated above, the Board determined that the proposed revisions to the Company’s\nAmended and Restated Certificate are advisable and in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders\nand authorized and approved the proposed revisions to be considered at the Annual Meeting. Please note that\nthe proposed revisions set forth in this Proposal 5 are not being proposed in anticipation or response to any\nspecific resignation, threat of resignation or refusal to serve by any officer nor is it being proposed in anticipation\nor response to any litigation or threat of litigation.\nTiming and Effect of Revisions to Amended and Restated Certificate\nIf our shareholders approve the amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate contemplated\nby this Proposal 5, they will become effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment to our Amended and\nRestated Certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State, which we anticipate doing as soon as practicable\nfollowing shareholder approval of this Proposal 5. In addition, we intend to file an Amended and Restated\nCertificate of Incorporation to integrate the amendments to the Amended Restated Certificate discussed in\nProposals 4 and 5 (to the extent approved by the Corporation’s shareholders) into a single document. If the\nproposed changes to the Amended and Restated Certificate set forth in this Proposal 5 are not approved by our\nshareholders at the Annual Meeting, then our Amended and Restated Certificate will not be amended to provide\nfor the exculpation of our officers.\nRequired Vote\nThe affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of\nthe Record Date and entitled to vote on Proposal 5 is required to approve this Proposal 5. As a result, abstentions\nand broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against this Proposal 5.\nRecommendation\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “FOR” THE AMENDMENT TO THE\nCOMPANY’S AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE TO PROVIDE FOR EXCULPATION OF OUR\nOFFICERS AS PERMITTED BY DELAWARE LAW.\n94\nPROPOSAL 6\nVOTE TO AMEND THE COMPANY’S BYLAWS TO REDUCE THE\nOWNERSHIP THRESHOLD REQUIRED FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO\nREQUEST A SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS\nGeneral\nWe are seeking approval to amend our Amended and Restated Bylaws of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (the\n“Bylaws”) to reduce the ownership threshold required for our shareholders to request a special meeting of\nshareholders from 50% to 25%, as more particularly described herein.\nBackground and Rationale for the Recommendation\nArticle II, Section 3 of our Bylaws currently provides that a special meeting of shareholders may only be\ncalled by our Board, the Chairman of the Board, our Chief Executive Officer or President, or by the Secretary at\nthe written request of the holders of at least 50% in voting power of all capital stock outstanding and entitled to\ncast vote at the meeting. Additionally, Article VII of our Amended and Restated Certificate and Article VIII of our\nBylaws provide that Article II, Section 3 may only be amended with the affirmative vote of the holders of at least\na majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Company issued and outstanding and entitled\nto vote.\nIn connection with the Company’s annual review of its corporate governance practices, the Company\nand the Board regularly review our governing documents and consider possible changes. One such item that\nwas identified by the Company and the Board was the ownership threshold required for our shareholders to\nrequest a special meeting of shareholders – which is also a topic that was raised on our routine calls with our\nshareholders as a part of our shareholder outreach program, as described earlier in this proxy statement.\nFollowing extensive discussion regarding the proposed reduction in the voting percentage, on February 22,\n2024, the Board approved certain revisions to our Bylaws more particularly shown below to modify Article II,\nSection 3 to reduce the ownership threshold required for our shareholders to request a special meeting of\nshareholders from 50% to 25% (subject to approval by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting). This reduction\nwill permit shareholders holding a sufficiently large voting interest in the Company to request a special meeting.\nWhen making this decision, the Board recognizes that lessening the conditions required for a shareholder of the\nCompany to request a special meeting enhances shareholder rights. However, the Board has to balance these\nenhanced shareholder rights against the risk that a small minority of shareholders, including shareholders with\nspecial interests that are not shared generally by the majority of our Company’s shareholders, could request that\nthe Company call special meeting(s) – which could result in unnecessary financial expense and disruption to the\nCompany’s business operations.\nFor the reasons stated above, the Board determined that the proposed revisions to the Company’s\nBylaws are advisable and in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders and authorized and\napproved the proposed revisions to be considered at the Annual Meeting.\n95\nProposed Revisions to Article II, Section 3 of our Bylaws\nAs noted above, Article II, Section 3 of our Bylaws currently provide that “[u]nless otherwise prescribed\nby law or by the Certificate of Incorporation, special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time and for\nany purpose, by the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President,\nor by the Secretary at the written request of the holders of at least 50% in voting power of all capital stock\noutstanding and entitled to cast votes at the meeting.” We propose to amend Article II, Section 3 of our Bylaws\nto reduce the applicable percentage threshold so that it would state in its entirety as follows:\nSection 3. SPECIAL MEETINGS.

Concurrently following the\nCompany’s receipt of the shareholder proposal from Boston Trust Walden Company, on November 22, 2023,\nthe Company received notice from the Trustee of the New York State Common Retirement Fund of its intention\nto co-file the following shareholder proposal with Boston Trust Walden Company. We will provide the proponents’\nrespective address and shareholdings (to our Company’s knowledge) to any shareholder promptly upon oral or\nwritten request made to Texas Roadhouse, Inc., c/o Christopher C. Colson, Corporate Secretary, 6040\nDutchmans Lane, Louisville, Kentucky 40205, (502) 426-9984. The text of the proponents’ joint resolution and\nsupporting statement appear below, printed verbatim from its submission. We disclaim all responsibility for the\ncontent of the proposal and the supporting statement, including sources referenced therein.\nShareholder Proposal\n“Whereas: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has advised that greenhouse gas (GHG)\nemissions must be halved by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050 to limit global warming to 1.5°C.\nEvery incremental increase in temperature above 1.5°C will entail increasingly severe physical and\ntransition risks to companies, investors, and the economy. Climate change mitigation is critical to\naddress investment risks and avert the economic losses projected if sufficient action is not taken.\nThe global food system contributes one third of global GHG emissions. Left unmitigated, these\nemissions can derail efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. The 2018 National Climate Assessment identified\nrising temperatures as “the largest contributing factor to declines in the productivity of U.S. agriculture”\nand noted that “climate change presents numerous challenges to sustaining and enhancing crop\nproductivity [and] livestock health.”\nWhile Texas Roadhouse has disclosed operational emissions and committed to disclosing supply chain\nemissions by the end of 2024, the Company has failed to mitigate climate-related financial risks by\ndisclosing a comprehensive strategy to reduce its total contribution to climate change. Food service\npeers—including Chipotle, McDonald’s, and Yum! Brands—are addressing a broad set of climate-\nrelated financial risks by setting and implementing 1.5°C-aligned science-based targets inclusive of their\nfull value chains.\nBy failing to proactively manage value chain emissions, Texas Roadhouse is contributing to incremental\nincreases in global temperature rise above 1.5°C, which will impact the Company’s access to critical\ncommodities, procurement and production costs,\nResolved: Shareholders request Texas Roadhouse issue a report, at reasonable cost and omitting\nproprietary information, describing if and how it plans to reduce its total GHG emissions and align its\nbusiness with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5°C.\n97\nSupporting Statement: Shareholders recommend the report disclose, at board and management\ndiscretion:\n• Paris-aligned short-, medium-, and long-term emissions reduction targets for the Company’s full\nGHG footprint, taking into consideration approaches used by advisory groups like the Science-\nBased Targets Initiative; and\n• a transition plan detailing how the Company intends to achieve such targets, including strategies\nfor mitigating physical and transition climate risks, taking into consideration criteria used by\nadvisory groups such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, CDP,\nTransition Plan Taskforce, and the We Mean Business Coalition.”\nBoard’s Opposition Statement\nAfter careful consideration, the Board unanimously recommends that the shareholders vote\nAGAINST this shareholder proposal.\nWe take corporate sustainability seriously and have been clear that our strategy is about progress, not\npromises. And as we describe below, we have made great progress in our sustainability efforts with what we\nbelieve to be a landmark year in 2023.\nOur historical business strategy entails making thoughtful business and risk assessments before making\nstrategic decisions or taking specific action. It is and always has been about taking a deliberate and methodical\napproach to our work. It is about educating ourselves on a particular topic by consulting with a number of experts\nacross different fields and disciplines to ensure that we have a full and complete view of the risk presented,\nfeasibility of options, and/or business opportunities available now or in the future. We believe that our studied\napproach of seeking to understand business opportunities before establishing an action plan (or, even further,\nmaking public commitments or setting targets) has been an instrumental part of our 30-year success. Our\ncorporate sustainability work is no different. And, as outlined below, we continue to execute against the plan we\nshared with our shareholders last year.\nAs disclosure controls, federal and state regulation, risk management, public marketing of sustainability\ninitiatives, and varying views on fiduciary responsibility continue to evolve and come under greater scrutiny, we\nbelieve that any external target-setting and broad-based commitment should be treated with as much care,\nconsideration, and responsibility as other forms of disclosure and/or financial guidance by public companies.\nWhile we maintain internal goals, we do not set broad, public targets or commitments with respect to many of\nour company performance / financial metrics. We do not believe that setting of climate related targets should be\ntreated any differently. In fact, after careful consideration of the issues in the context of our overall approach to\ncorporate sustainability, we have concluded that the setting of premature or unsubstantiated targets without\nclarity on a prevailing federal and state regulatory framework or first having a well-conceived (and achievable)\nplan poses substantial reputational, legal, and financial risk and is not in the best interest of our shareholders.\n98\nTexas Roadhouse has already taken significant steps to enhance GHG emissions disclosures\nand grow our sustainability efforts.\nConsistent with our strategy, and as we shared in our opposition response to essentially the same\nshareholder proposal last year, we set forth our strategic plan and approach for the next two years with respect\nto our efforts to measure and manage our GHG emissions. As shown in the table below, we shared certain\nactions with our shareholders regarding the steps we planned to take and which we have completed.\n2023 PROXY GHG PLANNED ACTIONS\n2023 Status\n• Publicly disclose Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (which were calculated in\naccordance with the World Resource Institute / World Business Council on\nSustainable Development and the Corporate Accounting and Report\nStandard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol)\n• Engage a third-party consultant to discuss ways to reduce Scope 1 and 2\nGHG emissions consistent with our operating model\n• Engage a third-party consultant to measure Scope 3 GHG emissions\n2024\n• Continue to publicly disclose Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for the 2023\nfiscal year In Progress\n• Publicly disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions\nThe majority of our shareholders supported the plan we set forth in last year’s proxy statement as\nevidenced by their voting support at our 2023 Annual Meeting. We also believe that many of the shareholders\nthat voted in favor of the shareholder proposal last year were focused on our previous lack of disclosure – which\nwe have addressed as more particularly described below – rather than the demand for broad public commitments\nor target setting. This belief was consistently reinforced throughout our shareholder engagement leading up to\nour 2023 Annual Meeting and throughout the remainder of the 2023 fiscal year as a majority of our shareholders\nwith whom we had discussions focused on their desire for additional quantitative disclosure for our corporate\nsustainability metrics rather than targets and commitments. Therefore, we still believe our plan, strategy, and\napproach is in the best interest of and in alignment with our shareholders interests and views, and we strongly\ndisagree with the proponents continued position and proposal.\n99\nWe, as a Company, affirm the standard that we strive to do what we say we will do and that we look for\nways to outperform and exceed expectations. Our historical financial and business results demonstrate the\nsuccess of this strategy. In this respect, we believe that 2023 was a landmark year in terms of our corporate\nsustainability efforts, and we have a focused risk management strategy for our corporate sustainability program\nfor the remainder of 2024 and beyond. In addition to our accomplishments described in the table above, we also\ntook the following steps in 2023:\n2023 ACCOMPLISHMENTS\nEngaged a consultant to perform a materiality assessment of our corporate\nsustainability program so that we can have a more directed approach to our\ncorporate sustainability risks.\nContinued routine calls with our largest distributor and key protein vendors to\ndiscuss (i) the steps they are taking from a sustainability standpoint to reduce\ntheir emissions, and (ii) ways to partner on sustainability initiatives.\nFormed an internal subcommittee under our corporate sustainability risk\ncommittee to evaluate and test equipment, products, and initiatives to lower our\nGHG emissions.\nBegan the process of piloting our first “Green” restaurant in the Southeast United\nStates – which is scheduled to open in the next twelve months.\nPurchased almost 200,000 sustainable uniform items, which helped keep nearly\n6 million 20oz plastic bottles out of landfills and oceans.\nUsed tree-free packaging for our Jaggers brand – which will be used to replace\nStyrofoam.\nConverted our gift cards from plastic to recycled paper.\nUsed recycled fryer oil in Jaggers, Bubba’s 33, and all new Texas Roadhouse\nopenings.\nInstalled tankless water heaters in nearly 90% of Texas Roadhouse locations.\nTexas Roadhouse is investing in strategic growth through its sustainability efforts, including\ntaking additional actions in 2024 and beyond.\nWe strongly reject the proponent’s assertion that we are “failing to proactively manage value chain\nemissions.” Our actions described above clearly demonstrate our level of commitment to not only sustain but\nstrategically grow our business through our corporate sustainability efforts. We know that our work does not end\nthere, and we intend to take the following actions in 2024:\n• Continue to monitor and disclose our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and publish our Scope 3 GHG\nemissions by the end of the 2024 fiscal year;\n• Analyze the results of the materiality assessment of our corporate sustainability program so that we\ncan have a more directed approach to our corporate sustainability risks, which assessment will be\n100\na well-informed guide for allowing us to prioritize the risks identified as most impactful by our internal\nand external stakeholders and analyze any related gaps to better inform our work;\n• Provide new disclosure in our 2024 corporate sustainability report relating to our EEO-1 data and\nour DE&I program, including the key initiatives under our program and the pillars of our DE&I\nAdvisory Council;\n• Continue discussions with our shareholders as a part of our shareholder outreach program\ndescribed in this proxy statement to better understand their respective views on our corporate\nsustainability initiatives and related disclosures;\n• Continue to have routine discussions with our largest distributor and key protein vendors to discuss\n(i) the steps they are taking from a sustainability standpoint to reduce their emissions, and (ii) ways\nto partner on sustainability initiatives;\n• Continue to evaluate operational initiatives to manage our GHG emissions, and utilize the efforts of\nour internal standing task force to evaluate and test equipment, products, and initiatives in order to\nassess and evaluate their performance, effectiveness, and availability together with their overall\nimpact on our GHG emissions; and\n• Continue to evaluate the various legislation, regulations, and international accords pertaining to\nclimate change such as the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), California’s\nClimate Corporate Data Accountability Act and Climate Related Financial Risk Act, and similar\nregulations under consideration by the SEC, as well as the impact they may have on our business\nand reporting.\nWe are providing this level of detail so that all shareholders have the entire context, and understand the\nprogress we have made, and continue to make, when evaluating our response to the proponent’s proposal.\nUltimately, we want to ensure that the majority of our shareholders who have long supported our deliberate,\nstudied, and methodical approach – which continues to consistently deliver shareholder value – understand the\nsteps that we are taking to evaluate, prioritize, and mitigate our corporate sustainability risks over time.\nFor the above-refenced reasons, the Board recommends that the shareholders vote against the\nproponent’s proposal.\nRecommendation\nTHE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE “AGAINST” THE SHAREHOLDER\nPROPOSAL REGARDING THE ISSUANCE OF A CLIMATE REPORT AND SETTING REDUCTION\nTARGETS BY THE COMPANY.\n101\nSHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS\nUnder Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act, shareholders may present proposals to be\nincluded in the Company proxy statement for consideration at the next annual meeting of its shareholders by\nsubmitting their proposals to the Company in a timely manner.

The rules of the SEC set forth standards for what shareholder proposals the\nCompany is required to include in a proxy statement for an annual meeting.\nThe Company’s Bylaws, a copy of which is available on the Company’s website at\nwww.texasroadhouse.com, require shareholders who intend to propose business for consideration by\nshareholders at the 2025 annual meeting, other than shareholder proposals that are to be included in the proxy\nstatement, to deliver written notice to the principal executive offices of the Company on or before December 6,\n2024 (reflecting 120 calendar days prior to the one year anniversary of the date of the Company’s proxy\nstatement issued in connection with the prior year’s annual meeting). This notice must include a description of\nthe business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the name and address of the shareholder\nproposing such business and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the business is being brought, the\nclass, series and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by the shareholder and such\nother beneficial owner and any material interest of the shareholder and such other beneficial owner in such\nbusiness.

BUSINESS\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “our” and/or “us”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of\nDelaware in 2004. The principal executive office is located in Louisville, Kentucky.\nIntroduction\nThe Company is a growing restaurant company operating predominantly in the casual dining segment. Our late\nfounder, W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in\nClarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to three concepts with 741 restaurants in 49 states and ten foreign\ncountries. Our mission statement is “Legendary Food, Legendary Service®.” Our operating strategy is designed to\nposition each of our casual dining restaurants as the local hometown favorite for a broad segment of consumers seeking\nhigh quality, affordable meals served with friendly, attentive service. As of December 26, 2023, we owned and operated\n635 restaurants and franchised an additional 58 domestic restaurants and 48 international restaurants.\nRestaurant Concepts\nOf the 635 restaurants we owned and operated at the end of 2023, we operated 582 as Texas Roadhouse restaurants,\n45 as Bubba’s 33 restaurants and eight as Jaggers restaurants.\nTexas Roadhouse is a moderately priced, full-service, casual dining restaurant concept offering an assortment of\nspecially seasoned and aged steaks hand-cut daily on the premises and cooked to order over open grills. In addition to\nsteaks, we also offer our guests a selection of ribs, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and\nan assortment of hamburgers, salads and sandwiches. The majority of our entrées include two made-from-scratch side\nitems, and we offer all our dine-in guests free roasted in-shell peanuts and fresh baked yeast rolls.\nBubba’s 33 is a moderately priced, full-service, casual dining restaurant concept featuring scratch-made food for all\nwith a little rock ‘n’ roll, ice-cold beer and signature drinks. Our menu features burgers, pizza and wings as well as a\nwide variety of appetizers, sandwiches and dinner entrées. Our first Bubba’s 33 restaurant opened in May 2013 in\nFayetteville, North Carolina.\nJaggers is a fast-casual restaurant concept offering burgers, hand-breaded chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches\nserved with scratch-made sauces. In addition, we offer fresh salads that are made-to-order and served with homemade\ndressings. Jaggers offers drive-thru, carry-out and dine-in service options. We also offer delivery services at certain\nlocations. Our first Jaggers restaurant opened in December 2014 in Noblesville, Indiana.\nThroughout this report, we use the term “restaurants” to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33, unless\notherwise noted.\nSegment Information\nWe manage our restaurant and franchising operations by concept and as a result have identified Texas Roadhouse,\nBubba’s 33, Jaggers and retail initiatives (including our online store and royalty-based licensing arrangements) as\nseparate operating segments. In addition, we have identified Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33 as reportable segments.\nOperating Strategy\nThe operating strategy that underlies the growth of our restaurants is built on the following key components:\n• Offering high quality, freshly prepared food. We place a great deal of emphasis on providing our guests with\nhigh quality, freshly prepared food. As part of our process, we have developed proprietary recipes to provide\nconsistency in quality and taste throughout all restaurants. We expect a management level employee to inspect\nevery entrée before it leaves the kitchen to confirm it matches the guest’s order and meets our standards for\nquality, portion size, appearance and presentation. In addition, we employ a team of product coaches whose\nfunction is to provide continual, hands-on training and education to our kitchen staff for the purpose of\npromoting consistent adherence to recipes, food preparation procedures, food safety standards and overall food\nquality.\n5\n• Creating a fun and comfortable atmosphere with a focus on high quality service. We believe the service\nquality and atmosphere we establish in our restaurants is a key component for fostering repeat business. In our\nfull-service restaurants, we focus on keeping our table-to-server ratios low to allow our servers to truly focus\non their guests and serve their needs in a personal, individualized manner. Our Texas Roadhouse restaurants\nfeature a rustic southwestern lodge décor accentuated with hand-painted murals, neon signs, and southwestern\nprints, rugs and artifacts. Additionally, our restaurants continuously play upbeat country hits. Our Bubba’s 33\nrestaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing sporting events and music videos and are decorated\nwith sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair. Our fast-casual concept, Jaggers, offers both drive-thru\nand dining room service in a modern design featuring a contemporary exterior and a comfortable and inviting\ndining room.\n• Offering performance-based manager compensation. As part of our effort to maintain a people-first culture,\nwe offer a performance-based compensation program supported by competitive benefits and health programs\nto our individual restaurant managers and multi-restaurant operators, who are called “managing partners” and\n“market partners,” respectively. Each of these partners earns a base salary plus a performance bonus, which\nrepresents a percentage of each of their respective restaurant’s pre-tax income. By providing our partners with\na significant stake in the success of our restaurants, we believe that we are able to attract and retain talented,\nexperienced and highly motivated managing and market partners.\n• Offering attractive price points. When we evaluate menu pricing, we focus on remaining disciplined as we\nbalance short-term pressures with long-term growth while always keeping our guest top of mind. Prices are\nreviewed individually in each local market and are offered at moderate price points that we believe are as low\nas or lower than those offered by our competitors without sacrificing food quality. Within each menu\ncategory, we offer a choice of several price points with the goal of fulfilling each guest’s budget and value\nexpectations. Based on the results of our pricing evaluations, we will continue to take pricing actions we feel\nare needed.\n• Focusing on dinner. In nearly all of our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner\nonly during the weekdays with approximately one half of our restaurants offering lunch on Friday. This focus\non dinner allows our restaurant teams to prepare for and manage only one shift per day during the week and to\nprepare for the significant volumes of sales our restaurants generate.\nRestaurant Development and Unit Economics\nWe consistently evaluate opportunities to develop restaurants in new and existing markets. Our site selection\nprocess is critical to our growth strategy. In analyzing each prospective site, our real estate team and restaurant market\npartners devote significant time and resources to the evaluation of local market demographics, population density,\nhousehold income levels and site-specific characteristics such as visibility, accessibility, traffic generators, proximity of\nother retail activities and competitors, traffic counts and parking. We work actively with experienced real estate brokers\nin target markets to select high quality sites and to maintain and regularly update our database of potential sites.\nWe design our restaurant prototypes to provide a relaxed atmosphere for our guests, while also focusing on\nrestaurant-level returns over time. Our current prototypical Texas Roadhouse restaurant consists of a freestanding\nbuilding with approximately 7,600 to 8,400 square feet with seating for approximately 270 to 325 guests and parking for\napproximately 180 vehicles either on-site or in combination with some form of off-site cross parking arrangement. Our\ncurrent prototypes are adaptable to in-line and end-cap locations and/or spaces within an enclosed mall or a shopping\ncenter.\nOur current prototypical Bubba’s 33 restaurant consists of a freestanding building with approximately 7,600 square\nfeet with seating for approximately 270 to 330 guests. Some locations include patio seating for approximately 60 guests.\nParking is targeted for approximately 180 vehicles either on-site or in combination with some form of off-site cross\nparking arrangement.\nOur capital investment for new restaurants, which includes an estimate of pre-opening expense and a 10x initial\nbase rent factor for those sites that are leased, varies significantly depending on a number of factors. These factors\ninclude, but are not limited to: the concept, square footage, layout, scope of required site work, geographical location,\nsupply chain costs, type of construction labor (union or non-union), local permitting requirements, our ability to\nnegotiate with landowners and/or landlords, cost of liquor and other licenses and pre-opening expense.\n6\nFor 2023 and 2022, our average capital investment for Texas Roadhouse restaurants was $7.9 million and $6.9\nmillion, respectively. The increase in our 2023 average capital investment was primarily due to an increase in building\nand site work costs and an increase in liquor license costs. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to\nbe opened in 2024 to remain flat at approximately $7.9 million.\nFor 2023 and 2022, our average capital investment for Bubba’s 33 restaurants was $8.2 million and $7.8 million,\nrespectively. The increase in our 2023 average capital investment was primarily due to an increase in pre-opening costs\nat one particular site. We expect our average capital investment for restaurants to be opened in 2024 to be approximately\n$8.5 million.\n7\nExisting Restaurant Locations\nAs of December 26, 2023, we had 635 company restaurants and 106 franchise restaurants in 49 states and ten\nforeign countries as shown in the chart below.\nNum be r of Resta ur ants\nCompany Franchise Total\nAlabama .................................................... 10 — 10\nAlaska ...................................................... 2 — 2\nArizona ..................................................... 20 — 20\nArkansas .................................................... 9 — 9\nCalifornia .................................................... 8 11 19\nColorado .................................................... 17 1 18\nConnecticut .................................................. 5 — 5\nDelaware .................................................... 5 — 5\nFlorida ...................................................... 44 — 44\nGeorgia ..................................................... 16 3 19\nIdaho ....................................................... 6 — 6\nIllinois ...................................................... 19 — 19\nIndiana ...................................................... 28 8 36\nIowa ....................................................... 11 — 11\nKansas ...................................................... 7 1 8\nKentucky .................................................... 19 3 22\nLouisiana .................................................... 10 1 11\nMaine ...................................................... 3 — 3\nMaryland .................................................... 14 — 14\nMassachusetts ................................................ 10 1 11\nMichigan .................................................... 21 3 24\nMinnesota ................................................... 7 — 7\nMississippi ................................................... 3 — 3\nMissouri ..................................................... 18 — 18\nMontana ..................................................... 2 1 3\nNebraska .................................................... 4 — 4\nNevada...................................................... 4 — 4\nNew Hampshire ............................................... 3 — 3\nNew Jersey ................................................... 10 — 10\nNew Mexico ................................................. 9 — 9\nNew York ................................................... 22 — 22\nNorth Carolina ................................................ 21 1 22\nNorth Dakota ................................................. 2 1 3\nOhio ....................................................... 36 1 37\nOklahoma ................................................... 10 — 10\nOregon ...................................................... 2 — 2\nPennsylvania ................................................. 27 6 33\nRhode Island ................................................. 3 — 3\nSouth Carolina ................................................ 9 — 9\nSouth Dakota ................................................. 2 — 2\nTennessee ................................................... 18 1 19\nTexas ....................................................... 87 6 93\nUtah ........................................................ 10 1 11\nVermont ..................................................... 1 — 1\nVirginia ..................................................... 22 — 22\nWashington .................................................. 2 1 3\nWest Virginia ................................................. 4 3 7\nWisconsin ................................................... 11 4 15\nWyoming .................................................... 2 — 2\nTotal domestic restaurants ..................................... 635 58 693\nBahrain ..................................................... — 1 1\nChina ....................................................... — 1 1\nSouth Korea .................................................. — 8 8\nKuwait ...................................................... — 3 3\nMexico...................................................... — 3 3\nPhilippines ................................................... — 16 16\nQatar ....................................................... — 1 1\nSaudi Arabia ................................................. — 5 5\nTaiwan ...................................................... — 5 5\nUnited Arab Emirates ........................................... — 5 5\nTotal international restaurants .................................. — 48 48\nTotal system-wide restaurants ..................................... 635 106 741\n8\nFood\nMenu. Our restaurants offer a wide variety of menu items at attractive prices that are designed to appeal to a broad\nrange of consumer tastes. At Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we offer a broad assortment of specially seasoned and aged\nsteaks, all cooked over open grills and all but one hand-cut daily on the premises. We also offer our guests a selection of\nribs, seafood, chicken, pork chops, pulled pork and vegetable plates, and an assortment of burgers, salads and\nsandwiches. Entrée prices include roasted in-shell peanuts, fresh baked yeast rolls and most include the choice of two\nmade-from-scratch sides. Other menu items include specialty appetizers such as the “Cactus Blossom®” and\n“Rattlesnake Bites”. We also provide a “12 & Under” menu for children that includes a selection of smaller-sized\nentrées served with one side item and a beverage.\nAt Bubba’s 33 restaurants, we offer a broad assortment of burgers, pizza and wings as well as a wide variety of\nappetizers, sandwiches and dinner entrées. Our Bubba’s 33 restaurants also offer an extensive selection of draft beer and\nsignature cocktails. We provide a “12 & Under” menu for children that includes a selection of items, including a\nbeverage.\nAt Jaggers restaurants, we offer fresh, authentic, scratch-made food including double stacked burgers, hand-breaded\nchicken sandwiches and chicken tenders, made-to-order fresh salads and hand-spun milkshakes. We also provide a\n“12 & Under” menu for children that includes a selection of smaller-sized entrées, a side, a drink and a cookie.\nMost of our full-service restaurants feature a full bar that offers a selection of draft and bottled beer, major brands\nof liquor and wine as well as made in-house margaritas and signature cocktails. Managing partners are encouraged to\ntailor their beer selection to include regional and local brands. In 2023, alcoholic beverages at all company restaurants\naccounted for 10.3% of restaurant sales.\nWe always strive to maintain a consistent menu at our restaurants. We continually review our menu to consider\nenhancements to existing menu items or the introduction of new items. We change our menu only after guest feedback\nand an extensive study of the operational and economic implications. To maintain our high levels of food quality and\nservice, we generally remove one menu item for every new menu item introduced to facilitate our ability to execute high\nquality meals on a focused range of menu items.\nWe work with a third-party vendor to manage an online tool to provide nutritional information as well as help\ncustomers identify known allergens in each of our menu items. This information is available for all concepts.\nFood Quality and Safety. We are committed to serving a varied menu of high quality, great tasting food items with\nan emphasis on freshness. We have developed proprietary recipes to promote consistency in quality and taste\nthroughout all restaurants and provide a unique flavor experience to our guests. At each domestic Texas Roadhouse\nrestaurant, a trained meat cutter hand cuts our steaks and other restaurant employees prepare our side items and yeast\nrolls from scratch in the restaurants daily. At both Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33 restaurants, we assign individual\nkitchen employees to the preparation of designated food items in order to focus on quality, consistency, speed and food\nsafety. Additionally, we expect a management level employee to inspect every entrée before it leaves the kitchen to\nconfirm it matches the guest’s order and meets our standards for quality, portion size, appearance and presentation.\nWe employ a team of product coaches whose function is to provide continual, hands-on training and education to\nthe kitchen staff in all of our restaurants for the purpose of reinforcing food quality, recipe consistency, food preparation\nprocedures, food safety and sanitation standards, food appearance, freshness and portion size. The product coach team\nsupports all of our full-service domestic restaurants.\nFood safety and sanitation is of utmost importance to us. We currently utilize several additional programs to help\nfacilitate adherence to proper food preparation procedures and food safety standards including our daily taste and\ntemperature procedures. We have a food team whose function, in conjunction with our product coaches, is to develop,\nenforce and maintain programs designed to promote compliance with food safety guidelines. As a requirement of our\nquality assurance process, primary food items are purchased from qualified vendors who are regularly audited by\nreputable, outside inspection services confirming that the vendor is compliant with United States Food and Drug\nAdministration and United States Department of Agriculture guidelines, the results of which are reviewed by our food\nsafety team.\nWe perform regular food safety and sanitation audits on our restaurants and these results are reviewed by various\nmembers of operations and management. To maximize adherence to food safety protocols, we have incorporated\n9\nHazard Analysis Critical Control Points principles and critical procedures (such as hand washing) in each recipe. All\nrestaurant managers are required to complete the American National Standards Institute Certified Food Manager\ntraining. In addition, product coaches and certain food team members are required to obtain their Certified Professional-\nFood Safety designation from the National Environmental Health Association.\nProcurement. Our procurement philosophy is designed to supply fresh, quality products to the restaurants at\ncompetitive prices while maximizing operating efficiencies. We negotiate directly with suppliers for substantially all\nfood and beverage products to maximize quality and freshness and obtain competitive prices.\nFood and supplies are ordered by and shipped directly to our domestic restaurants. Most food products used in the\noperation of our restaurants are distributed to individual restaurants through an independent national distribution\ncompany. We strive to qualify more than one supplier for all key food items and believe that beef of comparable quality\nas well as all other essential food and beverage products are available, upon short notice, from alternative qualified\nsuppliers.\nService\nService Quality. We believe that guest satisfaction and our ability to continually evaluate and improve the guest\nexperience at each of our restaurants is important to our success. We employ a team of service coaches whose function\nis to provide consistent, hands-on training and education to our managers and service staff in our domestic restaurants.\nThis training and education reinforces service quality, teamwork, responsible alcohol service, staff attentiveness and\nguest interactions in the dining room as well as the implementation of new technologies and process changes.\nGuest Satisfaction. Through the use of guest surveys, our various websites including “texasroadhouse.com,”\n“bubbas33.com” or “eatjaggers.com,” a toll-free guest response telephone line, emails, letters, social media and personal\ninteraction in the restaurant, we receive valuable feedback from guests. We have implemented several programs to\nevaluate guest satisfaction, with particular attention given to food, beverage and service quality, cleanliness, staff attitude\nand teamwork, and manager visibility and interaction. We continue to evaluate and implement new processes and\ntechnologies relating to guest satisfaction, including reducing guest wait times, improving host interaction with the guest\nand improving the to-go experience for our guests.\nAtmosphere. The atmosphere of our restaurants is intended to appeal to broad segments of the population.\nSubstantially all Texas Roadhouse restaurants are of our prototype design, reflecting a rustic southwestern lodge\natmosphere. The interiors feature wood walls and stained concrete floors and are decorated with hand-painted murals,\nneon signs, southwestern prints, rugs and artifacts. The restaurants continuously play upbeat country hits. Guests may\nalso view a display-baking area, where our fresh baked yeast rolls are prepared, and a meat cooler displaying fresh cut\nsteaks. Once seated at a table, guests can enjoy free fresh baked yeast rolls along with roasted in-shell peanuts. Our\nBubba’s 33 restaurants feature walls lined with televisions playing a variety of sports events and music videos and are\ndecorated with sports jerseys, neon signs and other local flair. Our fast-casual concept, Jaggers, offers both drive-thru\nand dining room service in a modern design featuring a contemporary exterior and a comfortable and inviting dining\nroom.\nPeople\nManagement Personnel. Each of our restaurants is generally staffed with one managing partner and a combination\nof operations, kitchen and service managers as well as assistant managers. Managing partners are single restaurant\noperators who have primary responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the entire restaurant. Operations managers\nsupport the managing partner in overall operations including oversight over the kitchen and service departments.\nKitchen managers have primary responsibility for managing sections of the kitchen staff and certain kitchen operations\nincluding food production, preparation, execution and quality standards. Service managers have primary responsibility\nfor managing sections of the front of house staff and certain dining room, bar and to-go operations including service\nquality and the guest experience. Assistant managers support our managing partners, operations managers and kitchen\nand service managers. All managers are responsible for maintaining our standards of quality and performance.\nWe use market partners to oversee the operation of our restaurants. Each market partner oversees a group of\nvarying sizes of managing partners and their respective management teams. Market partners are also responsible for the\nhiring and development of each restaurant’s management team and assisting in the site selection process. Through\nregular visits to the restaurants, the market partners facilitate adherence to all aspects of our concepts, strategies and\nstandards of quality. To further facilitate adherence to our standards of quality and to maximize uniform execution\n10\nthroughout the system, we employ product coaches and service coaches who regularly visit the restaurants to assist in\ntraining of both new and existing employees and to grade food and service quality. The attentive service and high\nquality food, which results from each restaurant having a managing partner, at least two to four managers and the\nhands-on assistance of a product coach and a service coach, are critical to our success.\nManaging partners and market partners are required, as a condition of employment, to sign a multi-year\nemployment agreement. The annual compensation of our managing partners and market partners includes a base salary\nplus a percentage of pre-tax income of the restaurant(s) they operate or supervise. Managing partners and market\npartners are eligible to participate in our equity incentive plan and are required to make refundable deposits at the time of\nhire, that reinforces an ownership mentality. Generally, the deposits are refunded after five years of continuous service.\nTraining and Development. All restaurant employees are required to complete varying degrees of training before\nand during employment. Our comprehensive training program emphasizes our operating strategy, procedures and\nstandards, including responsible alcohol service, and is typically conducted individually at our restaurants or in groups\nthroughout the country.\nOur managing and market partners are generally required to have significant experience in the full-service\nrestaurant industry and are generally hired at a minimum of nine months before their placement in a new or existing\nrestaurant to allow time to fully train in all aspects of restaurant operations. All managing partners, kitchen and service\nmanagers and other management employees are required to complete an extensive training program of up to 20 weeks,\nwhich includes training for every position in the restaurant. Trainees are validated at pre-determined points during their\ntraining by a market partner, managing partner, product coach and service coach.\nWe have designated a number of our restaurants to be certified as training centers by our training department.\nThese stores are utilized to train our new and existing managers to ensure compliance with all operating procedures and\nguidelines. Additionally, most restaurants are staffed with training coordinators responsible for ongoing daily training\nneeds.\nFor new restaurant openings, a full team of designated trainers, each specializing in a specific restaurant position, is\ndeployed to the restaurant at least ten days before opening. Formal employee training begins seven days before opening\nand follows a uniform, comprehensive training course as directed by a service coach.\nMarketing\nOur marketing strategy aims to promote our brands while retaining a localized focus. We strive to increase\ncomparable restaurant sales by increasing the frequency of visits by our current guests and attracting new guests to our\nrestaurants and also by communicating and promoting our concepts’ food quality, the guest experience and value. We\naccomplish these objectives through three major initiatives.\nLocal Restaurant Marketing. Given our strategy to be a neighborhood destination, local restaurant marketing is\nintegral in developing brand awareness in each market. Managing partners are encouraged to participate in creative\ncommunity-based marketing. We also engage in a variety of promotional activities, such as contributing time, money\nand complimentary meals to charitable, civic and cultural programs. We employ marketing coordinators at the\nrestaurant and market level to develop and execute the majority of the local marketing strategies.\nIn-restaurant Marketing. A significant portion of our marketing fund is spent communicating with our guests\ninside our restaurants through point of purchase materials. We believe special promotions such as Valentine’s Day,\nMother’s Day and Veterans Day drive notable repeat business. Our eight-week holiday gift card campaign is one of our\nmost impactful promotions.\nAdvertising. Our restaurants do not rely on national television or print advertising to promote our brands. Earned\nlocal media is a critical part of our strategy that features our products and people. Our restaurants use a\npermission-based email loyalty program, as well as social media and digital marketing, to promote the brand and engage\nwith our guests. Our approach to media aligns with our focus on local store marketing and community involvement.\nAdditionally, we continue to look for ways through various strategic initiatives to drive awareness and guest engagement\nwith our brands. This includes the introduction of branded food and retail products that are available for purchase online\nor in select retailers. These products include non-royalty based food and accessories as well as licensing arrangements\nfor certain non-alcoholic beverages.\n11\nRestaurant Franchise Arrangements\nFranchise Restaurants. As of December 26, 2023, we had 21 franchisees that operated 106 Texas Roadhouse and\nJaggers restaurants in 20 states and ten foreign countries. Domestically, franchise rights for our Texas Roadhouse\nrestaurants are granted for specific restaurants only, as we have not granted any rights to develop a territory. We are\ncurrently not accepting new domestic Texas Roadhouse franchisees. Approximately 85% of our franchise restaurants\nare operated by ten franchisees and no franchisee operates more than 16 restaurants.\nOur standard Texas Roadhouse domestic franchise agreement has a term of ten years with two renewal options for\nan additional five years each if certain conditions are satisfied. Our current form of domestic franchise agreement\ngenerally requires the franchisee to pay a franchise fee for each restaurant opened and royalties based on a percentage of\ngross sales. In addition, domestic Texas Roadhouse franchisees are required to pay a percentage of gross sales to a\nnational marketing fund for system-wide promotions and related efforts.\nWe have entered into area development and franchise agreements for the development and operation of Texas\nRoadhouse restaurants in several foreign countries and one U.S. territory. For the existing international agreements, the\nfranchisee is generally required to pay us a development fee for our grant of development rights in the named countries,\na franchise fee for each restaurant to be opened and royalties on the sales of each restaurant.\nWe have also entered into area development agreements for Jaggers, our fast-casual concept. Currently, we have\nagreements in place that allow for the development and operation of restaurants in specific territories in Texas,\nOklahoma, and North Carolina. As part of these agreements, the franchisees are required to pay us a development fee\nfor our grant of development rights in the named territories, a franchise fee for each restaurant to be opened and royalties\nbased on a percentage of gross sales. We opened our first two Jaggers franchise restaurants in 2023.\nOur standard Texas Roadhouse and Jaggers domestic franchise agreements give us the right, but not the obligation,\nto compel a franchisee to transfer its interests to us based on pre-determined formulas included in our franchise\nagreements.\nAny of our area development or franchise agreements, whether domestic or international, may be terminated if the\nfranchisee defaults in the performance of any of its obligations under the development or franchise agreement, including\nits obligations to develop the territory or operate its restaurants in accordance with our standards and specifications. A\nfranchise agreement may also be terminated if a franchisee becomes insolvent, fails to make its required payments,\ncreates a threat to the public health or safety, ceases to operate the restaurant, or misuses our trademarks.\nFranchise Compliance Assurance. We have various systems in place to promote compliance with our systems and\nstandards, both during the development and operation of franchise restaurants. We actively work with our franchisees to\nsupport successful franchise operations as well as compliance with our standards and procedures. During the restaurant\ndevelopment phase, we consent to the selection of restaurant sites and make available copies of our prototype building\nplans to franchisees. In addition, we ensure that the building design is in compliance with our standards. We provide\ntraining to the managing partner and up to three other managers of a franchisee’s first restaurant. We also provide\ntrainers to assist in the opening of every domestic franchise restaurant and we provide trainers to assist our international\nfranchisees in the opening of their restaurants until such time as they develop an approved restaurant opening training\nprogram. Finally, on an ongoing basis, we conduct reviews on all franchise restaurants to determine their level of\neffectiveness in executing our concept at a variety of operational levels. Our franchisees are required to follow the same\nstandards and procedures regarding equipment and food purchases, preparation and safety procedures as we maintain in\nour company restaurants. Reviews are conducted by seasoned operations teams and focus on key areas including health,\nsafety and execution proficiency.\nManagement Services. We provide management services to certain domestic franchise restaurants, some in which\nwe have an ownership interest and others in which we have no ownership interest. Such management services may\ninclude accounting, operational supervision, human resources, training, and food, beverage and equipment consulting for\nwhich we receive monthly fees. We also make available to these restaurants certain legal services, restaurant employees\nand employee benefits on a pass-through cost basis.\nInformation Technology\nAll of our company restaurants utilize computerized management information systems, which are designed to\nimprove operating efficiencies, provide restaurant and Support Center management with timely access to financial and\n12\noperating data and reduce administrative time and expense. With our current information systems, we have the ability to\nquery, report and analyze this intelligent data on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and year-to-date basis and beyond,\non a company-wide, concept, regional, market or individual restaurant basis. Together, this enables us to closely\nmonitor sales and operating expenses at each of our restaurants throughout all concepts. We have a number of systems\nand reports that provide comparative information that enables both restaurant and Support Center management to\nsupervise the financial and operational performance of our restaurants and to recognize and understand trends in the\nbusiness. Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurants is provided and coordinated from the\nrestaurant Support Center in Louisville, Kentucky.\nIn the course of business, we gather and maintain sensitive information from our guests, employees, partners and\nbusiness operations. To protect this information, we have created and implemented a detailed set of procedures that are\ninformed by recognized national and international standards. We have implemented extensive detective and\npreventative controls designed to ensure the appropriate level of protection for the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of data stored on or transferred through our information technology resources. Additionally, we guard\nagainst business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes, among other things, storing critical\nbusiness information off-site, maintaining a redundant data center, testing the disaster recovery plan and providing\non-site power backup.\nIn addition to cash, we accept credit cards, debit cards and gift cards as payment at our restaurants. We have\nsystems and processes in place that focus on the protection of our guests’ credit and debit card information and other\nprivate information that we are required to protect, such as our employees’ personal information. Our systems have been\ncarefully designed and configured to safeguard against data loss or compromise. We submit our systems to regular audit\nand review, ensuring compliance with the requirements of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards and to assess\nvulnerability in our systems. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with\nbreaches of security related to confidential guest and/or employee information.\nWe have made several digital enhancements to improve the guest experience and better support increased volumes\nat our restaurants. These enhancements include a new, fully customized digital experience that allows our guests to get\non the waitlist or place an order for pickup or curbside service. The new digital experience also has added gift card and\npayment functionality. We have also implemented texting systems which allows our dine-in guests to wait outside or in\ntheir cars and has improved the to-go experience. In addition, we have implemented systems that enable touchless\nmenus and contactless payments, providing a smoother guest checkout experience and enhanced turnaround times.\nFinally, we have started implementing digital display systems in our kitchens that increase kitchen efficiency, allow us to\nhandle increased volumes and enhance the employee experience.\nWe believe that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support\nour current needs and future growth. Information systems projects are prioritized based on strategic, financial,\nregulatory and other business advantage criteria.\nCompetition\nCompetition in the restaurant industry is intense. We compete with well-established food service companies on the\nbasis of taste, quality and price of the food offered, service, atmosphere, location, take-out and delivery options as well\nas the overall dining experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individual\nrestaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to\nwell-capitalized national restaurant chains. We also face competition from meal kit delivery services as well as the\nsupermarket industry. In addition, improving product offerings of fast casual and quick-service restaurants and better\nexecution of to-go sales, together with negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive\nalternatives. Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of the above channels, other\nrestaurants and retail establishments compete for the same casual dining guests, quality site locations and\nrestaurant-level employees as we do. We expect intense competition to continue across all aspects of the restaurant\nindustry.\nTrademarks\nOur registered trademarks and service marks include, among others, our trade names and logos and proprietary\nrights related to certain core menu offerings. We have registered all of our significant marks for our restaurants with the\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office. We have registered or have registrations pending for our most significant\n13\ntrademarks and service marks in multiple foreign jurisdictions. To better protect our brands, we have also registered\nvarious Internet domain names. We believe that our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary rights have\nsignificant value and are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our restaurant concepts.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. For a discussion of\nthe risks and potential impact on our business of a failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations, see\nItem 1A, Risk Factors.\nEach of our restaurants is subject to permitting and licensing requirements and regulations by a number of\ngovernment authorities, which may include, among others, alcoholic beverage control, health and safety, sanitation,\nlabor, zoning and public safety agencies in the state and/or municipality in which each restaurant is located. The\ndevelopment and operation of restaurants depends on selecting and acquiring suitable sites that satisfy our financial\ntargets, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations.\nIn addition to domestic regulations, our international business exposes us to additional regulations, including\nantitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott legislation, import/export and customs regulations and other international\ntrade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are also subject to laws and\nregulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional\ncontent and menu labeling.\nIn order to serve alcoholic beverages in our restaurants, we must comply with alcoholic beverage control\nregulations which require each of our restaurants to apply to a state authority, and, in certain locations, county or\nmunicipal authorities, for a license or permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises. These licenses or permits must\nbe renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. We are also subject in certain states to\n“dram shop” statutes, which generally provide a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages\nfrom an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Consistent with industry standards, we\nfocus on responsible alcohol service training and carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive\ngeneral liability insurance as well as excess umbrella coverage.\nOur restaurant operations are also subject to federal and state labor laws governing such matters as minimum and\ntipped wage requirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation, work eligibility\nrequirements, working conditions, safety standards and hiring and employment practices. A significant number of our\nhourly restaurant personnel receive tips as part of their compensation and are paid at or above a minimum wage rate after\ngiving effect to applicable tips. We rely on our employees to accurately disclose the full amount of their tip income. We\nbase our FICA tax reporting on the disclosures provided to us by our tipped employees.\nOur facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990\n(“ADA”) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent\nservice to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment. In addition, when constructing\nor undertaking remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit protection\nand fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and\nstandards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including\ncredit and debit card numbers) and health information.\nSeasonality\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher\nduring the winter months of each year. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact\nsales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. As a result, our quarterly operating results and comparable\nrestaurant sales may fluctuate due to seasonality. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative\nof results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future\nperiod may fluctuate.\n14\nHuman Capital Management\nAt Texas Roadhouse, we take pride in being a people-first company. As of December 26, 2023, we employed\napproximately 91,000 people. This included 845 executive and administrative personnel and 3,507 restaurant\nmanagement personnel, while the remainder were full and part-time hourly restaurant personnel. None of our employees\nare covered by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our employee relations to be good.\nOur business relies on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. To attract and retain talent, we strive to\nmaintain our people-first culture through shared core values, a performance-based compensation program supported by\ncompetitive benefits and health programs with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers.\nAdditionally, we believe that diversity and inclusion are vital parts of our culture and what truly makes us\nlegendary. We value and welcome employees of all walks of life to share their talents, gifts and strengths while working\nin our restaurants and the Support Center, as we strive to reflect the communities we are proud to serve. As a result, we\nare committed to attracting, retaining, engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests and\nis committed to upholding our shared values. The table below shows the gender and racial and ethnic diversity of our\nemployees as of December 26, 2023:\nDecemb er 26, 2023\nWomen People of Color (1)\nSupport Center ........................................................ 54 % 11 %\nRestaurant Managers ................................................... 39 % 24 %\nHourly Restaurant Employees ........................................... 57 % 40 %\n(1) Denotes employees at company restaurants and our Support Center that identify as American Indian/Alaskan\nNative, Asian, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or two or more races.\nMaintaining our Culture and Core Values. In our restaurants and at our Support Center, we are committed to our\nshared “Core Values of Passion, Partnership, Integrity, and Fun…all with Purpose”. These Core Values form the\nfoundation of who we are as a company and how we interact with respect, appreciation, and fairness towards one another\nevery day.\nPerformance-based Compensation and Benefits. We support our employees by offering competitive wages and\nbenefits for eligible employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by employee level) include, among\nother items, bonuses, stock awards, retirement savings plans with employer matching contributions, healthcare and\ninsurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, tuition reimbursement, paid time off, paid parental\nleave and various employee assistance programs.\nWe also offer a performance-based compensation program to our managing partners and market partners. Each of\nthese positions earn a base salary plus a performance bonus, which represents a percentage of each of their respective\nrestaurant’s pre-tax income. By providing our partners with a significant stake in the success of our restaurants, we\nbelieve that we are able to attract and retain talented, experienced and highly motivated managing and market partners.\nPersonal Development. We motivate and develop our employees by providing them with opportunities for\nincreased responsibilities and advancement. We provide numerous training opportunities for our employees, with a\nfocus on continuous learning and development. With thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants, we\nprovide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entry-level jobs into\nmanagement roles. In addition, our geographic footprint often allows us to offer our restaurant team members relocation\noptions at similar roles due to personal circumstances.\nHealth and Safety. The health and safety of our employees is a top priority and we are committed to providing a\nsafe workplace, ensuring the safety and well-being of all team members while also ensuring that we are in compliance\nwith all laws and regulations as well as internal policies. This commitment includes the deployment of specific\nprotocols and standards to our restaurants that focus on maintaining the health and safety of our employees.\nAndy’s Outreach. Founded in 2005, Andy’s Outreach is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization whose mission is to\nprovide financial support to employees of Texas Roadhouse and their families in times of severe hardship or crisis and in\n15\ncases of tragic or catastrophic need. Andy’s Outreach is mainly funded by the support of Texas Roadhouse employees\nthrough payroll contributions, a domestic franchise store that is owned by Andy’s Outreach and other fundraising efforts.\nSince its inception, Andy’s Outreach has assisted over 20,000 employees and distributed over $26 million.\nCorporate Sustainability\nOur corporate sustainability mission is to leave every community better than we found it by focusing on four\npillars – food, community, employees and conservation. As we test and roll out new programs, we continue to build\nchampions who are invested in furthering our sustainability efforts. Ongoing initiatives such as our meat cutter program,\nsupport of non-profits, employee development and focus on conservation, create steady progress for our overall\ncorporate sustainability program and are integrated into our daily operations. Additional information about our\ncorporate sustainability mission is available through our website at www.texasroadhouse.com, under the corporate\nsustainability section.\nWebsite Access to Reports\nWe make our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934, available, free of charge on or through our website, www.texasroadhouse.com, as soon as reasonably practical\nafter we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

If any of the risks and uncertainties described\nin the cautionary factors described below actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity\nand the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, we operate in a very\ncompetitive and rapidly changing environment. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict\nthe impact of all these factors on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nRisks Related to our Growth and Operating Strategy\nOur growth strategy, which primarily depends on our ability to open new restaurants that are profitable, is subject to\nmany factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to open new restaurants that are profitable in accordance with our\nexpansion plans. We have experienced delays in opening some of our restaurants in the past and may experience delays\nin the future. These delays impact the timing of new restaurant openings and the related pre-opening expenses. Delays\nor failures in opening new restaurants could adversely affect our growth strategy. One of our biggest challenges in\nexecuting our growth strategy may be locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new restaurant sites that\nsatisfy our financial targets. Competition for suitable restaurant sites in our target markets may be intense.\nOnce opened, we anticipate that our new restaurants will generally take several months to reach planned operating\nlevels due to start-up inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants. We cannot assure you that any restaurant\nwe open will be profitable or obtain operating results similar to those of our existing restaurants. Some of our new\nrestaurants will be located in areas where we have little or no meaningful experience. Those new markets may have\nsmaller trade areas and different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our\ntraditional, existing markets, which may cause our new store locations to be less successful than restaurants in our\nexisting market areas. Restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volume than\nrestaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant-level operating expense ratios than in existing\nmarkets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average unit volume, if at all, thereby\naffecting our overall profitability. Our localized marketing strategy may not result in brand awareness and guest\nengagement. Additionally, the opening of a new restaurant could negatively impact sales at one or more of our existing\nnearby restaurants, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur ability to open new restaurants that are profitable will also depend on numerous other factors, many of which\nare beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n• our ability to hire, train and retain qualified operating personnel, especially market partners, managing\npartners, and/or other restaurant management personnel who can execute our business strategy and maintain\nour culture and brand standards;\n• our ability to negotiate suitable purchase or lease terms to execute our business strategy;\n• the availability and cost of construction materials, equipment and labor;\n17\n• our ability to control construction and development costs of new restaurants (including increased site, supply\nchain and distribution costs);\n• our ability to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner, or at all;\n• road construction and other factors limiting access to the restaurant;\n• delays by our landlord or other developers in constructing other parts of a development adjacent to our\npremises in a timely manner;\n• redevelopment of other parts of a development adjacent to our premises that affect the parking available for\nour restaurant;\n• our ability to secure liquor licenses;\n• competitive and economic conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are different\nfrom and more difficult to predict or satisfy than in our existing markets;\n• changes in federal, state and/or local tax laws;\n• the cost and availability of capital to fund construction costs and pre-opening expenses; and\n• the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities.\nYou should not rely on past changes in our average unit volume or our comparable restaurant sales as an indication\nof our future results of operations because they may fluctuate significantly.\nA number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our average unit volume and comparable\nrestaurant sales, including, among other factors:\n• consumer awareness and understanding of our concepts;\n• our ability to execute our business strategy effectively;\n• our ability to maintain higher levels of to-go sales at our restaurants;\n• competition, from our competitors in the restaurant industry, our own restaurants, and/or other food service\nproviders (such as delivery services and grocery stores);\n• the impact of permanent changes in weather patterns that can cause inclement weather, natural disasters and\nother calamities which impact guest traffic or product availability at our restaurants;\n• consumer trends and seasonality;\n• our ability to increase menu prices without adversely impacting guest traffic counts or per person average\ncheck growth;\n• introduction of new menu items;\n• loss of parking and/or access rights due to government action (such as eminent domain actions) or through\nprivate transactions;\n• closures and/or dining rooms operating at limited capacity due to government mandated restaurant closures\nand/or limited availability of staff to meet our business standards;\n• negative publicity regarding food safety, health concerns, quality of service, and other food or beverage related\nmatters, including the integrity of our or our suppliers’ food processing;\n18\n• general economic conditions, including an economic recession, which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor\ncosts and prices we pay for the food and beverage products and other supplies we use;\n• legislation that impacts our suppliers’ ability to maintain compliance with laws and regulations and impacts\nour ability to source product; and\n• effects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks (including cyber and/or ransomware attacks).\nOur average unit volume and comparable restaurant sales may not increase at rates achieved in the past, which may\naffect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting our profitability. Our business is also subject to\nseasonal fluctuations. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the winter months of each\nyear. Holidays, changes in weather, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some\noperating regions. Accordingly, results for one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any\nother quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease. In the\nfuture, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the price of\nour common stock could decrease.\nThe development and/or acquisition of new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our growth.\nThe development of new restaurant concepts, including Bubba’s 33 and Jaggers, created internally or acquired as a\npart of our other strategic initiatives may not be as successful as our experience in the development of the Texas\nRoadhouse concept. These concepts may have lower brand awareness and less operating experience than most Texas\nRoadhouse restaurants. In addition, they may have a higher initial investment cost and/or a lower per person average\ncheck amount. As a result, the development and/or acquisition of new restaurant concepts may not contribute to our\naverage unit volume growth and/or profitability in an incremental way. We can provide no assurance that new units will\nbe accepted in the markets targeted for expansion and/or that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our targeted\nreturns when opening new locations. In the future, we may determine not to move forward with any further expansion\nand/or acquisition of new restaurant concepts. These decisions could limit or delay our overall long-term growth.\nAdditionally, expansion and/or acquisition of new restaurant concepts might divert our management’s attention from\nother business concerns or initiatives and could have an adverse impact on our core Texas Roadhouse business.\nOur expansion into international markets presents increased economic, political, regulatory and other risks.\nAs of December 26, 2023, our operations include 48 Texas Roadhouse franchise restaurants in ten countries outside\nthe United States, and we expect to have further international expansion in the future with one or more of our concepts.\nThe entrance into international markets may not be as successful as our experience in the development of the Texas\nRoadhouse concept domestically or any success we have had with the Texas Roadhouse concept in other international\nmarkets. In addition, operating in international markets may require significant resources and management attention and\nwill subject us to economic, political and regulatory risks that are different from and incremental to those in the United\nStates. In addition to the risks that we face in the United States, our international operations involve risks that could\nadversely affect our business, including:\n• the need to adapt our concepts for specific cultural and language differences;\n• new and different sources of competition;\n• the ability to identify appropriate business partners;\n• difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n• difficulties in adapting and sourcing product specifications for international restaurant locations;\n• fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could impact royalties, revenue and expenses of our\ninternational operations and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk;\n• difficulties in complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n• unexpected changes in regulatory requirements or tariffs on goods needed to construct and/or operate our\nrestaurants;\n19\n• political or social unrest, economic instability and destabilization of a region;\n• effects of actual or threatened terrorist attacks;\n• health concerns from global pandemics;\n• compliance with U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions;\n• differences in the registration and/or enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n• adverse tax consequences;\n• profit repatriation and other restrictions on the transfer of funds; and\n• different and more stringent user protection, data protection, privacy and other laws.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our future international operations and our overall\nbusiness and results of our operations.\nWe are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our\ninternational franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs,\ntariffs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to\ncomply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could\nadversely impact our business and financial performance.\nAcquisition of existing restaurants from our domestic franchisees and other strategic initiatives may have\nunanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nWe plan to continue to opportunistically acquire existing restaurants from our domestic franchisees over time.\nAdditionally, from time to time, we evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives\n(including retail initiatives utilizing our intellectual property or other brand extensions) to acquire or develop additional\nbusiness channels or concepts, and/or change the business strategy regarding an existing concept. To successfully\nexecute any acquisition or development strategy, we will need to identify suitable acquisition or development candidates,\nnegotiate acceptable acquisition or development terms and possibly obtain appropriate financing.\nAny acquisition or future development that we pursue, including the on-going development of new concepts or\nretail initiatives utilizing our intellectual property, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n• material adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the\nacquisition or development as the restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n• risks associated with entering into new domestic markets or conducting operations where we have no or\nlimited prior experience;\n• risks associated with successfully integrating new employees, processes and systems while also maintaining\nour culture and brand standards;\n• risks inherent in accurately assessing the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and\nother liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates, and our ability to achieve projected\neconomic and operating synergies, without impacting our underlying business; and\n• the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture acquisitions of existing restaurants from our franchisees or other strategic partners, which may be\naccomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of shares of common stock or a combination of both,\ncould have a dilutive impact on holders of our common stock and result in the incurrence of debt and contingent\nliabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other tangible and intangible assets, any of which could harm\nour business and financial condition. Additionally, following a franchise acquisition, we may be required to incur\nsubstantial capital improvement costs to meet company standards, which could impact our return on such acquisition.\n20\nAdditionally, we may evaluate other means to leverage our competitive strengths, including the expansion of our\nproducts across other strategic initiatives or business opportunities (including retail initiatives utilizing our intellectual\nproperty). The expansion of our products may damage our reputation if products bearing our brands are not of the same\nquality or value that guests associate with our concepts. In addition, we may experience dilution of the goodwill\nassociated with our concepts as they become more common and increasingly accessible.\nApproximately 21% of our company restaurants are located in Texas and Florida and, as a result, we are sensitive to\neconomic and other trends and developments in those states.\nAs of December 26, 2023, we operated a total of 87 company restaurants in Texas and 44 company restaurants in\nFlorida. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states, including\nany state mandated changes in minimum and tipped wage rates and economic pressures that may result in lower sales\nand profits at our restaurants. In addition, given our geographic concentration in these states, negative publicity\nregarding any of our restaurants in either Texas or Florida could have a material adverse effect on our business and\noperations, as could other occurrences in either Texas or Florida such as health epidemics or pandemics, local strikes,\nenergy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires or other natural\ndisasters.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nBoth our domestic and international franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in\naccordance with our applicable restaurant operating standards. We also provide training and support to franchisees.\nHowever, most franchisees are independent third parties that we do not control, and these franchisees own, operate and\noversee the daily operations of their restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant\nrests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our\nstandards, our image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating\nresults.\nDecreased cash flow from operations, or an inability to access credit, could negatively affect our business initiatives\nor may result in our inability to execute our revenue, expense, and capital allocation strategies.\nOur ability to fund our operating plans and to implement our capital allocation strategies depends on sufficient cash\nflow from operations and/or other financing, including the use of funding under our credit facility. We also may seek\naccess to the debt and/or equity capital markets. There can be no assurance, however, that these sources of financing\nwill be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. Our capital allocation strategies include, but are not limited to, new\nrestaurant development, payment of dividends, refurbishment or relocation of existing restaurants, repurchases of our\ncommon stock and franchise acquisitions. If we experience decreased cash flow from operations, our ability to fund our\noperations and planned initiatives, and to take advantage of growth opportunities, may be delayed or negatively affected.\nIn addition, these disruptions or a negative effect on our revenue could affect our ability to borrow or comply with our\ncovenants under our credit facility. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth could be impeded.\nOur existing credit facility limits our ability to incur additional debt.\nThe lenders’ obligation to extend credit under our credit facility depends on our maintaining certain financial\ncovenants. If we are unable to maintain these covenants, we would be unable to obtain additional financing under this\ncredit facility. The credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness outside the credit\nfacility, except for the incurrence of secured indebtedness that in the aggregate is equal to or greater than $125.0 million\nand 20% of our consolidated tangible net worth or circumstances where the incurrence of secured or unsecured\nindebtedness would prevent us from complying with our financial covenants. If we are unable to borrow additional\ncapital or have sufficient liquidity to either repay or refinance the then outstanding balance at the expiration of our credit\nfacility, or upon violation of the covenants, our growth could be impeded and our financial performance could be\nsignificantly adversely affected.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long-term non-cancelable leases, as well as\nrisks related to renewal.\nThe majority of our company restaurants are located on leased premises. Additional sites that we lease are likely to\nbe subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. In connection with the relocation, other operational changes or\nclosure of any restaurant, we may nonetheless be committed to perform on our obligations under the applicable lease\n21\nincluding, among other things, paying the base rent and real estate taxes for the balance of the lease term. We also are\nsubject to landlord actions that could negatively impact our business or operations.\nIn addition, as each of our leases expires, there can be no assurance we will be able to renew our expiring leases\nafter the expiration of all remaining renewal options, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all. As a result, at\nthe end of the lease term and expiration of all renewal periods, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial\nadditional cost, if at all. As a result, we may be required to relocate or close a restaurant, which could subject us to\nconstruction and other costs and risks and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be required to record additional impairment charges in the future.\nIn accordance with accounting guidance as it relates to the impairment of long-lived assets, we make certain\nestimates and projections with regard to company restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection\nwith our impairment analysis for long-lived assets. When impairment triggers are deemed to exist for any company\nrestaurant, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the restaurant are compared to its carrying value. If the\ncarrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge would be recorded equal to the difference\nbetween the carrying value and the estimated fair value.\nWe review the value of our goodwill on an annual basis and also when events or changes in circumstances indicate\nthat the carrying value of goodwill may exceed its fair value. The estimates of fair value are based upon the best\ninformation available as of the date of the assessment and incorporate management assumptions about expected future\ncash flows and contemplate other valuation measurements and techniques.\nThe estimates of fair value used in these analyses require the use of judgment, certain assumptions and estimates of\nfuture operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates or assumptions, additional impairment charges may be\nrequired in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Consumer Discretionary Spending and Macroeconomic Conditions\nChanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the popularity of our food products. Continued social concerns or shifts in\nconsumer preferences away from our restaurants or food offerings, particularly beef, could harm our business.\nConsumer preferences regarding food sourcing in response to environmental or welfare concerns could also harm our\nbusiness. Additionally, our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is\ninfluenced by general economic conditions, including high inflationary periods, and the availability of discretionary\nincome. Accordingly, we may experience declines in sales during economic downturns, pandemics or other periods of\nuncertainty. Any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur objective to increase sales and profits at existing restaurants could be adversely affected by macroeconomic\nconditions.\nIn future periods, the U.S. and global economies could further suffer from a downturn in economic activity.\nRecessionary economic cycles, higher interest rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, sustained labor inflation,\nincreases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other\nchanges in tax laws, financial market volatility, social unrest, government spending, a low or stagnant pace of economic\nrecovery and growth, or other economic factors that may affect consumer spending or buying habits could adversely\naffect the demand for our products. In addition, there is no assurance that any governmental plans to stimulate the\neconomy will foster growth in consumer spending or buying habits. As in the past, we could experience reduced guest\ntraffic or we may be unable or unwilling to increase the prices we charge for our products to offset higher costs or fewer\ntransactions, either of which could reduce our sales and profit margins. Also, landlords or other tenants in the shopping\ncenters in which some of our restaurants are located may experience difficulty as a result of macroeconomic trends or\ncease to operate, which could in turn negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a\nmaterial adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\n22\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Litigation\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary to operate our restaurants and compliance\nwith governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating\nto the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. Such regulations are subject to change from time to time, sometimes\nwithout notice to us. The failure to obtain and maintain these licenses, permits and approvals, including liquor licenses,\ncould adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failure to obtain the required licenses and approvals could\ndelay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may revoke, suspend or deny\nrenewal of our liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations.\nIn addition to our having to comply with these licensing requirements, various federal and state labor laws govern\nour relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum and tipped wage\nrequirements, overtime pay, health benefits, unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation, work eligibility requirements\nand working conditions. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including:\n• additional government-imposed increases in minimum and/or tipped wages, hourly and overtime pay, paid\nleaves of absence, sick leave, and mandated health benefits;\n• increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive gratuities;\n• any failure of our employees to comply with laws and regulations governing work authorization or residency\nrequirements resulting in disruption of our work force and adverse publicity;\n• a reduction in the number of states that allow gratuities to be credited toward minimum wage requirements, or\na federal mandate prohibiting such credits; and\n• increased litigation including claims under federal and/or state wage and hour laws.\nThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public\naccommodations and employment. Although our restaurants and other places of accommodation are designed to be\naccessible to the disabled, we could be required to make unexpected modifications to provide service to, or make\nreasonable accommodations, for disabled persons.\nWe are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us.\nIncreasing legal complexity will continue to affect our operations and results. We could be subject to legal\nproceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government\ninvestigations, employment and personal injury claims, claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding\nconsumer, workplace and employment matters, wage and hour claims, discrimination and similar matters,\nlandlord/tenant disputes, disputes with current and former suppliers, claims by current and former franchisees, data\nprivacy claims and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed upon another party’s trademarks,\ncopyrights or patents). Additionally, we are subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and NASDAQ\nreporting and disclosure requirements. Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect\nour business and increase our exposure to litigation which could result in significant judgments, including punitive and\nliquidated damages, and injunctive relief.\nOccasionally, our guests file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for an illness or\ninjury they suffered as a result of a visit to our restaurants, or that we have problems with food quality or operations. As\na Company, we take responsible alcohol service seriously. However, we are subject to “dram shop” statutes. These\nstatutes generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that served\nalcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some litigation against restaurant chains has resulted in significant\njudgments, including punitive damages, under dram shop statutes. Because a plaintiff may seek punitive damages,\nwhich may not be covered by insurance, this type of action could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\n23\nLitigation involving our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for\nemployment law purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our\nfranchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.\nOur operating results could also be affected by the following:\n• The relative level of our defense costs and nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;\n• The cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make\ndisclosures or to take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brands and products;\n• Adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and\npreparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication\npractices; and\n• The scope and terms of insurance or indemnification protections that we may have (if any).\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend\nand may divert time, attention and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly\nin excess of any applicable insurance coverage could have significant adverse effect on our financial condition or results\nof operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these claims may hurt our business.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses\nwe may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such damages\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or liquidity. In addition, we self-insure a\nsignificant portion of expected losses under our health, workers’ compensation, general liability, employment practices\nliability, cybersecurity and property insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in our claims experience and/or the\nactuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for these losses could result in significantly\ndifferent amounts of expense under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and liquidity. Additionally, if our insurance costs increase, there can be no assurance we\nwill be able to successfully offset the effect of such increases and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are primarily subject to federal, state and local income and other taxes in the United States. Our effective\nincome tax rate and other taxes in the future could be affected by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation\nof deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or other legislative changes and the outcome of income tax\naudits. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in and/or interpretations of income tax laws or\nunfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial\ncondition or liquidity.\nFailure to adequately address environmental, social and/or governance (“ESG “) matters could adversely affect our\nbrand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nEntities across all industries are facing increased interest related to ESG matters including packaging and waste,\nanimal health and welfare, human rights, climate change, greenhouse gases and land, energy and water use. In addition,\nwe have faced enhanced pressure to provide expanded disclosures around ESG matters and establish goals or targets\nwith respect to ESG matters. In response to the heightened level of expectation for expanded ESG disclosure, we have\npublished a Corporate Sustainability Report detailing our ESG efforts and which we update regularly.\nEvolving consumer and investor interest and preferences as well as governmental regulation may result in\nadditional disclosure, due diligence, reporting and specific target-setting with regard to our business and supply chain\nthat could result in additional costs to comply with such demands. Failure to comply with the increased demands could\nresult in consumer or investor scrutiny and/or litigation and could have an adverse effect on our business. Establishing\ntargets or making other public commitments due to these demands, without a full or complete understanding of the cost\nor operational impact of changes in our supply chain or operating model, could also adversely affect our business and\nfinancial condition.\n24\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nFailure to retain the services of our key management personnel, or to successfully execute succession planning and\nattract additional qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur future success depends on the continued services and performance of our key management personnel and our\nability to develop future successors of such personnel as a part of our succession planning. Our future performance will\ndepend on our ability to motivate and retain these and other key officers, employees and managers, particularly regional\nmarket partners, market partners and managing partners. Competition for these employees is intense. The unplanned\nloss of the services of members of our senior management team or other key officers or managers or the inability to\nattract additional qualified personnel as needed could significantly harm our business. In addition, our business could\nsuffer from any actual or alleged misconduct of any of our key personnel.\nOur business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting\nand training our restaurant managers and hourly employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, unionization,\nincreased minimum and tipped wages, changes in hourly and overtime pay, state unemployment rates, sick pay or other\nemployee benefits costs (including workers’ compensation and health insurance), company staffing initiatives or\notherwise any regulatory changes resulting from any of the foregoing would adversely impact our operating expenses.\nIn addition, failure to adequately monitor and proactively respond to employee dissatisfaction could lead to poor guest\nsatisfaction, higher turnover, litigation and unionization efforts, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIncreased competition for qualified employees caused by a shortage in the labor pool exerts upward pressure on\nwages paid to attract and retain such personnel, resulting in higher labor costs, together with greater recruitment and\ntraining expense. We could suffer from significant indirect costs, including restaurant disruptions due to management or\nhourly labor turnover and potential delays in new restaurant openings. A shortage in the labor pool could also cause our\nrestaurants to be required to operate with reduced staff which could negatively impact our ability to provide adequate\nservice levels to our guests resulting in adverse guest reactions and a possible reduction in guest traffic counts.\nAdditionally, personal or public health concerns might make some existing personnel or potential candidates reluctant to\nwork in enclosed restaurant environments.\nWe have many restaurants located in states or municipalities where the minimum and/or tipped wage is greater than\nthe federal minimum and/or tipped wage. We anticipate that additional legislation increasing minimum and/or tipped\nwage standards will be enacted in future periods either federally or in state and local jurisdictions. In addition,\nregulatory actions which result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design and cost structure could occur. Any increases\nin minimum and/or tipped wages or increases in employee benefits costs will result in sustained higher labor costs.\nOur operating margin will be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable or are unwilling to offset any\nincrease in these labor costs through higher prices on our products. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected\nby higher minimum wage and benefit standards which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our growth\nstrategy. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations may also be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Technology, Privacy and Intellectual Property\nWe rely heavily on information technology, and any material failure, weakness, ransomware or interruption could\nprevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe rely heavily on information systems in all aspects of our operations, including point-of-sale systems, digital\napps, financial systems, marketing programs, e-commerce and various other processes and transactions. This reliance\nhas significantly increased in recent years as we have had to rely to a greater extent on systems such as online ordering,\ncontactless payments, online waitlists, and systems supporting a more remote workforce as our guests are increasingly\nusing our website and digital applications to place and pay for their orders. Our point-of-sale processing in our\nrestaurants includes collection of cash, credit cards, debit cards, gift cards and other processes and procedures. Our\nability to efficiently and effectively manage our business depends significantly on the reliability, security and capacity of\nthese systems. As our business needs continue to evolve, these systems will require upgrading and maintenance over\ntime, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital. Additionally, as we become\n25\nincreasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel, our business could be negatively impacted if we\nare unable to successfully implement, execute or maintain our consumer-facing digital initiatives.\nThe failure of these systems to operate effectively, maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new\nplatforms or a material breach in the security of these systems could result in delays or errors to guest service and reduce\nefficiency in our operations. In addition, as we implement new technology platforms to improve productivity and\noverall guest experience, there can be no guarantees that these platforms will operate as reliably or be as operationally\nimpactful as intended.\nWe have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address events of a crisis nature,\nincluding tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms\nof data information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience\ndelays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance,\nfailures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures\nthat could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and exposure to administrative\nand other legal claims.\nOur ability to expand and update our information technology infrastructure in response to our growing and\nchanging needs would be inhibited in the event of a cybersecurity incident. This could lead to a delayed implementation\nof new service offerings, disruptions to guest experiences including via our website and applications and the diversion of\nresources that would otherwise be invested in expanding our business and operations. Additionally, we could be subject\nto litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any such failure. Any such claim or proceeding could\ncause us to incur significant unplanned expenses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could have a material\nimpact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if there are malfunctions or other problems with\nour processing vendors, billing software or payment processing systems, it may cause interruption of normal business\nperformance. These vendors may also experience interruptions to their information technology systems that could\nadversely affect us and which we may have limited or no control.\nWe outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in\nbusiness and increased costs.\nSome business processes are currently outsourced to third parties, including such processes as information\ntechnology, gift card tracking, credit and debit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing,\nunemployment claims processing, payroll tax filings, vendor payment processing and other accounting processes. We\ncontinually evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable, and the most\nappropriate, option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to validate that all providers of outsourced\nservices maintain customary internal controls, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks\nto guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third\nparties to provide adequate services or internal controls over their processes could have an adverse effect on our results\nof operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.\nWe may incur increased costs to comply with privacy and data protection laws and, if we fail to comply or our systems\nare compromised by a security breach, we could be subject to government enforcement actions, private litigation and\nadverse publicity.\nNew, modified and existing privacy and data protection laws and regulations may result in significant costs and\ncompliance challenges and adversely affect our business and financial condition. These privacy laws and regulations,\nwhich are constantly evolving, may be interpreted by regulatory authorities in new and differing manners, including the\nissuing of rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or increase penalties, and such interpretations may be\ninconsistent among jurisdictions. We may incur increased costs to comply with increasingly demanding privacy laws\nand regulations and such compliance may impede the development and offering of new products or services and may\nadversely impact the guest experience. We could also be subject to government enforcement actions, private litigation\nand adverse publicity including reputational damage and loss of guest confidence.\nWe receive and maintain certain personal, financial or other information about our guests, vendors and employees.\nIn 2023, approximately 88% of our transactions were by credit or debit cards. In addition, certain of our vendors receive\nand/or maintain certain personal, financial and other information about our employees and guests on our behalf. The use\nand handling, including security, of this information is regulated by privacy and data protection laws and regulations in\n26\nvarious jurisdictions, as well as by certain third-party contracts, frameworks and industry standards, such as the Payment\nCard Industry Data Security Standard. Hardware, software or other applications we develop and procure from third\nparties or vendor’s third-party applications could be subject to vulnerabilities or cybersecurity incidents or may contain\ndefects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security.\nUnauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems and facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms\nof deceiving our employees or vendors.\nIn addition, if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss,\ncybersecurity incident or a network security incident, or if our employees or vendors (or other persons or entities with\nwhich we do business with) fail to comply with such laws and regulations or fail to meet industry standards and this\ninformation is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could result in liabilities and penalties and\ncould damage our reputation, cause interruption of normal business performance, cause us to incur substantial costs and\nresult in a loss of guest confidence, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure or inability to enforce our trademarks or other proprietary rights could adversely affect our competitive\nposition or the value of our brand.\nWe own certain common law trademark rights and a number of federal and international trademark and service\nmark registrations, including our trade names and logos, and proprietary rights relating to certain of our core menu\nofferings. We believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive\nposition. Therefore, we devote appropriate resources to the protection of our trademarks and proprietary rights.\nHowever, the protective actions that we take may not be enough to prevent unauthorized usage or imitation by others,\nwhich could harm our image, brand or competitive position and, if we commence litigation to enforce our rights, cause\nus to incur significant legal fees. Our inability to register or protect our marks and other proprietary rights in foreign\njurisdictions could adversely affect our competitive position in international markets.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that our trademarks or menu offerings infringe upon their\nproprietary rights. Any such claim, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation,\ncause delays in introducing new menu items in the future or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As\na result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or\nliquidity.\nRisks Related to the Restaurant Industry\nChanges in food and supply costs and/or availability of products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs and/or the\navailability of products necessary to operate our business, including increased costs arising from federal and/or state\nmandated requirements. Any increase in food prices or loss of supply, particularly proteins, could adversely affect our\noperating results. In addition, we are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such\nas food supply constrictions, weather conditions, food safety concerns, global pandemics, product recalls, global market\nand trade conditions, and government regulations. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to\nchanging food costs and/or loss of supply by adjusting our purchasing practices, menu prices or menu offerings, and a\nfailure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. Extreme and/or long term increases in commodity prices\ncould adversely affect our future results, especially if we are unable, primarily due to competitive reasons, to increase\nmenu prices. Additionally, if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase\nmenu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost\nincreases, our short-term results could be negatively affected. Also, if we adjust pricing there is no assurance that we\nwill realize the full benefit of any adjustment due to changes in our guests’ menu item selections and guest traffic.\nWe currently purchase our beef primarily from four beef suppliers coming from the United States or Canada.\nWhile we maintain relationships with additional suppliers, if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations\nunder its contracts, we could encounter supply shortages and/or incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies, either of\nwhich would harm our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to compete with many food service businesses.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We compete with many well-established food service companies\non the basis of taste, quality and price of products offered, guest service, atmosphere, location, take-out and delivery\n27\noptions and overall guest experience. Our competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and\nindividual restaurants that range from independent local operators that have opened restaurants in various markets to\nwell-capitalized national restaurant chains. We also face competition from meal kit delivery services as well as the\nsupermarket industry. In addition, improving product offerings of fast casual and quick-service restaurants, together\nwith negative economic conditions could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. As our competitors\nexpand their operations, we expect competition to intensify. We also compete with other restaurant chains and other\nretail establishments for quality site locations and employees. Additionally, our competitors may generate or better\nimplement business strategies that improve the value and the relevance of their brands and reputation, relative to ours.\nThis could include the testing of delivery via internal or third-party methods or better execution around guests’ to-go\nexperience.\nThe food service industry is affected by litigation and publicity concerning food quality, health and other issues,\nwhich can cause guests to avoid our restaurants and result in significant liabilities or litigation costs.\nFood service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from guests, consumer groups or\ngovernment authorities resulting from food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming\nfrom one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect\nus, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging guests from eating at our restaurants. We could also\nincur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us or litigation costs regardless of the result.\nHealth, social and environmental concerns relating to the consumption or sourcing of beef or other food products\ncould affect consumer preferences and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nLike other restaurant chains, consumer preferences could be affected by concerns about the consumption or\nsourcing of beef, the key ingredient in many of our menu items, or negative publicity concerning food quality and food\nsafety, including food-borne illnesses. In addition, consumer preferences may be impacted by current and future menu-\nlabeling requirements or social and environmental concerns about the sourcing of food products throughout our supply\nchain. Future regulatory action may occur which could result in further changes in the nutritional and environmental\ndisclosure requirements. We cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in\nconsumer perceptions and to adapt our menu offerings to prevailing trends. The imposition of menu-labeling and food\nsourcing laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as\nthe restaurant industry in general. The labeling and sourcing requirements and any negative publicity concerning any of\nthe food products we serve may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to\nour restaurants. If we react to labeling or sourcing requirements or negative publicity by changing our concepts or our\nmenu offerings or their ingredients, we may lose guests who do not prefer the new concept or products, and we may not\nbe able to attract sufficient new guests to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we\nmay have different or additional competitors for our intended guests as a result of a change in our concept and may not\nbe able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as a result of\nthese health, social and environmental concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept\ncould significantly harm our business.\nFood safety and sanitation, food-borne illness and health concerns may have an adverse effect on our business by\nreducing demand and increasing costs.\nFood safety and sanitation is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to help our guests enjoy safe,\nquality food products. However, food-borne illnesses and food safety issues occur in the food industry from time to\ntime. Any report or publicity, whether true or not, linking us to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety\nissues, including food tampering or contamination, could adversely affect our concepts and reputation as well as results\nof operations. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at\nrestaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the food service industry generally and adversely\nimpact our revenue and profits.\nFurthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness\nincidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a\nsingle restaurant. While we attempt to minimize the risk, we cannot assure that all food items are properly maintained\nduring transport throughout the supply chain and that our employees will identify all products that may be spoiled and\nshould not be used in our restaurants. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to\n28\ntemporarily close some restaurants. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination, whether or not at our restaurants,\ncould subject us or our suppliers to a food recall.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries have experienced, or may experience in the future, outbreaks of\nviruses, such as COVID-19, Hepatitis A, Norovirus, Ebola, Avian Flu, SARS and H1N1. To the extent that a virus is\nfood-borne, future outbreaks may adversely affect the price and availability of certain food products and cause our\nguests to eat less of a product which may have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by our inability to respond to or effectively manage social media.\nAs part of our marketing strategy, we utilize social media platforms to promote our concepts and attract and retain\nguests. Our strategy may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without improvement in guest traffic or brand\nrelevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including improper disclosure of\nproprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or\ndissemination of false information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could\nincrease our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation and adversely affect\nour results of operations.\nGiven the marked increase in the use of social media platforms, individuals have access to a broad audience of\nconsumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate\nas is its impact. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post,\noften without filters or checks on the accuracy of the content posted. Information concerning our Company may be\nposted on such platforms at any time. This includes posts by social media influencers that have a significant number of\nfollowers and reach on the variety of social media platforms. Additionally, social media has increasingly been utilized\nto target specific companies or brands as a result of a variety of actions or inactions, or perceived actions or inactions,\nthat are disfavored by interest groups and such campaigns can rapidly accelerate and impact consumer behavior. If we\nare unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic. The impact may be\nimmediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. These factors could have a material adverse\nimpact on our business.\nRisks Related to Stock Ownership and Our Corporate Structure\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third\nparty to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board. These provisions include, among other things, advance\nnotice for raising business or making nominations at meetings and “blank check” preferred stock. Blank check preferred\nstock enables our Board, without approval of the shareholders, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock\nwith such dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, including the right to issue convertible securities with\nno limitations on conversion, as our Board may determine. The issuance of blank check preferred stock may adversely\naffect the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock as our Board may designate and issue preferred\nstock with terms that are senior to our common stock. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a\nthird party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a\nmerger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders\nreceiving a premium over the market price for their common stock. If we issue preferred shares in the future that have a\npreference over our common stock with respect to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we\nissue preferred shares with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of our common\nstockholders or the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits us from engaging in “business combinations” with “interested\nshareholders” (with some exceptions) unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner. The existence of this\nprovision could have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board,\nincluding discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase our common\nstock up to the maximum amounts permitted under our previously announced repurchase program.\nPayment of cash dividends on our common stock or repurchases of our common stock are subject to compliance\nwith applicable laws and depends on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of\n29\nindebtedness, capital requirements, business prospects, macro-economic conditions and other factors that our Board may\ndeem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock at the\nsame levels we have historically (if at all).\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could\nimpact the trading value of our common stock.\nWe value constructive input from our shareholders and the investment community. Our Board and management\nteam are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our shareholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken\nby our Board and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our shareholders will be successful.\nResponding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and\ndiverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our\nstrategic plan. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also resulting from activist strategies could also\naffect the market price and volatility of our common stock.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may negatively impact our\nbusiness and our financial results.\nThe Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.\nThis includes establishing controls around the adoption of new, or changes in existing, accounting policies and practices.\nDespite its inherent limitations, effective internal control over financial reporting helps provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes. A significant accounting error correction, financial\nreporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause results in our consolidated\nfinancial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, a loss of investor confidence and subsequent\ndecline in the market price of our common stock, increase our costs and regulatory scrutiny, and lead to litigation or\nresult in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nIn the course of our operations, the Company receives and maintains sensitive information from our guests,\nemployees, partners and business operations. To address cybersecurity threats to this information, the Company uses a\nrisk-based approach to create and implement a detailed set of information security policies and procedures based on\nframeworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The Company’s Head of Information\nSecurity leads the Company’s cybersecurity efforts under the direct oversight of our Chief Technology Officer.\nTogether, these individuals have over 50 years of experience involving information technology, including security,\nauditing, compliance, systems and programming. Additionally, the Company engages in the use of external\ncybersecurity experts for training, contingency planning, consultation and process documentation.\nThe Company has implemented detective and preventative controls designed to ensure the appropriate level of\nprotection for the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data stored on or transferred through our information\ntechnology resources. The Company has a risk assessment process to identify risks associated with our use of third-\nparty service providers and has implemented specific processes and controls designed to mitigate those identified risks.\nBoth internal and third-party audits are performed routinely to verify that these controls are effective. Additionally, the\nCompany has implemented trainings designed to provide best practices for protecting our network and systems, and also\nroutinely leads exercises for employees to reinforce the risk and proper handling of targeted emails. The Company’s\nHead of Information Security is responsible for developing and implementing these controls and training exercises with\nsupport from our information technology department.\nThe Company’s enterprise risk management program has established an internal risk committee to evaluate\ninformation governance risks. This committee comprises members of management of the Company’s information\ntechnology, human resources, marketing, accounting, risk, procurement, training, finance and legal functions, and is\nfocused on performing risk assessments to identify areas of concern and implement appropriate changes to enhance its\n30\ncybersecurity and privacy policies and procedures. The internal risk committee is informed of the Company’s risk\nprevention and mitigation efforts on a regular basis. The committee is also briefed on detection and remediation of\ncybersecurity incidents in a timely manner following the detection of any potential events.\nThe Company has a crisis response team comprising senior members of various corporate functions to oversee the\nresponse to various crises including potential crises arising from cybersecurity incidents that may impact the Company\nand/or its vendor partners. This team conducts regular tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity\nincidents. To the extent there is a cybersecurity incident impacting the Company and/or a vendor partner, the crisis\nresponse team’s process would be to ensure that our Head of Information Security and Chief Technology Officer are\ninformed immediately and that the potential impact of the incident and remedial measures arising from the incident are\ncommunicated to the executive officers of the Company.\nThere can be no guarantee that our policies and procedures will be effective. Although our risk factors include\nfurther detail about the material cybersecurity risks we face and how a cybersecurity incident may affect our business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial condition, we believe that risks from prior cybersecurity threats, including as a\nresult of any previous cybersecurity incident, have not materially affected our business to date. We can provide no\nassurances that there will not be incidents in the future or that they will not materially affect us, including our business\nstrategy, results of operations or financial condition.\nGovernance\nThe Board has authorized the audit committee to oversee the Company’s risk assessment and risk management\npractices and strategies. This delegation includes maintaining responsibility for overseeing the Company’s enterprise\nrisk management program. As a part of this oversight role, the audit committee receives regular updates from\nmanagement on cybersecurity and privacy risks impacting the Company, which includes benchmarking these risks\nversus our industry. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on cybersecurity-related\nnews events, receive training specific to cybersecurity risks and threats and regularly discuss any updates to our\ncybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.\n31\nITEM 2.

From inception through December 26, 2023, we\nhave paid $683.5 million through our authorized stock repurchase programs to repurchase 21,496,468 shares of our\ncommon stock at an average price per share of $31.80. On March 17, 2022, the Board approved a stock repurchase\nprogram under which we may repurchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock. This stock repurchase program has\nno expiration date. All repurchases to date have been made through open market transactions. In 2023, we paid $50.0\nmillion to repurchase 455,026 shares of our common stock. For the 13 weeks ended December 26, 2023, we paid $4.8\nmillion to repurchase 40,707 shares of our common stock.

RESERVED\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\nThe discussion and analysis below of the financial condition and results of operations for Texas Roadhouse, Inc.\n(the “Company,” “we,” “our” and/or “us”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and\nthe notes to such financial statements (pages F-1 to F-29), “Forward-looking Statements” (page 3) and Risk Factors set\nforth in Item 1A. For discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2022\ncompared to fiscal year 2021, see Part II, Item 7 of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Company\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. is a growing restaurant company operating predominantly in the casual dining segment. Our\nlate founder, W. Kent Taylor, started the business in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in\nClarksville, Indiana. Since then, we have grown to three concepts with 741 restaurants in 49 states and ten foreign\ncountries. As of December 26, 2023, our 741 restaurants included:\n• 635 company restaurants, of which 615 were wholly-owned and 20 were majority-owned. The results of\noperations of company restaurants are included in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive\nincome. The portion of income attributable to noncontrolling interests in company restaurants that are\nmajority-owned is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our\nconsolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Of the 635 company restaurants, we operated\n582 as Texas Roadhouse restaurants, 45 as Bubba’s 33 restaurants and eight as Jaggers restaurants.\n• 106 franchise restaurants, of which 20 we have a 5.0% to 10.0% ownership interest. The income derived from\nour minority interests in these franchise restaurants is reported in the line item equity income (loss) from\ninvestments in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nOf the 106 franchise restaurants, 56 were domestic Texas Roadhouse restaurants, two were domestic Jaggers\nrestaurants and 48 were international Texas Roadhouse restaurants.\nWe have contractual arrangements that grant us the right to acquire at pre-determined formulas the remaining\ninterests in 18 of the 20 majority-owned company restaurants and 53 of the 58 domestic franchise restaurants.\nThroughout this report, we use the term “restaurants” to include Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33, unless\notherwise noted.\nPresentation of Financial and Operating Data\nWe operate on a fiscal year that ends on the last Tuesday in December. Fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2022 were\nboth 52 weeks in length, and the fourth quarters were both 13 weeks in length.\nLong-term Strategies to Grow Earnings Per Share and Create Shareholder Value\nOur long-term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share, along with creating\nshareholder value, include the following:\n• Expanding Our Restaurant Base. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop restaurants in existing\nmarkets and in new domestic and international markets. Domestically, we remain focused primarily on\nmarkets where we believe a significant demand for our restaurants exists because of population size, income\nlevels, the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base. In addition, we\ncontinue to pursue opportunities to acquire domestic franchise locations to expand our company restaurant\nbase.\nWe have entered into area development and franchise agreements for the development and operation of Texas\nRoadhouse restaurants in numerous foreign countries and one U.S. territory. We have also entered into area\ndevelopment agreements for Jaggers, our fast-casual concept. We opened our first two Jaggers franchise\nrestaurants in 2023.\nIn 2023, we opened 30 company restaurants while our franchise partners opened 15 restaurants. The company\nrestaurants included 22 Texas Roadhouse restaurants, five Bubba’s 33 restaurants, and three Jaggers\n36\nrestaurants. The franchise restaurants included ten international Texas Roadhouse restaurants, three domestic\nTexas Roadhouse restaurants and two domestic Jaggers restaurants.\nIn 2023, we also completed the acquisition of eight domestic franchise Texas Roadhouse restaurants for an\naggregate purchase price of $39.1 million.\n• Maintaining and/or Improving Restaurant Level Profitability. We continue to focus on driving comparable\nrestaurant sales to maintain or improve restaurant level profitability. This includes a pricing strategy that\nbalances the impacts of inflationary pressures with our long-term value positioning. In terms of driving traffic\nat our restaurants, we remain focused on encouraging repeat visits by our guests and attracting new guests\nthrough our continued commitment to operational standards relating to food and service quality. To attract\nnew guests and increase the frequency of visits of our existing guests, we continue to drive various localized\nmarketing programs, focus on speed of service and kitchen efficiency, increase throughput by adding seats and\nparking at certain restaurants and continue to enhance the guest digital experience.\nAt our high volume restaurants, we continue to look for opportunities to increase our dining room capacity by\nadding on to our existing building and/or to increase our parking capacity by leasing or purchasing property\nthat adjoins our site. We also continue to make a number of building modifications and/or expansions to\nexisting restaurants in order to better accommodate increased dine-in and to-go sales. These modifications\ninclude room expansions which add additional guest seating, the addition of to-go areas and cooler expansions\nto accommodate higher inventory levels.\nIn recent years, we have relocated several existing Texas Roadhouse locations at or near the end of their\nassociated lease or as a result of eminent domain which allowed us to move to a better site, update them to a\ncurrent prototypical design, construct a larger building with more seats and greater number of available\nparking spaces, accommodate increased to-go sales and/or obtain more favorable lease terms. We continue to\nevaluate these opportunities particularly as it relates to older locations with strong sales.\n• Leveraging Our Scalable Infrastructure. To support our growth, we have made investments in our\ninfrastructure across all critical functions, including the development of new strategic initiatives. Whether we\nare able to leverage our infrastructure in future years by growing our general and administrative costs at a\nslower rate than our revenue will depend, in part, on our new restaurant openings, our comparable restaurant\nsales growth rate going forward and the level of investment we continue to make in our infrastructure.\n• Returning Capital to Shareholders. We continue to evaluate opportunities to return capital to our\nshareholders, including the payment of dividends and repurchase of common stock. In 2011, our Board\ndeclared our first quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share of common stock which has consistently grown over\ntime. In 2023, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock. On\nFebruary 14, 2024, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock,\nrepresenting an 11% increase compared to the quarterly dividend declared in the prior year period.\nIn 2008, the Board approved our first stock repurchase program. On March 17, 2022, the Board approved a\nstock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $300.0 million of our common stock. In\n2023, we paid $50.0 million to repurchase 455,026 shares of our common stock. As of December 26, 2023,\n$116.9 million remained authorized for stock repurchases. From inception through December 26, 2023, we\nhave paid $683.5 million through our authorized stock repurchase programs to repurchase 21,496,468 shares\nof our common stock at an average price per share of $31.80.\nKey Measures We Use To Evaluate Our Company\nKey measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following:\n• Comparable Restaurant Sales. Comparable restaurant sales reflect the change in sales for all company\nrestaurants across all concepts, unless otherwise noted, over the same period of the prior year for the\ncomparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for a\nfull 18 months before the beginning of the period measured excluding restaurants permanently closed during\nthe period. Comparable restaurant sales can be impacted by changes in guest traffic counts or by changes in the\n37\nper person average check amount. Menu price changes, the mix of menu items sold and the mix of dine-in\nversus to-go sales can affect the per person average check amount.\n• Average Unit Volume. Average unit volume represents the average annual restaurant sales for Texas\nRoadhouse and Bubba’s 33 restaurants open for a full six months before the beginning of the period measured\nexcluding sales of restaurants permanently closed during the period. Historically, average unit volume growth\nis less than comparable restaurant sales growth which indicates that newer restaurants are operating with sales\ngrowth levels lower than the company average. At times, average unit volume growth may be more than\ncomparable restaurant sales growth which indicates that newer restaurants are operating with sales growth\nlevels higher than company average.\n• Store Weeks and New Restaurant Openings. Store weeks represent the number of weeks that all company\nrestaurants across all concepts, unless otherwise noted, were open during the reporting period. Store weeks\ninclude weeks in which a restaurant is temporarily closed. Store week growth is driven by new restaurant\nopenings and franchise acquisitions. New restaurant openings reflect the number of restaurants opened during\na particular fiscal period, excluding store relocations. We consider store openings that occur simultaneously\nwith a store closure in the same trade area to be a relocation.\n• Restaurant Margin. Restaurant margin (in dollars, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales and per store\nweek) represents restaurant and other sales less restaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage\ncosts, labor, rent and other operating costs. Restaurant margin is not a measurement determined in accordance\nwith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered in isolation, or as\nan alternative, to income from operations. This non-GAAP measure is not indicative of overall company\nperformance and profitability in that this measure does not accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders due to\nthe nature of the costs excluded. Restaurant margin is widely regarded as a useful metric by which to evaluate\ncore restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nIn calculating restaurant margin, we exclude certain non-restaurant-level costs that support operations,\nincluding general and administrative expenses, but do not have a direct impact on restaurant-level operational\nefficiency and performance. We exclude pre-opening expense as it occurs at irregular intervals and would\nimpact comparability to prior period results. We exclude depreciation and amortization expense, substantially\nall of which relates to restaurant-level assets, as it represents a non-cash charge for the investment in our\nrestaurants. We exclude impairment and closure expense as we believe this provides a clearer perspective of\nthe Company’s ongoing operating performance and a more useful comparison to prior period results.\nRestaurant margin as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in\nour industry. A reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant margin is included in the Results of\nOperations section below.\nOther Key Definitions\nRestaurant and Other Sales. Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions and\ndiscounts, for all company restaurants. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities\nare accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from restaurant sales in our consolidated statements of\nincome and comprehensive income. Other sales include the net impact of the amortization of third-party gift card fees\nand gift card breakage income, sales related to our non-royalty based retail products and content revenue related to our\ntabletop kiosk devices.\nFranchise Royalties and Fees. Franchise royalties consist of royalties, as defined in our franchise agreement, paid\nto us by our domestic and international franchisees. Domestic and international franchisees also typically pay an initial\nfranchise fee and/or development fee for each new restaurant or territory.\nFood and Beverage Costs. Food and beverage costs consists of the costs of raw materials and ingredients used in\nthe preparation of food and beverage products sold in our company restaurants. Approximately half of our food and\nbeverage costs relate to beef.\nRestaurant Labor Expenses. Restaurant labor expenses include all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in\noperations except for profit sharing incentive compensation expenses earned by our restaurant managing partners and\n38\nmarket partners. These profit sharing expenses are reflected in restaurant other operating expenses. Restaurant labor\nexpenses also include share-based compensation expense related to restaurant-level employees.\nRestaurant Rent Expense. Restaurant rent expense includes all rent, except pre-opening rent, associated with the\nleasing of real estate and includes base, percentage and straight-line rent expense.\nRestaurant Other Operating Expenses. Restaurant other operating expenses consist of all other restaurant-level\noperating costs, the major components of which are credit card fees, profit sharing incentive compensation for our\nrestaurant managing partners and market partners, utilities, supplies, general liability insurance, advertising, repairs and\nmaintenance, property taxes and outside services.\nPre-opening Expenses. Pre-opening expenses, which are charged to operations as incurred, consist of expenses\nincurred before the opening of a new or relocated restaurant and consist principally of opening and training team\ncompensation and benefits, travel expenses, rent, food, beverage and other initial supplies and expenses. The majority of\npre-opening costs incurred relate to the hiring and training of employees due to the significant investment we make in\ntraining our people. Pre-opening costs vary by location depending on a number of factors, including the size and\nphysical layout of each location; the number of management and hourly employees required to operate each restaurant;\nthe availability of qualified restaurant staff members; the cost of travel and lodging for different geographic areas; the\ntiming of the restaurant opening; and the extent of unexpected delays, if any, in obtaining final licenses and permits to\nopen each restaurant.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses. Depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation of fixed\nassets and amortization of intangibles with definite lives, substantially all of which relates to restaurant-level assets.\nImpairment and Closure Costs, Net. Impairment and closure costs, net include any impairment of long-lived assets,\nincluding property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and goodwill, and expenses associated with the\nclosure of a restaurant. Closure costs also include any gains or losses associated with a relocated restaurant or the sale of\na closed restaurant and/or assets held for sale as well as lease costs associated with closed or relocated restaurants.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses comprise expenses associated with\ncorporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations and provide an infrastructure\nto support future growth. This includes salary, incentive-based and share-based compensation expense related to\nexecutive officers and Support Center employees, salary and share-based compensation expense related to market\npartners, software hosting fees, professional fees, group insurance, advertising expense and the realized and unrealized\nholding gains and losses related to the investments in our deferred compensation plan.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net. Interest income (expense), net includes earnings on cash and cash equivalents and\nis reduced by interest expense, net of capitalized interest, on our debt or financing obligations including the amortization\nof loan fees.\nEquity Income from Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Equity income includes our percentage share of net\nincome earned by unconsolidated affiliates and our share of any gain on the acquisition of these affiliates. As of\nDecember 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, we owned a 5.0% to 10.0% equity interest in 20 and 23 domestic franchise\nrestaurants, respectively.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents\nthe portion of income attributable to the other owners of the majority-owned restaurants. Our consolidated subsidiaries\ninclude 20 majority-owned restaurants for all periods presented.\n2023 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue increased $616.8 million or 15.4% to $4.6 billion in 2023 compared to $4.0 billion in 2022 primarily\ndue to an increase in comparable restaurant sales and an increase in store weeks. Comparable restaurant sales and store\nweeks increased 10.1% and 5.8%, respectively, at company restaurants in 2023. The increase in comparable restaurant\nsales was due to an increase in guest traffic along with an increase in per person average check. The increase in store\nweeks was due to new store openings and the acquisition of franchise restaurants.\nNet income increased $35.1 million or 13.0% to $304.9 million in 2023 compared to $269.8 million in 2022\nprimarily due to higher restaurant margin dollars, as described below, partially offset by higher general and\n39\nadministrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. Diluted earnings per share increased 14.3%\nto $4.54 from $3.97 in the prior year primarily due to the increase in net income.\nRestaurant margin dollars increased $80.5 million or 12.8% to $708.0 million in 2023 compared to $627.5 million\nin 2022 primarily due to higher sales. Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased to\n15.4% in 2023 compared to 15.7% in 2022. The decrease in restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other\nsales, was due to commodity inflation, wage and other labor inflation and higher general liability insurance expense\npartially offset by higher sales.\nWe repurchased 455,026 shares of common stock for $50.0 million in 2023. We also paid a quarterly dividend of\n$0.55 per share of common stock, which totaled $147.2 million.\n40\nResults o f Op erations\nFiscal Year Ended\n2023 2022\n$ % $ %\n(In thousands)\nConsolidated Statements of Income:\nRevenue:\nRestaurant and other sales ..................... 4,604,554 99.4 3,988,791 99.3\nFranchise royalties and fees .................... 27,118 0.6 26,128 0.7\nTotal revenue .................................. 4,631,672 100.0 4,014,919 100.0\nCosts and expenses:\n(As a percentage of restaurant and other sales)\nRestaurant operating costs (excluding depreciation\nand amortization shown separately below):\nFood and beverage .......................... 1,593,852 34.6 1,378,192 34.6\nLabor .................................... 1,539,124 33.4 1,319,959 33.1\nRent ..................................... 72,766 1.6 66,834 1.7\nOther operating ............................ 690,848 15.0 596,305 14.9\n(As a percentage of total revenue)\nPre-opening ................................ 29,234 0.6 21,883 0.5\nDepreciation and amortization .................. 153,202 3.3 137,237 3.4\nImpairment and closure, net .................... 275 NM 1,600 NM\nGeneral and administrative ..................... 198,382 4.3 172,712 4.3\nTotal costs and expenses ......................... 4,277,683 92.4 3,694,722 92.0\nIncome from operations .......................... 353,989 7.6 320,197 8.0\nInterest income (expense), net ..................... 2,984 0.1 (124) NM\nEquity income from investments in unconsolidated\naffiliates .................................... 1,351 NM 1,239 NM\nIncome before taxes ............................. 358,324 7.7 321,312 8.0\nIncome tax expense ............................. 44,649 1.0 43,715 1.1\nNet income including noncontrolling interests ........ 313,675 6.8 277,597 6.9\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests ..... 8,799 0.2 7,779 0.2\nNet income attributable to Texas Roadhouse, Inc. and\nsubsidiaries .................................. 304,876 6.6 269,818 6.7\nNM – Not meaningful\n41\nReconciliation of Income from Operations to Restaurant Margin\nFiscal Year Ended\n2023 2022\n(In thousands, except per store week)\nIncome from operations ............................ $ 353,989 $ 320,197\nLess:\nFranchise royalties and fees ......................... 27,118 26,128\nAdd:\nPre-opening ..................................... 29,234 21,883\nDepreciation and amortization ....................... 153,202 137,237\nImpairment and closure, net ........................ 275 1,600\nGeneral and administrative ......................... 198,382 172,712\nRestaurant margin ................................ $ 707,964 $ 627,501\nRestaurant margin $/store week ...................... $ 22,090 $ 20,721\nRestaurant margin (as a percentage of restaurant and\nother sales) .................................... 15.4 % 15.7 %\nRestaurant Unit Activity\nTexas\nTotal Roadhouse Bubba’s 33 Jaggers\nBalance at December 27, 2022 ............................... 697 652 40 5\nCompany openings ........................................ 30 22 5 3\nFranchise openings - Domestic .............................. 5 3 — 2\nFranchise openings - International ............................ 10 10 — —\nFranchise closings ........................................

The increase in store weeks was driven by the opening of new restaurants and the\nacquisition of franchise restaurants. The increase in comparable restaurant sales growth was driven by an increase in\nguest traffic count along with an increase in our per person average check as shown in the table below.\n2023 2022\nGuest traffic counts ............................................................ 5.4 % 1.9 %\nPer person average check ....................................................... 4.7 % 7.8 %\nComparable restaurant sales growth .............................................. 10.1 % 9.7 %\n43\nThe increase in 2023 guest traffic counts was driven by an increase in dining room traffic. To-go sales as a\npercentage of restaurant sales were 12.6% in 2023 compared to 13.3% in 2022 and average weekly to-go sales were\n$18,088 in 2023 compared to $17,504 in 2022.\nPer person average check includes the benefit of menu price increases of approximately 2.2% and 2.7%\nimplemented in Q2 2023 and Q4 2023, respectively, as well as increases of 3.2% and 2.9% implemented in Q2 2022 and\nQ4 2022, respectively.\nIn 2023, we opened 30 company restaurants, which included 22 Texas Roadhouse restaurants, five Bubba’s\n33 restaurants and three Jaggers restaurants. We also completed the acquisition of eight domestic Texas Roadhouse\nfranchise restaurants.\nIn 2024, we expect store week growth of approximately 8% across all concepts, including a benefit of 2% from the\n53rd week.\nOther sales include the net impact of the amortization of third-party gift card fees and gift card breakage income,\nsales related to our non-royalty based retail products and content revenue related to our tabletop kiosk devices. The net\nimpact of these amounts was $(12.7) million and $(6.4) million for 2023 and 2022, respectively. The change was driven\nprimarily by increased third-party gift card fee amortization from increased gift card sales and a decrease in our breakage\nadjustment recorded in 2023 of $3.7 million compared to $6.6 million recorded in 2022. The breakage adjustment\nrelates to a change in our estimate of breakage due to a shift in our historic redemption pattern which indicated that the\npercentage of gift cards sold that are not expected to be redeemed had increased.\nFranchise Royalties and Fees\nFranchise royalties and fees increased by $1.0 million or 3.8% compared to 2022 primarily due to comparable\nrestaurant sales growth and new store openings partially offset by decreased royalties related to the eight franchise\nrestaurants acquired in 2023. Franchise comparable restaurant sales increased 9.6% in 2023.\nIn 2023, our existing franchise partners opened three domestic Texas Roadhouse restaurants and ten international\nTexas Roadhouse restaurants. Additionally, our first two domestic Jaggers franchise restaurants opened in 2023.\nFood and Beverage Costs\nFood and beverage costs, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, remained flat at 34.6% in both periods\npresented as the benefit of a higher guest check was offset by commodity inflation. Commodity inflation was 5.6% in\n2023 primarily due to higher beef costs.\nFor 2024, we currently expect commodity cost inflation of approximately 5% for the year with prices locked for\napproximately 40% of our forecasted costs and the remainder subject to floating market prices.\nRestaurant Labor Expenses\nRestaurant labor expense, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 33.4% in 2023 compared to\n33.1% in 2022. This increase was primarily due to wage and other labor inflation of 6.6% in 2023. Wage and other\nlabor inflation was primarily due to higher wage and benefit expense driven by labor market pressures along with\nincreases in state-mandated minimum and tipped wage rates and increased investment in our people. In addition, there\nwas an increase in group insurance expense due to unfavorable claims experience of $7.6 million, as compared to the\nprior year period. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in workers’ compensation expense due to favorable\nclaims experience of $2.5 million, as compared to the prior year period, as well as the benefit of a higher guest check.\nIn 2024, we anticipate our labor costs will continue to be pressured by wage and other labor inflation of 4% to 5%\ndriven by labor market pressures, increases in state-mandated minimum and tipped wages and increased investment in\nour people.\n44\nRestaurant Rent Expense\nRestaurant rent expense, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased to 1.6% in 2023 compared to 1.7%\nin 2022. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in average unit volume and was partially offset by higher rent\nexpense, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, at our newer restaurants.\nRestaurant Other Operating Expenses\nRestaurant other operating expenses, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 15.0% in 2023\ncompared to 14.9% in 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher general liability insurance expense partially offset\nby an increase in average unit volume and lower supplies expense. The increase in general liability insurance expense in\n2023 was due to unfavorable claims experience and increased retention levels which resulted in additional expense of\n$9.8 million as compared to 2022 which included a benefit of $4.9 million.\nRestaurant Pre-opening Expenses\nPre-opening expenses were $29.2 million in 2023 compared to $21.9 million in 2022 driven by an increase in the\nnumber and timing of new restaurant openings. Pre-opening costs will fluctuate from period to period based on the\nspecific pre-opening costs incurred for each restaurant, the number and timing of restaurant openings and the number\nand timing of restaurant managers hired.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses\nDepreciation and amortization expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 3.3% in 2023 compared to 3.4%\nin 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the increase in average unit volume partially offset by higher depreciation\nexpense at our newer restaurants.\nImpairment and Closure Costs, Net\nImpairment and closure costs, net were $0.3 million and $1.6 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023,\nimpairment and closure costs, net primarily related to ongoing closure costs of relocated stores. In 2022, impairment and\nclosure costs, net included $1.7 million related to the impairment of land, building and operating lease right-of-use assets\nat three restaurants, two of which relocated and $0.6 million related to ongoing closure costs. This was partially offset\nby a $0.7 million gain on the sale of land and building that was previously classified as assets held for sale.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, remained flat at 4.3% in both periods\npresented. A separation payout, net of restricted stock forfeitures, of $2.6 million related to the retirement of an\nexecutive officer in the first quarter of 2023, and increased software hosting fees were offset by an increase in average\nunit volume.\nInterest Income (Expense), Net\nInterest income (expense), net was $3.0 million in 2023 compared to $(0.1) million in 2022. The increase was\nprimarily driven by increased earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and decreased borrowings on our credit facility.\nEquity Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates\nEquity income was $1.4 million in 2023 compared to $1.2 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to a\n$0.6 million gain on the acquisition of four of these affiliates in 2023 as compared to a $0.3 million gain on the\nacquisition of one of these affiliates in 2022.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective tax rate decreased to 12.5% in 2023 compared to 13.6% in 2022. The decrease was primarily due to\nan increase in the FICA tip tax credit and an increase in excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. For\n2024, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 14% based on forecasted operating results.\n45\nSegment Information\nWe manage our restaurant and franchising operations by concept and as a result have identified Texas Roadhouse,\nBubba’s 33, Jaggers and our retail initiatives as separate operating segments. Our reportable segments are Texas\nRoadhouse and Bubba’s 33. The Texas Roadhouse reportable segment includes the results of our domestic company\nTexas Roadhouse restaurants and domestic and international franchise Texas Roadhouse restaurants. The Bubba’s 33\nreportable segment includes the results of our domestic company Bubba’s 33 restaurants. Our remaining operating\nsegments, which include the results of our domestic company and franchise Jaggers restaurants and the results of our\nretail initiatives, are included in Other.\nManagement uses restaurant margin as the primary measure for assessing performance of our segments. Restaurant\nmargin (in dollars and as a percentage of restaurant and other sales) represents restaurant and other sales less\nrestaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage costs, labor, rent and other operating costs. Restaurant\nmargin also includes sales and operating costs related to our non-royalty based retail initiatives that is included in Other.\nRestaurant margin is used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate restaurant-level operating efficiency and\nperformance. A reconciliation of income from operations to restaurant margin is included in the Results of Operations\nsection above.\nThe following table presents a summary of restaurant margin by segment (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 26, 2023 December 27, 2022\nTexas Roadhouse .................................... $ 671,158 15.5 % $ 600,197 16.0 %\nBubba’s 33 ......................................... 33,942 13.7 26,934 12.7\nOther .............................................. 2,864 11.2 370 2.6\nTotal .............................................. $ 707,964 15.4 % $ 627,501 15.7 %\nIn our Texas Roadhouse reportable segment, restaurant margin dollars increased $71.0 million or 11.8% in 2023.\nThe increase was primarily due to higher sales which were partially offset by commodity and wage and other labor\ninflation. In addition, restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, decreased to 15.5% in 2023 from\n16.0% in 2022. Restaurant margin was negatively impacted by commodity inflation, driven by beef, and wage and other\nlabor inflation which was partially offset by the benefit of higher sales.\nIn our Bubba’s 33 reportable segment, restaurant margin dollars increased $7.0 million or 26.0% in 2023. In\naddition, restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 13.7% in 2023 from 12.7% in\n2022. These increases were primarily due to higher sales and commodity deflation, driven by poultry, partially offset by\nwage and other labor inflation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents a summary of our net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing\nactivities (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\n2023 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities ...................... $ 564,984 $ 511,725\nNet cash used in investing activities .......................... (367,167) (263,734)\nNet cash used in financing activities .......................... (267,432) (409,775)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents ..................... $ (69,615) $ (161,784)\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $565.0 million in 2023 compared to $511.7 million in 2022. This\nincrease was due to an increase in net income, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a favorable\nchange in working capital.\nOur operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been\nable to operate with negative working capital, if necessary. Sales are primarily for cash, and restaurant operations do not\nrequire significant inventories or receivables. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages\nand supplies, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth.\n46\nNet cash used in investing activities was $367.2 million in 2023 compared to $263.7 million in 2022. The increase\nwas primarily due to higher capital expenditures, driven by the new company restaurants pipeline and the refurbishment\nof existing restaurants. The increase in the new company restaurants pipeline is primarily due to an increase in new\nlocations currently under construction and higher average development costs per location. The increase in the\nrefurbishment of existing restaurants is primarily due to increased maintenance needs driven by the high sales volumes at\nour restaurants.\nWe require capital principally for the development of new company restaurants, the refurbishment or relocation of\nexisting restaurants and the acquisition of franchise restaurants, if any. We either lease our restaurant site locations\nunder operating leases for periods generally of five to 30 years (including renewal periods) or purchase the land when\nappropriate. As of December 26, 2023, 155 of the 635 company restaurants have been developed on land which we\nown.\nThe following table presents a summary of capital expenditures (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\n2023 2022\nNew company restaurants .................................................... $ 201,234 $ 139,210\nRefurbishment or expansion of existing restaurants ............................... 119,785 84,414\nRelocation of existing restaurants ............................................. 20,629 18,478\nCapital expenditures related to Support Center office ............................. 5,386 4,019\nTotal capital expenditures .................................................... $ 347,034 $ 246,121\nOur future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number and mix of new restaurants we open, the\ntiming of those openings and the restaurant prototype developed in a given fiscal year. These requirements will include\ncosts directly related to new restaurants or relocating existing restaurants and may also include costs necessary to ensure\nthat our infrastructure is able to support a larger restaurant base.\nWe intend to satisfy our capital requirements over the next 12 months with cash on hand, net cash provided by\noperating activities, and if needed, funds available under our revolving credit facility. In 2024, we expect our capital\nexpenditures to be $340 million to $350 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $267.4 million in 2023 compared to $409.8 million in 2022. The decrease\nis primarily due to a decrease in the amount of share repurchases partially offset by an increase in our quarterly dividend\npayments.\nOn March 17, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to\n$300.0 million of our common stock. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. All repurchases to date\nunder our stock repurchase programs have been made through open market transactions.\nIn 2023, we paid $50.0 million to repurchase 455,026 shares of our common stock. In 2022, we paid $212.9\nmillion to repurchase 2,734,005 shares of our common stock. As of December 26, 2023, $116.9 million remained under\nour authorized stock repurchase program.\nOn February 14, 2023, our Board authorized the payment of a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common\nstock compared to the quarterly dividend of $0.46 per share of common stock declared in 2022. The payment of\nquarterly dividends totaled $147.2 million and $124.1 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. On February 14, 2024,\nour Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.61 per share of common stock.\nWe paid distributions of $8.0 million and $7.8 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, to equity holders of our\nmajority-owned company restaurants.\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility (the “credit facility”) with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, N.A. The credit facility is an unsecured, revolving credit agreement and\nhas a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million with the option to increase by an additional $200.0 million subject to\ncertain limitations, including approval by the syndicate of lenders. The credit facility has a maturity date of May 1,\n2026.\n47\nAs of December 26, 2023, we had no outstanding balance on the credit facility and had $295.3 million of\navailability, net of $4.7 million of outstanding letters of credit. As of December 27, 2022, we had $50.0 million\noutstanding on the credit facility, which was repaid in 2023, and $233.5 million of availability, net of $16.5 million of\noutstanding letters of credit. The outstanding amount as of December 27, 2022 is included as long-term debt on our\nconsolidated balance sheet.\nThe interest rate for the credit facility as of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022 was 6.23% and 5.21%,\nrespectively.\nThe lenders’ obligation to extend credit pursuant to the credit facility depends on us maintaining certain financial\ncovenants, including a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe credit facility permits us to incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness, except for the incurrence of secured\nindebtedness that in the aggregate is equal to or greater than $125.0 million and 20% of our consolidated tangible net\nworth. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of December 26, 2023.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the amount of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of\nDecember 26, 2023 (in thousands):\nPay me n ts Due by Pe ri od\nLess than More than\nTotal 1 year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years 5 years\nObligations under finance leases .............. 2,758 9 42 78 2,629\nInterest(1) ................................. 4,207 314 622 608 2,664\nReal estate operating lease obligations ......... 1,332,486 73,511 144,658 146,018 968,299\nCapital obligations.......................... 237,425 237,425 — — —\nTotal contractual obligations(2) ............... $ 1,576,876 $ 311,259 $ 145,322 $ 146,704 $ 973,592\n(1) Includes interest on our financing leases and assumes a constant interest rate until maturity.\n(2) Unrecognized tax benefits under Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, are not significant and\nexcluded from this amount.\nWe have no material minimum purchase commitments with our vendors that extend beyond a year. Refer to\nNotes 5, 8 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of contractual obligations.\nGuarantees\nAs of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, we were contingently liable for $10.4 million and $11.3 million,\nrespectively, for seven lease guarantees. These amounts represent the maximum potential liability of future payments\nunder the guarantees. In the event of default, the indemnity and default clauses in our assignment agreements govern our\nability to pursue and recover damages incurred. No material liabilities have been recorded as of December 26, 2023 or\nDecember 27, 2022, as the likelihood of default was deemed to be less than probable and the fair value of the guarantees\nis not considered significant.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our\nconsolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these\nfinancial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\nrevenue and expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our significant accounting policies are\ndescribed in Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that\nwe believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest\namount of subjective or complex judgments by management. Judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of\nthese policies may result in significantly different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different\nassumptions. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved\nin preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n48\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets. We evaluate long-lived assets related to each restaurant to be held and used in the\nbusiness, such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets subject to\namortization, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may\nnot be recoverable. For the purposes of this evaluation, we define the asset group at the individual restaurant level.\nWhen we evaluate the restaurants, cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment. Recoverability of assets to be\nheld and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant to estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows expected to be generated by the restaurant.\nUnder our policies, trailing 12-month cash flow results under a predetermined amount at the individual restaurant\nlevel signals a potential impairment. In our evaluation of restaurants that do not meet the cash flow threshold, we\nestimate future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over the remaining useful life of the primary asset,\nwhich is the building or the operating lease right-of-use asset. In the estimation of future cash flows, we consider the\nperiod of time the restaurant has been open, the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations\nfor future sales growth. We limit assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales\ngrowth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants.\nBoth qualitative and quantitative information are considered when evaluating for potential impairments. As we assess\nthe ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, these factors could cause us to realize a\nmaterial impairment charge. Based on our reviews performed on the cash flows of our restaurants, the carrying amount\nassociated with restaurants deemed at risk for impairment is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIf assets are determined to be impaired, we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the\nasset carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. The determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant\njudgment. We generally measure estimated fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows. When fair value is\nmeasured by discounting estimated future cash flows, the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe\nhypothetical market participants would use. We also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in\nthe projected cash flows. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges\nfor these assets.\nIn 2023, we recorded impairment and closure costs, net of $0.3 million related to ongoing closure costs of relocated\nstores. Refer to Note 17 in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding impairment and closure\ncosts recorded in 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested more frequently if events and circumstances\nindicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount\nexceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, up to the amount of goodwill recorded. Goodwill is required to be tested for\nimpairment at the reporting unit level, or the level of internal reporting that reflects the way in which an entity manages\nits businesses. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. Our\nreporting units are at the concept level. An entity may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The entity may also elect to\nbypass the qualitative assessment and determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying\namount. The fair value of the reporting unit may be based on several valuation approaches including capitalization of\nearnings, discounted cash flows, comparable public company market multiples and comparable acquisition market\nmultiples. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any\nexcess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nAt December 26, 2023, our Texas Roadhouse reporting unit had allocated goodwill of $169.7 million. No other\nreporting units had goodwill balances.\nIn performing the qualitative assessment, we reviewed factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and\nmarket considerations, cost factors, changes in management or key personnel, sustained decreases in share price and the\noverall financial performance of the Company’s Texas Roadhouse reporting unit. As a result of the qualitative\nassessment, no indicators of impairment were identified, and no additional indicators of impairment were identified\nthrough the end of the fourth quarter that would require additional testing. Changes in circumstances existing at the\nmeasurement date or at other times in the future could result in an impairment loss.\nEffects of Inflation\nDuring recent years, we have operated during periods of high inflation, led primarily by commodity cost and wage\n49\nand other labor inflation. Commodity cost inflation is due to increased costs incurred by our vendors related to increased\nlabor, transportation, packaging, and raw materials costs. Wage and other labor inflation is driven by higher wage and\nbenefit expense due to labor market pressures along with increases in state-mandated minimum and tipped wage rates\nand increased investment in our people. Some of the impacts of inflation have been offset by menu price increases and\nother adjustments made during the year. Whether we are able and/or choose to continue to offset the effects of inflation\nwill determine to what extent, if any, inflation affects our restaurant profitability in future periods.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on variable rate debt and changes in commodity\nprices. Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt. The terms of the credit facility\nrequire us to pay interest on outstanding borrowings at SOFR, plus a fixed adjustment of 0.10%, plus a variable\nadjustment of 0.875% to 1.875% depending on our leverage ratio. As of December 26, 2023, we had no outstanding\nborrowings on our credit facility.\nIn an effort to secure high quality, low-cost ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants, we employ\nvarious purchasing and pricing contract techniques. When purchasing certain types of commodities, we may be subject\nto prevailing market conditions resulting in unpredictable price volatility. For certain commodities, we may also enter\ninto contracts for terms of one year or less that are either fixed price agreements or fixed volume agreements where the\nprice is negotiated with reference to fluctuating market prices. We currently do not use financial instruments to hedge\ncommodity prices, but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness. Extreme and/or long-term increases in\ncommodity prices could adversely affect our future results, especially if we are unable, primarily due to competitive\nreasons, to increase menu prices. Additionally, if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our\nability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not\nto pass on the cost increases, our short-term financial results could be negatively affected.\nWe are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon four vendors. If these vendors are\nunable to fulfill their obligations under their contracts, we may encounter supply shortages and/or higher costs to secure\nadequate supply and a possible loss of sales, any of which would harm our business.\nITEM 8.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\n50\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nWe have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant\nto, and as defined in, Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the\nend of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, performed under the supervision and with the\nparticipation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (the\n“CFO”), our management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of December 26, 2023.\nChanges in internal control\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter\nended December 26, 2023 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our management is required to assess the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over\nfinancial reporting. As defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a process\ndesigned by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our\nBoard of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. Therefore, internal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can\nprovide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all\nmisstatements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we assessed the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this\nreport. In this assessment, the Company applied criteria based on the “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)”\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. These criteria are in the areas of\ncontrol environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring. The\nCompany’s assessment included documenting, evaluating and testing the design and operating effectiveness of its\ninternal control over financial reporting. Based upon this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 26, 2023.\nKPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in the Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 26, 2023 as stated in their report at F-3.\n51\nITEM 9B.

Zarley\n57\n(This page has been left blank intentionally.)\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Roadhouse, Inc. and subsidiaries (the\nCompany) as of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income and\ncomprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended\nDecember 26, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of\nDecember 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in\nthe three-year period ended December 26, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the\neffectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material\nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates\nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical\naudit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it\nrelates.\nPotential indicators of impairment of long-lived assets\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company assesses long-lived assets, primarily\nrelated to restaurants held and used in the business, including property and equipment and right-of-use assets, for\npotential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant,\nor asset group, may not be recoverable. Trailing 12-month cash flows under predetermined amounts at the\nindividual restaurant level are the Company’s primary indicator that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be\nrecoverable. Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, and the operating lease right-of-use assets,\nnet as of December 26, 2023 were $1,474.7 million and $694.0 million, respectively.\nWe identified the assessment of the Company’s determination of potential indicators of impairment of long-lived\nassets as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgement was required to evaluate the events or circumstances\nF-1\nindicating the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable, including the determination of the cash\nflow thresholds and the utilization of trailing 12-month cash flows to identify a potential impairment trigger.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s long-lived asset\nimpairment process, including controls relating to determination and identification of potential indicators of\nimpairment. We evaluated the Company’s methodology of using trailing 12-month cash flow results under\npredetermined thresholds at the individual restaurant level as a potential indicator of impairment. Specifically, we\nevaluated the Company’s assessment of the factors considered, including the cash flows at the individual restaurant\nlevel and the cash flow thresholds used in the Company’s analysis. We tested that those restaurants with trailing\n12-month cash flows were evaluated for potential impairment triggers, and we compared trailing 12-month cash\nflows to historical financial data. We also assessed other events and circumstances that could have been indicative\nof a potential impairment trigger by reviewing management’s development reports and related meeting minutes and\nthe board of directors meeting minutes.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1998.\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 23, 2024\nF-2\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Texas Roadhouse, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 26, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all\nmaterial respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, the\nrelated consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of\nthe years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated\nfinancial statements), and our report dated February 23, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was\nmaintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing\nand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit\nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding\nthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies\nand procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the\nfinancial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become\nF-3\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 23, 2024\nF-4\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nDecember 26, 2023 December 27, 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents .............................................. $ 104,246 $ 173,861\nReceivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $35 at December 26,\n2023 and $50 at December 27, 2022 .................................... 175,474 150,264\nInventories, net ....................................................... 38,320 38,015\nPrepaid income taxes .................................................. 3,262 5,097\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets ................................. 35,172 29,604\nTotal current assets ...................................................... 356,474 396,841\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation of $1,078,855 at\nDecember 26, 2023 and $968,036 at December 27, 2022 ...................... 1,474,722 1,270,349\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net ...................................... 694,014 630,258\nGoodwill .............................................................. 169,684 148,732\nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization of $20,929 at December 26,\n2023 and $17,905 at December 27, 2022 ................................... 3,483 5,607\nOther assets ............................................................ 94,999 73,878\nTotal assets ............................................................. $ 2,793,376 $ 2,525,665\nLiabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities ............................... $ 27,411 $ 25,490\nAccounts payable ..................................................... 131,638 105,560\nDeferred revenue-gift cards ............................................. 373,913 335,403\nAccrued wages ....................................................... 68,062 54,544\nIncome taxes payable .................................................. 112 434\nAccrued taxes and licenses ............................................. 42,758 35,264\nOther accrued liabilities ................................................ 101,540 95,315\nTotal current liabilities ................................................... 745,434 652,010\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current portion .............................. 743,476 677,874\nLong-term debt ......................................................... — 50,000\nRestricted stock and other deposits ......................................... 8,893 7,979\nDeferred tax liabilities, net ................................................ 23,104 20,979\nOther liabilities ......................................................... 114,958 89,161\nTotal liabilities .......................................................... 1,635,865 1,498,003\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and subsidiaries stockholders’ equity:\nPreferred stock ($0.001 par value, 1,000,000 shares authorized;

Our late founder, W. Kent Taylor, started the\nbusiness in 1993 with the opening of the first Texas Roadhouse restaurant in Clarksville, Indiana.\nThe Company maintains three restaurant concepts operating as Texas Roadhouse, Bubba’s 33 and Jaggers. As of\nDecember 26, 2023, we owned and operated 635 restaurants and franchised an additional 106 restaurants in 49 states and\nten foreign countries. Of the 106 franchise restaurants, there were 58 domestic and 48 international restaurants. As of\nDecember 27, 2022, we owned and operated 597 restaurants and franchised an additional 100 restaurants in 49 states and\nten foreign countries. Of the 100 franchise restaurants, 62 were domestic and 38 were international restaurants.\n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements present the financial position, results of operations and cash\nflows of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated in consolidation.\nAs of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, we owned a majority interest in 20 company restaurants. The\noperating results of these majority-owned restaurants are consolidated and the portion of income attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests is reflected in the line item net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our\nconsolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nAs of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, we owned a 5.0% to 10.0% equity interest in 20 and 23\ndomestic franchise restaurants, respectively. These unconsolidated restaurants are accounted for using the equity\nmethod. Our investments in these unconsolidated affiliates are included in other assets in our consolidated balance\nsheets, and we record our percentage share of net income earned by these unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated\nstatements of income and comprehensive income under equity income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated\naffiliates.\nFiscal Year\nWe utilize a 52 or 53 week accounting period that typically ends on the last Tuesday in December. We utilize a\n13 week accounting period for quarterly reporting purposes, except in years containing 53 weeks when the fourth quarter\ncontains 14 weeks. Fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were 52 weeks in length.\nUse of Estimates\nWe have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reporting of\nrevenue and expenses during the period to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions\ninclude the valuation of property and equipment, goodwill, lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, obligations related to\ninsurance reserves, legal reserves, income taxes and gift card breakage. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of a company that engage in business activities from which it may\nearn revenue and incur expenses, and for which separate financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by\nthe chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to assess the performance of the individual segments and make decisions\nabout resources to be allocated to the segments. The Company’s operating segments have been identified in accordance\nF-9\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nwith the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”)\nASC 280, Segment Reporting.\nWe have identified Texas Roadhouse, Bubba’s 33, Jaggers and our retail initiatives as separate operating segments.\nIn addition, we have identified Texas Roadhouse and Bubba’s 33 as reportable segments. For further discussion of\nsegment reporting, refer to Note 19.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash\nequivalents. Cash and cash equivalents also include receivables from credit card companies as these balances are highly\nliquid in nature and are settled within two to three business days. These amounted to $27.8 million and $22.0 million at\nDecember 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, respectively.\nReceivables\nReceivables consist principally of amounts due from retail gift card providers, certain franchise restaurants for\nreimbursement of labor costs, pre-opening and other expenses, and franchise restaurants for royalty fees.\nReceivables are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for doubtful accounts is\nour best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable. We determine the\nallowance based on historical collection experience, adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions and other\nfactors such as credit risk or industry trends, and the age of receivables. We review our allowance for doubtful accounts\nquarterly. Past due balances over 120 days are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged\noff against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered\nremote.\nInventories\nInventories, consisting principally of food, beverages and supplies, are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out)\nor net realizable value.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for major renewals and\nbetterments are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is\ncomputed on property and equipment, including assets located on leased properties, over the shorter of the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets or the underlying lease term using the straight-line method. In most cases, assets on\nleased properties are depreciated over a period of time which includes both the initial term of the lease and one or more\noption periods.\nThe estimated useful lives are:\nLand improvements ..................................................................... 10 - 25 years\nBuildings and leasehold improvements ..................................................... 10 - 25 years\nFurniture, fixtures and equipment ......................................................... 3 - 10 years\nThe cost of purchasing transferable liquor licenses through open markets in jurisdictions with a limited number of\nauthorized liquor licenses are capitalized as indefinite-lived assets and included in Property and equipment, net.\nF-10\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nThe Company capitalizes cloud computing implementation costs and amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis\nover the term of the related service agreement, including renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised.\nCapitalized cloud computing implementation costs were $3.0 million and $1.9 million, net of accumulated amortization,\nas of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, respectively. These costs are included in prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Related amortization expense was $1.4 million, $1.0\nmillion and $0.2 million for the years ended December 26, 2023, December 27, 2022, and December 28, 2021,\nrespectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income and\ncomprehensive income.\nLeases\nWe recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities for real estate leases, including our\nrestaurant leases and Support Center lease, as well as certain restaurant equipment leases based on the present value of\nthe lease payments over the lease term. We estimate the present value based on our incremental borrowing rate which\ncorresponds to the underlying lease term. In addition, operating lease right-of-use assets are reduced for accrued rent\nand increased for any initial direct costs recognized at lease inception. For real estate and restaurant equipment leases\ncommencing in 2019 and later, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Reductions\nof the right-of-use asset and the changes in the lease liability are included within the changes in operating lease right-of-\nuse assets and lease liabilities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCertain of our operating leases contain predetermined fixed escalations of the minimum rent over the lease term.\nFor these leases, we recognize the related total rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We may receive\nrent concessions or leasehold improvement incentives upon opening a restaurant that is subject to a lease which we\nconsider when determining straight-line rent expense. We also may receive rent holidays, which would begin on the\npossession date and end when the store opens, during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of\nthe lease. Rent holidays are included in the lease term when determining straight-line rent expense. In recognizing\nstraight-line rent expense, we record the difference between amounts charged to operations and amounts paid as accrued\nrent.\nCertain of our operating leases contain clauses that provide for additional contingent rent based on a percentage of\nsales greater than certain specified target amounts. We recognize contingent rent expense as variable rent expense prior\nto the achievement of the specified target that triggers the contingent rent, provided achievement of the target is\nconsidered probable. In addition, certain of our operating leases have variable escalations of the minimum rent that\ndepend on an index or rate. For these leases, we recognize operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease\nliabilities based on the index or rate at the commencement date. Any subsequent changes to the index or rate are\nrecognized as variable rent expense when the escalation is determinable.\nSale-leasebacks are transactions through which we sell previously acquired land at fair value and subsequently enter\ninto a lease agreement on the same land. The resulting lease agreement is evaluated to determine classification as an\noperating or finance lease and is recorded based on the lease classification. Refer to Note 8 for further discussion of\nleases.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired. In accordance with ASC\n350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”), goodwill is not subject to amortization and is evaluated for\nimpairment on an annual basis, or sooner if an event or other circumstance indicates that goodwill may be impaired. The\nannual assessment date is the first day of our fourth quarter.\nF-11\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nASC 350 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, or the level of internal reporting\nthat reflects the way in which an entity manages its businesses. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or\none level below an operating segment. Our goodwill reporting units are at the concept level.\nAs stated in ASC 350, an entity may first assess qualitative factors in order to determine if it is necessary to perform\nthe quantitative test. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for our annual review of\ngoodwill. This review included evaluating factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, cost factors, changes in management or key personnel, sustained decreases in share price and the overall\nfinancial performance of the Company’s reporting units at the concept level. As a result of the qualitative assessment,\nno indicators of impairment were identified, and no additional indicators of impairment were identified through the end\nof the fiscal year that would require additional testing.\nIn 2023, 2022 and 2021, we determined there was no goodwill impairment. Refer to Note 7 for additional\ninformation related to goodwill and intangible assets.\nOther Assets\nOther assets consist primarily of deferred compensation plan assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates and\ndeposits. For further discussion of the deferred compensation plan, refer to Note 15 and Note 16.\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant and Equipment, long-lived assets related to each restaurant to be held\nand used in the business, such as property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets\nsubject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the\ncarrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable. For the purposes of this evaluation, we define the asset group at\nthe individual restaurant level. When we evaluate the restaurants, cash flows are the primary indicator of impairment.\nRecoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant\nto estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the restaurant. Under our policies, trailing\n12-month cash flow results under a predetermined amount at the individual restaurant level signals potential impairment.\nIn our evaluation of restaurants that do not meet the cash flow threshold, we estimate future undiscounted cash flows\nfrom operating the restaurant over its remaining useful life, which can be for a period of over 20 years. In the estimation\nof future cash flows, we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open, the trend of operations over such\nperiod and future periods and expectations of future sales growth. Assumptions about important factors such as the trend\nof future operations and sales growth are limited to those that are supportable based upon the plans for the restaurant and\nactual results at comparable restaurants.\nIf the carrying amount of the restaurant exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge\nis recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. We generally\nmeasure fair value by discounting estimated future cash flows. When fair value is measured by discounting estimated\nfuture cash flows, the assumptions used are consistent with what we believe hypothetical market participants would use.\nWe also use a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk inherent in the projected cash flows. The adjusted\ncarrying amounts of assets to be held and used are depreciated over their remaining useful life. Refer to Note 17 for\nfurther discussion of amounts recorded as part of our impairment analysis.\nF-12\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nInsurance Reserves\nWe self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our health, workers’ compensation, general liability,\nemployment practices liability, and property insurance programs. We purchase insurance for individual claims that\nexceed the retention amounts listed below:\nDecember 26, 2023 December 27, 2022\nEmployment practices liability (“EPL”) ................................ $ 500,000 $ 500,000\nEPL Class Action .................................................. $ 2,500,000 $ 2,500,000\nWorkers’ compensation ............................................. $ 350,000 $ 350,000\nGeneral liability (1) ................................................. $ 2,500,000 $ 2,500,000\nProperty .......................................................... $ 250,000 $ 250,000\nEmployee healthcare ................................................ $ 400,000 $ 400,000\n(1) In addition to the retention amount of $2,500,000, we have an additional retention corridor that includes claim costs\nbetween $5,000,000 and $10,000,000 related to dram shop statutes.\nWe record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on\nhistorical experience. The estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic\nconditions, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices. Our\nassumptions are reviewed, monitored, and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an\nentity to allocate the transaction price received from customers to each separate and distinct performance obligation and\nrecognize revenue as these performance obligations are satisfied. We recognize revenue from company restaurant sales\nwhen food and beverage products are sold. Restaurant sales include gross food and beverage sales, net of promotions\nand discounts, for all company restaurants. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental\nauthorities are accounted for on a net basis and therefore are excluded from restaurant sales in the consolidated\nstatements of income and comprehensive income.\nWe record deferred revenue for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed. When the gift cards are\nredeemed, we recognize restaurant sales and reduce deferred revenue. For some of the gift cards that are sold we have\ndetermined that, based on our historic gift card redemption patterns, the likelihood of redemption is remote. For these\ngift cards, we record a breakage adjustment and reduce deferred revenue by the amount never expected to be redeemed.\nWe use historic gift card redemption patterns to determine the breakage rate to utilize and recognize the expected\nbreakage amount in a manner generally consistent with the actual redemption pattern of the associated gift card. We\nreview the breakage rate on an annual basis, or sooner if circumstances indicate that the rate may have significantly\nchanged and update the rate accordingly as needed. In addition, we incur fees on all gift cards that are sold through\nthird-party retailers. These fees are also deferred and generally recorded consistent with the actual redemption pattern of\nthe associated gift cards.\nWe also recognize revenue from our franchising of Texas Roadhouse and Jaggers restaurants. This includes\nfranchise royalties and domestic marketing and advertising fees, initial and upfront franchise fees, domestic and\ninternational development agreements and supervisory and administrative service fees. We recognize franchise royalties\nand domestic marketing and advertising fees as franchise restaurant sales occur. For initial and upfront franchise fees\nand fees from development agreements, because the services we provide related to these fees do not contain separate and\ndistinct performance obligations from the franchise right, these fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term\nof the associated franchise agreement. We recognize fees from supervision and administrative services as incurred.\nF-13\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, under which deferred assets and\nliabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial\nstatement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We recognize both interest and penalties\non unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. A valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying\nvalue of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Any change in\nthe valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. For all years\npresented, no valuation allowances have been recorded.\nAdvertising\nWe have a domestic system-wide marketing and advertising fund. We maintain control of the marketing and\nadvertising fund and, as such, have consolidated the fund’s activity for all the years presented. Domestic company and\nfranchise restaurants are required to remit a designated portion of sales to the advertising fund. Advertising\ncontributions related to company restaurants are recorded as a component of other operating costs. Advertising\ncontributions received from our franchisees are recorded as a component of franchise royalties and fees in our\nconsolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nOther costs related to local restaurant area marketing initiatives are included in other operating costs in our\nconsolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. These costs and the company restaurant contribution\namounted to $28.3 million, $25.0 million and $21.1 million for the years ended December 26, 2023, December 27, 2022,\nand December 28, 2021, respectively.\nPre-opening Expenses\nPre-opening expenses, which are charged to operations as incurred, consist of expenses incurred before the opening\nof a new or relocated restaurant and consist principally of opening team and training team compensation and benefits,\ntravel expenses, rent, food, beverage and other initial supplies and expenses.\nComprehensive Income\nASC 220, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income, establishes standards for reporting and the\npresentation of comprehensive income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive income\nconsists of net income and foreign currency translation adjustments which are excluded from net income under GAAP.\nForeign currency translation adjustment represents the unrealized impact of translating the financial statements of our\nforeign investment.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, establishes a\nframework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This includes a three-level\nhierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\nF-14\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\ninputs in measuring fair value. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an\nasset or liability on the measurement date.\nLevel 1 Inputs based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.\nLevel 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable\nfor the assets, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 Inputs that are unobservable for the asset.\nFair value measurements are separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 16 for\nfurther discussion of fair value measurement.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic\n848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides temporary optional\nexpedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting. These changes are\nintended to simplify the market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank\noffered rates to alternative reference rates. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform\n(Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31,\n2022 to December 31, 2024. We adopted this guidance during the 2023 fiscal year and the adoption did not have an\nimpact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosure. This ASU primarily provides enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses including\nrequiring segment disclosures to include a description of other segment items by reportable segment and any additional\nmeasures of a segment’s profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also\nrequires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods as well as the title of the\nCODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure of segment profit or loss in assessing\nperformance and allocating resources. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently\nassessing the impact of this new standard on our segment reporting disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax\nDisclosures. This ASU primarily provides enhanced disclosures about an entity’s income tax including requiring\nconsistent categories and greater disaggregation of the information included in the rate reconciliation and income taxes\npaid disaggregated by jurisdiction. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. We are currently\nassessing the impact of this new standard on our income tax disclosures.\n(3) Revenue\nThe following table disaggregates our revenue by major source:\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 26, 2023 December 27, 2022 December 28, 2021\nRestaurant and other sales ............................. $ 4,604,554 $ 3,988,791 $ 3,439,176\nFranchise royalties.................................... 24,169 23,058 21,770\nFranchise fees ....................................... 2,949 3,070 3,000\nTotal revenue ........................................ $ 4,631,672 $ 4,014,919 $ 3,463,946\nF-15\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nThe following table presents a rollforward of deferred revenue-gift cards:\nFiscal Year Ended\nDecember 26, 2023 December 27, 2022\nBeginning balance .................................................... $ 335,403 $ 300,657\nGift card activations, net of third-party fees ............................... 420,047 366,606\nGift card redemptions and breakage .....................................

We recognized restaurant sales of $190.5 million for the year ended\nDecember 27, 2022 related to amounts in deferred revenue as of December 28, 2021.\n(4) Acquisitions\nOn December 28, 2022, the first day of the 2023 fiscal year, we completed the acquisition of eight franchise Texas\nRoadhouse restaurants located in Maryland and Delaware, including four in which we previously held a 5.0% equity\ninterest. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreements, we paid a total purchase price of $39.1 million, net of cash\nacquired, for 100% of the entities. The transactions in which we held an equity interest were accounted for as step\nacquisitions and we recorded a gain of $0.6 million on our previous investments in equity income from investments in\nunconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nThese transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method as defined in ASC 805, Business\nCombinations. These acquisitions are consistent with our long-term strategy to increase net income and earnings per\nshare.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid for these acquisitions and the estimated preliminary fair\nvalue of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, which are adjusted for measurement-\nperiod adjustments through December 26, 2023.\nInventory ........................................................... $ 410\nOther assets ......................................................... 293\nProperty and equipment ............................................... 17,763\nOperating lease right-of-use assets ...................................... 4,775\nGoodwill ........................................................... 20,067\nIntangible assets ..................................................... 1,700\nDeferred revenue-gift cards ............................................

Intangible assets\nrepresent reacquired franchise rights which are being amortized over a weighted-average useful life of 2.2 years. We\nexpect all of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes and believe the resulting amount of goodwill reflects the\nbenefit of sales and unit growth opportunities as well as the benefit of the assembled workforce of the acquired\nrestaurants.\nPro forma financial detail and operating results for the year ended December 26, 2023 have not been presented as\nthe results of the acquired restaurants are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows.\nF-16\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nOn March 30, 2022, we completed the acquisition of one franchise Texas Roadhouse restaurant located in Nebraska\nin which we previously held a 5.49% equity interest. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement, we paid a total\npurchase price of $6.6 million, net of cash acquired, for 100% of the entity. The transaction was accounted for as a step\nacquisition and we recorded a gain of $0.3 million on our previous investment in equity income from investments in\nunconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.\nOn December 29, 2021, the first day of the 2022 fiscal year, we completed the acquisition of seven franchise Texas\nRoadhouse restaurants located in South Carolina and Georgia. Pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreements, we\npaid a total purchase price of $26.5 million, net of cash acquired.\nThese acquisitions are consistent with our long-term strategy to increase net income and earnings per share. The\ntransactions were accounted for using the acquisition method as defined in ASC 805, Business Combinations.\nThe following table summarizes the consideration paid for these acquisitions and the estimated fair value of the\nassets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, which are adjusted for final measurement-period\nadjustments.\nInventory ........................................................... $ 321\nOther assets ......................................................... 222\nProperty and equipment ............................................... 4,841\nOperating lease right-of-use assets ...................................... 1,221\nGoodwill ........................................................... 22,616\nIntangible assets ..................................................... 6,100\nDeferred revenue-gift cards ............................................

We expect all of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes and believe the resulting amount of\ngoodwill reflects the benefit of sales and unit growth opportunities as well as the benefit of the assembled workforce of\nthe acquired restaurants.\nPro forma financial detail and operating results for the year ended December 27, 2022 have not been presented as\nthe results of the acquired restaurants are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows.\n(5) Long-term Debt\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility (the “credit facility”) with a syndicate of commercial lenders led by\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and PNC Bank, N.A. The credit facility is an unsecured, revolving credit agreement and\nhas a borrowing capacity of up to $300.0 million with the option to increase by an additional $200.0 million subject to\ncertain limitations, including approval by the syndicate of lenders. The credit facility has a maturity date of May 1,\n2026.\nOn May 19, 2023, we amended the credit facility to provide for the transition from LIBOR to the Secured\nOvernight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the benchmark rate for purposes of calculating interest on outstanding\nborrowings.

There were no shares of preferred stock outstanding at December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022.\n(11) Stock Repurchase Program\nOn March 17, 2022, our Board approved a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to $300.0\nmillion of our common stock. This stock repurchase program has no expiration date. All repurchases to date under our\nstock repurchase programs have been made through open market transactions. The timing and the amount of any\nrepurchases are determined by management under parameters established by the Board, based on an evaluation of our\nstock price, market conditions and other corporate considerations.\nFor the year ended December 26, 2023, we paid $50.0 million to repurchase 455,026 shares of our common stock.\nFor the year ended December 27, 2022, we paid $212.9 million to repurchase 2,734,005 shares of our common stock.\nThis included $133.1 million repurchased under our current authorized stock repurchase program and $79.7 million\nrepurchased under our prior authorization.

Performance stock units are not included in the diluted earnings per\nshare calculation until the performance-based criteria have been met. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of our\nequity incentive plans.\nFor all periods presented, the weighted-average shares of nonvested stock units that were outstanding but not\nincluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect were not\nsignificant.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of earnings per share and weighted average shares outstanding as\npresented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income:\nF is cal Year Ende d\nDecember 26, December 27, December 28,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet income attributable to Texas\nRoadhouse, Inc. and subsidiaries ........... $ 304,876 $ 269,818 $ 245,294\nBasic EPS:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding . 66,893 67,643 69,709\nBasic EPS ............................... $ 4.56 $ 3.99 $ 3.52\nDiluted EPS:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding . 66,893 67,643 69,709\nDilutive effect of nonvested stock units ....... 256 277 389\nShares-diluted ............................ 67,149 67,920 70,098\nDiluted EPS .............................. $ 4.54 $ 3.97 $ 3.50\nF-23\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\n(13) Commitments and Contingencies\nThe estimated cost of completing capital project commitments at December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022 was\n$237.4 million and $205.7 million, respectively.\nAs of December 26, 2023 and December 27, 2022, we are contingently liable for $10.4 million and $11.3 million,\nrespectively, for seven lease guarantees. These amounts represent the maximum potential liability of future payments\nunder the guarantees. In the event of default, the indemnity and default clauses in our assignment agreements govern our\nability to pursue and recover damages incurred. No liabilities have been recorded as of December 26, 2023 or\nDecember 27, 2022, as the likelihood of default was deemed to be less than probable and the fair value of the guarantees\nis not considered significant.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2023, we bought our beef primarily from four suppliers. Although there are a\nlimited number of beef suppliers, we believe that other suppliers could provide a similar product on comparable terms.\nWe have no material minimum purchase commitments with our vendors that extend beyond a year.\nOccasionally, we are a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including “slip and fall”\naccidents, employment related claims, dram shop statutes related to our service of alcohol, and claims from guests or\nemployees alleging illness, injury or food quality, health or operational concerns.

The Plan provides for the granting of various forms of equity awards including options, stock appreciation\nrights, full value awards, and performance-based awards.\nThe Company provides restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees as a form of share-based compensation. A\nRSU is the conditional right to receive one share of common stock upon satisfaction of the vesting requirement. In\naddition to RSUs, the Company provides performance stock units (“PSUs”) to certain members of management as a\nform of share-based compensation.

Share-based compensation\nexpense is recognized for the number of units expected to vest at the end of the period and is expensed beginning on the\ngrant date and through the performance period. For each grant, PSUs vest after meeting the performance and service\nconditions. The total intrinsic value of PSUs vested during the years ended December 26, 2023, December 27, 2022 and\nDecember 28, 2021 was $3.3 million, $5.4 million and $0.4 million, respectively.\nOn January 8, 2024, approximately 43,000 shares vested related to the January 2023 PSU grant and are expected to\nbe distributed during the 13 weeks ending March 26, 2024.

This resulted in a loss of $0.7 million\nfor the fiscal year ended December 27, 2022, which is included in impairment and closure, net in our consolidated\nstatements of income and comprehensive income.\n(17) Impairment and Closure Costs\nWe recorded impairment and closure costs of $0.3 million, $1.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended\nDecember 26, 2023, December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021, respectively.\nImpairment and closure costs in 2023 included $0.3 million related to ongoing closure costs for stores which have\nrelocated.\nImpairment and closure costs in 2022 included $1.7 million related to the impairment of the land, building and\noperating lease right-of-use assets at three restaurants, two of which were relocated and $0.6 million related to ongoing\nclosure costs. This was partially offset by a $0.7 million gain on the sale of land and building that was previously\nclassified as assets held for sale.\nImpairment and closure costs in 2021 included $0.7 million related to the impairment of the fixed assets and\noperating lease right-of-use assets at two restaurants, both of which have relocated.\n(18) Related Party Transactions\nAs of December 26, 2023, December 27, 2022 and December 28, 2021, we had four franchise restaurants and one\nmajority-owned company restaurant owned in part by a current officer of the Company. We recognized revenue of\n$2.0 million, $1.8 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 26, 2023, December 27, 2022, and\nDecember 28, 2021, respectively, related to these restaurants.\n(19) Segment Information\nWe manage our restaurant and franchising operations by concept and as a result have identified Texas Roadhouse,\nBubba’s 33, Jaggers and our retail initiatives as separate operating segments. Our reportable segments are Texas\nRoadhouse and Bubba’s 33. The Texas Roadhouse reportable segment includes the results of our domestic company\nTexas Roadhouse restaurants and domestic and international franchise Texas Roadhouse restaurants. The Bubba’s 33\nreportable segment includes the results of our domestic company Bubba’s 33 restaurants. Our remaining operating\nsegments, which include the results of our domestic company and franchise Jaggers restaurants and the results of our\nretail initiatives, are included in Other. In addition, Corporate-related segment assets, depreciation and amortization and\ncapital expenditures are also included in Other.\nManagement uses restaurant margin as the measure for assessing performance of our segments. Restaurant margin\nrepresents restaurant and other sales less restaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage costs, labor, rent\nand other operating costs. Restaurant margin also includes sales and operating costs related to our non-royalty based\nretail initiatives. Restaurant margin is used by our CODM to evaluate core restaurant-level operating efficiency and\nperformance.\nIn calculating restaurant margin, we exclude certain non-restaurant-level costs that support operations, including\npre-opening and general and administrative expenses, but do not have a direct impact on restaurant-level operational\nefficiency and performance. We exclude pre-opening expense as it occurs at irregular intervals and would impact\ncomparability to prior period results. We exclude depreciation and amortization expense, substantially all of which\nrelates to restaurant-level assets, as it represents a non-cash charge for the investment in our restaurants. We exclude\nimpairment and closure expense as we believe this provides a clearer perspective of the Company’s ongoing operating\nperformance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant margin as presented may not be\ncomparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry.\nF-27\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Tabular amounts in thousands, except share and per share data)\nRestaurant and other sales for all operating segments are derived primarily from food and beverage sales.

This is a credit to the\nhard work of our operators who create an environment where Roadies want to work and guests want to dine.”\nMorgan continued, “Looking ahead to 2025, we once again have a strong development pipeline and as of today already\nhave 10 of our new company restaurants under construction. We remain confident that this new store growth along with\nour planned franchise acquisition and overall capital allocation strategy will allow us to continue to generate long-term\nshareholder value.”\nFranchise Acquisition\nThe Company has tentatively agreed to acquire 13 domestic franchise restaurants with a targeted close date as of the\nbeginning of our 2025 fiscal year. These acquisitions are subject to the completion of customary negotiations and due\ndiligence.\n2024 Outlook\nComparable restaurant sales at company restaurants for the first four weeks of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2024\nincreased 8.3% compared to 2023. In addition, the Company implemented a menu price increase of approximately 0.9%\nin late September.\nManagement updated the following expectations for 2024:\n• Commodity cost inflation of less than 1%;\n• Wage and other labor inflation of approximately 4.5%; and\n• An effective income tax rate of approximately 15%.\nManagement reiterated the following expectations for 2024:\n• Positive comparable restaurant sales growth including the benefit of menu pricing actions;\n• Store week growth of approximately 7.5%, including a benefit of 2% from the 53rd week; and\n• Total capital expenditures of $360 million to $370 million.\n2025 Outlook\nManagement provided the following initial expectations for 2025:\n• Positive comparable restaurant sales growth including the benefit of 2024 menu pricing actions;\n• Store week growth of approximately 5%, including a benefit of 2% from the planned franchise acquisition;\n• Commodity cost inflation of 2% to 3%;\n• Wage and other labor inflation of 4% to 5%;\n• An effective income tax rate of 15% to 16%; and\n• Total capital expenditures of approximately $400 million.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples (“GAAP”). Within the press release, the Company makes reference to restaurant margin (in dollars, as\na percentage of restaurant and other sales, and per store week). Restaurant margin represents restaurant and other sales\nless restaurant-level operating costs, including food and beverage costs, labor, rent, and other operating costs. Restaurant\nmargin should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative, to income from operations. This non-GAAP measure is\nnot indicative of overall company performance and profitability in that this measure does not accrue directly to the benefit\nof shareholders due to the nature of the costs excluded. Restaurant margin is widely regarded as a useful metric by which\nto evaluate core restaurant-level operating efficiency and performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nIn calculating restaurant margin, the Company excludes certain non-restaurant-level costs that support operations, but do\nnot have a direct impact on restaurant-level operational efficiency and performance, including general and administrative\nexpenses. The Company excludes pre-opening expenses as they occur at irregular intervals and would impact\ncomparability to prior period results. The Company excludes depreciation and amortization expenses, substantially all of\nwhich relate to restaurant-level assets, as they represent a non-cash charge for the investment in restaurants. The Company\nexcludes impairment and closure expenses as it believes this provides a clearer perspective of ongoing operating\nperformance and a more useful comparison to prior period results. Restaurant margin as presented may not be comparable\nto other similarly titled measures of other companies in the industry. A reconciliation of income from operations to\nrestaurant margin is included in the accompanying financial tables.\nConference Call\nTexas Roadhouse, Inc. is hosting a conference call today, October 24, 2024, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss these\nresults.
