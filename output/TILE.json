(NASDAQ: TILE), the global flooring solutions company and leader in sustainability, announced that Newsweek named it one of America’s Greenest Companies of 2025. The recognition highlights the top U.S.- headquartered businesses dedicated to reducing their impact on the planet. Interface distinguished itself as a leader in sustainability, earning this achievement through its 30- year history of environmental achievements, ambitious climate targets, and commitment to becoming carbon negative by 2040.\n\nAs the only flooring company on the list, Interface reinforces its position as the industry’s definitive sustainability leader. The manufacturer recently announced its decision to focus on direct carbon reduction and carbon storage, rather than offsets, to meet the urgency of the climate crisis. In its pursuit of absolute carbon reduction, Interface continues to invest in innovation and R&D projects that avoid, reduce, and store more carbon across its entire enterprise. Another key element of the company’s carbon plan is to inspire others – within and beyond the flooring industry – creating a ripple effect that accelerates collective action and positive impacts.\n\n“We’re energized by continued recognition of our sustainability leadership, particularly our bold decision to accelerate our carbon reduction and carbon storage efforts, without the use of carbon offsets,” said Laurel Hurd, CEO of Interface. “This acknowledgment by Newsweek reinforces that we are taking the necessary steps to reduce our impact and go ‘all in’ on becoming carbon negative. While there is more work ahead, we want to inspire others to set their own ambitious sustainability goals and take decisive action to lower carbon impacts across their products, operations, and supply chains.”\n\nThe awards program, part of Newsweek's annual ranking in collaboration with Plant-A Insights and GIST Impact, is in its second year. Eligible companies must meet the European Union's sustainability standards, evaluating Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues such as biodiversity, climate change, and human rights.\n\nFor more information about the Newsweek America's Greenest Companies 2025 ranking, click [here](https://www.newsweek.com/rankings/americas-greenest-companies-2025).\n\n**About Interface**\n\nInterface, Inc., (NASDAQ: TILE) is a global flooring solutions company and sustainability leader, offering an integrated portfolio of carpet tile and resilient flooring products that includes Interface® carpet tile and LVT, nora® rubber flooring, and FLOR® premium area rugs for commercial and residential spaces.

This nora by Interface introduction combines an inspiring and versatile color palette with the durability and functionality needed to perform in very high-traffic spaces. \n\nDesigners and flooring specifiers can choose from 22 colors ranging from elegant neutrals to vibrant accents. norament 926 satura is offered in the timeless hammered surface or the new subtly structured two-tone design, allowing for rich, saturated interplays of color and texture. Both surfaces are exceptionally durable, maintaining their appearance even under the most demanding conditions in education, public buildings, healthcare, and workplace applications. \n\n“norament 926 satura is one of our best-selling products because of its unique design concept and performance offering,” said Kelly Simcox, Head of Global Design “We crafted this refreshed collection with a focus on design, introducing new colors and versatile options that empower architects and designers to create dynamic spaces tailored to the unique needs of end users.

It is offered in 22 striking hues with the classic hammerblow surface, six of which are also available in an elegant, subtly structured two-tone surface. Both the colors and surface can be seamlessly combined, allowing for a wide range of design concepts to be brought to life. \n\nThe collection’s same-colored granules, perfectly matched to the base color of the flooring, make for a seamless and consistent look across the floorscape, perfect for filling an entire room for maximum impact. Or, with the use of inlays, it can help delineate work areas, define room boundaries, and enhance wayfinding. \n\n**Focus on performance and sustainability**\n\nDesigned for very high-traffic areas, norament 926 satura stands out for its superior performance benefits.

BUSINESS\nGeneral\nReferences in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Interface,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to\nInterface, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them, unless the context requires otherwise.\nInterface is a global flooring company specializing in carbon neutral carpet tile and resilient flooring, including luxury vinyl\ntile (“LVT”), and nora® rubber flooring. We help our customers create high-performance interior spaces that support well-being,\nproductivity, and creativity, as well as sustainability of the planet.\nAs a global company with a reputation for high quality, reliability and premium positioning, we market modular carpet under\nthe established brand names Interface® and FLOR®, and we market LVT under the brand Interface®. In 2018, the Company\nacquired nora Holding GmbH (“nora”), a worldwide leader in the rubber flooring category under the established nora brands\nnoraplan® and norament®.\nReportable Segments\nThe Company has two operating and reportable segments – namely Americas (“AMS”) and Europe, Africa, Asia and\nAustralia (collectively “EAAA”). The AMS operating segment includes the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic\nareas. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nBelow is a summary of total net sales percentages by reportable segment for the last three fiscal years.\n2023 2022 2021\nAMS ................................................................................ 58% 58% 54%\nEAAA .............................................................................. 42% 42% 46%\nMarket Segmentation\nOur business, as well as the commercial interiors industry in general, is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic\nconditions and trends that affect the markets for commercial and institutional business space. We believe the appeal and utilization\nof modular carpet and resilient flooring will continue to grow in corporate office and non-corporate office market segments, and\nwe are using our considerable skills and experience with designing, producing and marketing modular products that make us a\nmarket leader in the corporate office market segment to support and facilitate our penetration into more non-corporate office\nmarket segments around the world.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the continued disruption in our economic markets due to ongoing inflation, increases in interest\nrates, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, a fairly stabilized but challenging supply chain environment,\na slow post COVID recovery in China and slow market conditions in the rest of Asia, and significant financial pressures in the\ncommercial office market globally, all posed challenges for us.\n3\nBelow is a summary of our sales mix between corporate office and non-corporate office market segments for the last three\nfiscal years by reportable segment:\n2023 2022 2021\nCorporate Non-Corporate Corporate Non-Corporate Corporate Non-Corporate\nOffice Office Office Office Office Office\nAMS ............... 40% 60% 38% 62% 39% 61%\nEAAA ............. 61% 39% 61% 39% 57% 43%\nProducts and Services\nModular Carpet\nOur AMS and EAAA reportable segments sell the same products within their respective geographical regions. We produce\ncarpet tiles in a wide variety of colors, patterns, textures, pile heights and densities. These varieties are designed to meet both the\npractical and aesthetic needs of a broad spectrum of commercial interiors — particularly offices, healthcare facilities, airports,\neducational and other institutions, hospitality spaces, retail facilities — and residential interiors. Our carpet tile systems permit\ndistinctive styling and patterning that can be used to complement interior designs, to set off areas for particular purposes and\ncreate visual cues. While we continue to manufacture and sell a substantial portion of our carpet tile in standard styles, most of\nour modular carpet sales in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions are made-to-order products designed to meet customer\nspecifications.\nOur modular carpet systems are marketed under the established brands Interface and FLOR. We manufacture carpet tiles cut\nin precise, dimensionally stable squares (usually 50 cm x 50 cm) or rectangles (such as planks and Skinny Planks™). Our\nGlasBac® technology employs a fiberglass-reinforced polymeric composite backing that provides dimensional stability and\nreduces the need for adhesives or fasteners. We also make carpet tiles with a backing containing post-industrial and/or post-\nconsumer recycled materials, which we now market under the CQuest™GB name (formerly known as GlasBacRE). In addition,\nwe make carpet tile with yarn containing varying degrees of recycled post-consumer nylon, depending on the style and color.\nIn 2021, we introduced our Open Air™ collection of more affordable carpet tiles — an expansive platform of hard-working\ncarpet tile styles designed with open spaces in mind. Innovations in both design and manufacturing allow us to create these high-\nquality, high-performance carpet products at a lower price point.\nLaunched in 2020, our next generation of carpet tile backings are called CQuest™ backings. Guided by materials science\nand inspired by nature’s carbon-storing abilities, we added new bio-based materials and more recycled content to our backings.\nThe materials in the CQuest backings, when measured on a stand-alone basis, are net carbon negative — meaning that their global\nwarming potential emissions are net negative. The CQuest backings are:\n• CQuest™GB – The next evolution of our GlasBacRE backing. It features the same superior performance with a\nconstruction of post-consumer recycled content from carpet tiles, bio-based additives, and pre-consumer recycled\nmaterials.\n• CQuest™Bio – A non-vinyl bio-composite backing made with bio-based and recycled fillers.\n• CQuest™BioX – The same material make-up as CQuestBio with a higher concentration of carbon negative materials.\nOur i2™ modular product line, which includes our popular Entropy® product, features mergeable dye lots, and includes a\nnumber of carpet tile products that are designed to be installed randomly without reference to the orientation of neighboring tiles.\nThe i2 line offers cost-efficient installation and maintenance, interactive flexibility, and recycled and recyclable materials. Our\nTacTiles® carpet tile installation system uses small squares of adhesive plastic film to connect intersecting carpet tiles, thus\neliminating the need for traditional carpet adhesive and resulting in a reduction in installation time and material waste.\nWe also produce and sell a specially adapted version of our carpet tile for the healthcare facilities market. Our carpet tile\npossesses characteristics — such as the use of the Intersept® antimicrobial, static-controlling nylon yarns, and thermally\npigmented, colorfast yarns — which make it suitable for use in these facilities in place of hard surface flooring. Moreover, we\nsell our FLOR line of products to specifically target modular carpet sales to the residential market segment, and in recent years\nFLOR products have had crossover success in commercial markets. In addition, we have created modular carpet products\nspecifically designed for each of the education, hospitality and retail market segments.\n4\nThe award-winning design firm David Oakey Designs has had a pivotal role in developing many of our innovative product\ndesigns. David Oakey Designs has developed products that are manufactured using state-of-the-art tufting technology, which\nallows us to pinpoint tufts of different colored yarns in virtually any arrangement within a carpet tile. These unique designs are\nbest exemplified by our Urban Retreat®, Net Effect®, Human Nature® and World Woven® collections, which are sold throughout\nour international operations.\nIn 2020, we achieved a substantial milestone in our journey toward becoming a sustainable enterprise. Simultaneously with\nthe launch of our new CQuest backings described above, we introduced in the Americas and subsequently in our EAAA\ngeographical regions, our first ever “cradle-to-gate” carbon negative carpet tile products in three unique styles: Shishu Stitch™,\nTokyo Texture™, and Zen Stitch™. These pioneering products, which are part of our Embodied Beauty™ collection, are created\nwith a combination of our new CQuestBioX carpet backing (featuring new bio-based materials and more recycled content),\nspecialty yarns and tufting processes that create a carpet tile with a net negative value of “embodied carbon”. Embodied carbon\nis the carbon footprint (meaning the global warming potential of emissions of greenhouse gases measured in carbon dioxide\nequivalents) of a product from raw material creation, growth and extraction (the “cradle”) through processing until it is packaged\nand ready to be shipped from our factory (the “gate”), thus referred to as “cradle-to-gate” in the life cycle assessment of a product.\nEmbodied carbon is distinct from operational carbon, which refers to the carbon footprint of everything that happens after the\nproduct leaves our factory, such as shipment, customer use, and end of life.\nModular Resilient Flooring\nIn 2016, we began offering a category of products we call modular resilient flooring, and our first product introductions into\nthis category were LVT products in the United States. LVT shares many of the same attributes and benefits as carpet tile, but has\na resilient or hard surface instead of a soft surface of yarn. In 2017, we launched our LVT products globally, beginning with the\nLevel Set™ collection which is available in styles with printed top layers in a variety of aesthetic looks, including natural\nwoodgrains and stones, textured woodgrains, and patterns. Our LVT products are modular and come in sizes that match certain\nof our modular carpet tile squares and planks. Some of our LVT products are engineered to the same or similar height as our\nmodular carpet, which means our customers have the ability to install our LVT and modular carpet products side by side without\ntransition strips or layering. In addition, some of our LVT products include a backing system that provides acoustic insulation\nwithout the need for additional underlayment, which can reduce the impact of sound in the space where the flooring is used.\nRubber Flooring\nWith the acquisition of nora in 2018, we began offering rubber flooring products under the established noraplan and norament\nbrands, which enhances the Company’s resilient flooring portfolio. Rubber flooring is ideal for applications that require hygienic,\nsafe flooring with strong chemical resistance. Rubber flooring is extremely durable compared to other flooring alternatives.\nOther Products and Services\nWe sell a proprietary antimicrobial chemical compound under the registered trademark Intersept that we incorporate in some\nof our modular carpet products. We also sell our TacTiles carpet tile installation system, along with a variety of traditional\nadhesives and products for carpet installation and maintenance that are manufactured by a third party. We also continue to provide\n“turnkey” project management services for a number of global accounts and other large customers through our\nInterfaceSERVICES™ business.\n5\nManufacturing and Raw Materials\nWe manufacture carpet tile at two locations in the United States and at facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom,\nChina and Australia. We also manufactured carpet tile at a location in Thailand for many years, but in 2021 we announced the\nclosure of the Thailand plant, in which manufacturing was permanently halted at the end of the first quarter of 2022. The Thailand\nreal estate was sold in 2023. We manufacture rubber flooring in Germany.\nOur raw materials are generally available from multiple sources — both regionally and globally — with the exception of\nsynthetic fiber (nylon yarn). For yarn, we principally rely upon two major global suppliers, but we also have significant\nrelationships with at least two other suppliers. Although our number of principal yarn suppliers is limited, we do have the\ncapability to manufacture carpet using yarn produced from two separate polymer feedstocks — nylon 6 and nylon 6,6 — which\nprovides additional flexibility with respect to yarn supply inputs, if needed. Our global sourcing strategy, including with respect\nto our principal yarn suppliers and dual polymer manufacturing capability, allows us to help guard against any potential shortages\nof raw materials or raw material suppliers in a specific polymer supply chain. For rubber flooring, the key polymer raw materials\nare available from multiple sources, and we can source both synthetic and natural rubber depending on product specification and\nmaterial availability.\nWe also have technology that separates the face fiber and backing of reclaimed and waste carpet, thus making it easier to\nrecycle some of its components and providing a purer supply of inputs for our CQuestGB carpet backing. This technology, which\nis part of our ReEntry®2.0 carpet reclamation program, allows us to send some of the reclaimed face fiber back to our fiber\nsupplier to be blended with virgin or other post-industrial materials and extruded into new fiber.\nThe environmental management systems of our floorcovering manufacturing facilities in LaGrange, Georgia, West Point,\nGeorgia, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, China and Australia are certified under International Standards Organization (ISO)\nStandard No. 14001. Nora’s manufacturing facility, which is located in Weinheim, Germany, is ISO14001 certified as well and\nsells the majority of its products with the Blauer Engel label. Blauer Engel is the leading German institute that recognizes products\nthat have environmentally friendly aspects.\nSales and Marketing\nWe distribute our products through two primary channels: (1) direct sales to end users; and (2) indirect sales through\nindependent contractors, installers and distributors. We use an exclusive third-party distributor to sell our products in the Latin\nAmerican region. We have traditionally focused our carpet marketing strategy on major accounts, seeking to build lasting\nrelationships with national and multinational end-users, and on architects, interior designers, engineers, contracting firms, and\nother specifiers who often make or significantly influence purchasing decisions. While the corporate office market segment,\nincluding new construction and renovation, is our largest, we also emphasize sales in other market segments, including schools\nand educational facilities, government institutions, retail space, healthcare facilities, tenant improvement space, hospitality\ncenters, residences and home office space. Our marketing efforts are enhanced by the established and well-known brand names\nof our carpet products, including Interface and FLOR, as well as the strength of the nora rubber flooring brands of noraplan and\nnorament.\nAn important part of our marketing and sales efforts involves the preparation of custom-made samples of requested carpet\ndesigns, in conjunction with the development of innovative product designs and styles to meet the customer’s particular needs.\nIn most cases, we can produce samples to customer specifications in less than five days, which significantly enhances our\nmarketing and sales efforts. In addition, through our websites, we have made it easy to view and request samples of our products.\nWe also use technology which allows us to provide digital, simulated samples of our products, which helps reduce raw material\nand energy consumption associated with our samples.\nWe primarily use our internal marketing and sales force teams to market our flooring products. In order to implement our\nglobal marketing efforts, we have product showrooms or design studios in the United States, England, France, Germany, Spain,\nthe Netherlands, India, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. We may open offices in\nother locations around the world as necessary to capitalize on emerging marketing opportunities.\n6\nBusiness Strategy and Principal Initiatives\nOur business strategy is to continue to use our leading position in modular carpet, product design and global made-to-order\ncapabilities as a platform from which to position our modular carpet, LVT products, rubber flooring, and other resilient products\nacross several industry segments.\nWe will seek to increase revenues and profitability by pursuing the following key initiatives:\nContinue to Penetrate Non-Corporate Office Market Segments. We plan to continue our strategic focus on product design\nand marketing and sales efforts for non-corporate office market segments such as government, education, healthcare, hospitality,\nand residential living. We began this initiative as part of a market diversification strategy to reduce our exposure to the economic\ncyclicality of the corporate office market segment, and it has become a principal strategy generally for growing our business and\nenhancing profitability.\nDevelop a Substantial Resilient Flooring Business. Building upon the success of our products in the high growth LVT market,\nwe plan to expand our LVT product offerings while also seeking to introduce new products in the resilient flooring category. We\nbelieve our ability to offer and sell our soft and hard surfaces in an integrated flooring design helps meet the needs of our customers\nby complementing and enhancing our carpet tile portfolio with true modular installation, no transition strips between surfaces,\ncarpet tile and resilient products that are in some cases the same size and shape, and favorable acoustic properties. Our nora\nbusiness, with its rubber flooring products, is also a key component of our strategy in this area.\nSustain Leadership in Product Design and Development. Our CQuest backings, Embodied Beauty collection, and our plank,\nSkinny Plank, and i2 products and TacTiles installation system have confirmed our position as an innovation leader in modular\ncarpet. We will continue initiatives to sustain, augment and capitalize upon that strength to continue to increase our market share\nin targeted market segments. Our Climate Take Back initiative, which was advanced in 2020 with the launch of our first ever\ncradle-to-gate carbon negative carpet tile, promotes our commitment to the pursuit of sustainability.\nSeasonality\nAs we execute on our strategy to penetrate non-corporate office market segments, sales in the education market segment\nhave increased, in recent years, particularly in the second and third quarters as schools undertake renovation projects during the\nsummer months when schools are typically closed.\nCompetition\nWe compete, on a global basis, in the sale of our modular carpet products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers\nof vinyl and other types of floorcoverings, including broadloom carpet. Although the industry has experienced significant\nconsolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. A number of domestic and foreign competitors manufacture\nmodular carpet as one segment of their business, and some of these competitors have financial resources greater than ours. In\naddition, some of the competing carpet manufacturers have the ability to extrude at least some of their requirements for fiber used\nin carpet products and own manufacturing facilities for their resilient product offerings which decreases their dependence on\nthird-party suppliers.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our primary floorcovering markets are brand recognition, quality, design,\nservice, broad product lines, product performance, marketing strategy, pricing and sustainability. In the corporate office market\nsegment, modular carpet competes with various floorcoverings including broadloom carpet, LVT and polished concrete. We\nbelieve the quality, service, design, better and longer average product performance, flexibility (such as design options, selective\nrotation or replacement, and use in combination with our resilient products), environmental footprint and convenience of our\nmodular carpet are our principal competitive advantages.\n7\nWe believe we have competitive advantages in several other areas as well. First, having both an internal design staff as well\nas our relationship with David Oakey Designs allows us to introduce numerous innovative and attractive carpet tile and resilient\nproducts to our customers. Additionally, we believe that our global carpet tile manufacturing capabilities are an important\ncompetitive advantage in serving the needs of multinational corporate customers. We believe that the incorporation of the\nIntersept antimicrobial chemical agent into the backing of some modular carpet products enhances our ability to compete\nsuccessfully across some of our market segments.\nOur sustainability goals are a brand-enhancing, competitive strength as well as a strategic initiative. Our customers are\nincreasingly concerned about the environmental and broader ecological implications of their operations and the products they use\nin them. Our leadership, knowledge and expertise in the area, especially in the “green building” movement and related\nenvironmental certification programs, resonate deeply with many of our customers and prospects around the globe. Our modular\ncarpet products historically have had inherent installation and maintenance advantages that have translated into greater efficiency\nand waste reduction. We are using raw materials and production technologies, such as our ReEntry 2.0 reclaimed carpet separation\nprocess and our new CQuest backings, that directly reduce the adverse impact of those operations on the environment and limit\nour dependence on petrochemicals.\nProduct Design, Research and Development\nWe maintain an active research and development, product development and design staff. We also draw on the research and\ndevelopment efforts of our suppliers, particularly in the areas of fibers, yarns and modular carpet backing materials. The research\nand development team provides us with technical support and advanced materials research and development. Innovation and\nincreased customization in product design and styling are the principal focus of our product development efforts, and this focus\nhas led to several design breakthroughs such as our CQuest backings, plank and Skinny Plank products, as well as our i2 product\nline. Our carpet design and development team is recognized as an industry leader in carpet design and product engineering for\nthe commercial and institutional markets.\nDavid Oakey Designs provides carpet design and consulting services to us pursuant to a consulting agreement, and this firm\naugments our internal research, development and design staff. David Oakey Designs’ services under the agreement include\ncreating commercial carpet designs for use by our modular carpet businesses throughout the world and overseeing product\ndevelopment, design and coloration functions for our modular carpet business in North America. The agreement can be terminated\nby either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party.\nIn 2020, we launched our first ever cradle-to-gate carbon negative carpet tile. Our goal is to offer products with the lowest\ncarbon footprint possible and products that help maintain a climate fit for life. Our carbon negative carpet tile features carbon\nnegative materials in the CQuestBioX backing in combination with specialty yarns and tufting processes. We have developed\ninnovative ways to work with recycled content and bio-based materials, which has led us to make carpet tiles that store carbon,\npreventing its release into the atmosphere.\nFor our nora rubber flooring products, the innovation focus is on performance and design. A key innovation is the self-\nadhesive nTx solution for nora tiles and sheet goods. Notable changes in design include noraplan Iona introducing a rubber on\nrubber print, noraplan valua introducing natural woodlike colors and embossing, and noraplan unita that incorporates real granite\nparts in a rubber floor. The combination of performance and design makes nora the recognized market leader in rubber flooring.\nEnvironmental and Sustainability Initiatives\nOur sustainability strategy began more than 25 years ago with initiatives aimed at reducing waste, environmental footprint\nand costs. With our more recent Climate Take Back initiative, we seek to lead industry in designing and making products in ways\nthat will maintain a climate fit for life. Our Climate Take Back logo appears on many of our marketing and merchandising\nmaterials distributed throughout the world. With our new CQuestGB, CQuestBio and CQuestBioX backings, we are able to use\nmore bio-based and recycled materials. As more customers in our target markets share our view that sustainability is an important\nfactor, we expect sustainability will become a determining factor in purchasing and design decisions. In 2021, we set a goal to\nreduce our CO2 emissions across our Company and supply chain by 2030 with targets validated by the Science Based Targets\nInitiative. Our targets are to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year,\nand to reduce our absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions from purchased goods and services 50% and from business travel\nand employee commuting 30% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. We also set a separate goal to become a carbon negative enterprise\nby 2040.\n8\nIn 2022, we became the first and only flooring manufacturer to achieve third-party Carbon Neutral Enterprise certification.\nOur claim of Carbon Neutral Enterprise status has been third-party certified to meet the PAS 2060 standard, the leading\ninternational carbon neutrality standard created by the British Standards Institution (BSI). The Carbon Neutral Enterprise\ncertification builds on our history as a purpose-driven flooring company. Achieving Carbon Neutral Enterprise status is a\ncontinuation of our innovation efforts and it brings us one step closer to becoming a carbon negative enterprise by 2040.\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nWe are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that address various aspects of our business such as\nworker safety, privacy, trade sanctions and anticorruption. In addition, our operations are subject to laws and regulations relating\nto the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. The costs of\ncomplying with these laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of\noperations in the past and are not expected to have a material adverse impact in the future. The environmental management\nsystems of our floorcovering manufacturing facilities in LaGrange, Georgia, West Point, Georgia, Northern Ireland, the\nNetherlands, China, Germany and Australia are certified under ISO Standard No. 14001.\nBacklog\nOur backlog of unshipped orders was approximately $195.5 million at February 4, 2024, compared with approximately\n$197.4 million at February 5, 2023. Historically, backlog is subject to significant fluctuations due to the timing of orders for\nindividual large projects. Disruptions in supply and distribution chains have resulted in delays of construction projects and\nflooring installations in many regions worldwide, which also have caused, and may continue to cause, fluctuations in our backlog.\nPatents and Trademarks\nWe own numerous patents in the United States and abroad on floorcovering products and on manufacturing processes. The\nduration of United States patents is between 14 and 20 years from the date of filing of a patent application or issuance of the\npatent; the duration of patents issued in other countries varies from country to country. We maintain an active patent and trade\nsecret program in order to protect our proprietary technology, know-how and trade secrets. Although we consider our patents to\nbe very valuable assets, we consider our know-how and technology even more important to our current business than patents,\nand, accordingly, believe that expiration of existing patents or non-issuance of patents under pending applications would not have\na material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe also own many trademarks in the United States and abroad. In addition to the United States, the primary jurisdictions in\nwhich we have registered our trademarks are the European Union, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and\nvarious countries in Central America, South America and Asia. Some of our more prominent registered trademarks include:\nInterface, FLOR, GlasBac, CQuest, Climate Take Back, nora, norament, noraplan, nTX solution, noraplan unita, noraplan valua,\nand TacTiles. Trademark registrations in the United States are valid for a period of 10 years and are renewable for additional 10-\nyear periods as long as the mark remains in actual use. The duration of trademarks registered in other jurisdictions varies.\n9\nHuman Capital\nInterface is a purpose-driven company with a passionate team that shares a unique set of values. We strive to do the right\nthing and to be generous to people and the planet. We are committed to an equitable and inclusive culture and achieve this by\nliving our values. Our core values represent who we are, how we see the world, how we treat each other and our external customers\nand stakeholders, and how we approach our work every day. These core values are:\n• Design a better way;\n• Be genuine and generous;\n• Inspire others;\n• Connect the whole; and\n• Embrace tomorrow, today.\nAt December 31, 2023, we employed a total of 3,619 employees worldwide. Of such total, 1,367 were clerical, staff, sales,\nsupervisory and management personnel and 2,252 were manufacturing personnel.\nSome of our employees in Australia, the United Kingdom and China are represented by unions. In the Netherlands, a Works\nCouncil, the members of which are Interface employees, is required to be consulted by management with respect to certain matters\nrelating to our operations in that country, such as a change in control of Interface Europe B.V. (our modular carpet subsidiary\nbased in the Netherlands), and the approval of the Works Council is required for some of our actions, including changes in\ncompensation scales or employee benefits. The majority of our employees in Germany are represented by a Works Council as\nwell. Our management believes that its relations with the Works Councils, the unions and our employees are good.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nOur executive officers, their ages as of December 31, 2023, and their principal positions with us are set forth below.

RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common\nstock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of\noperations and prospects.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Operations\nWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these\ncompetitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in\nour business, or competing on product design or sustainability.\nThe floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet\nmanufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation,\na large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. In prior years, some of our competitors were adding manufacturing\ncapacity into the industry throughout the globe which increased the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our\ncompetitors could result in pricing pressure on our products and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both\nrevenues and profitability.\nSome of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular\ncarpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively\nmay require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network,\nand sales and marketing activities.\nIn addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we\nadapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it\ncould negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings that more closely align with their design\npreferences. Moreover, as our competitors improve the sustainability attributes of their products and operations, or if our\ncompetitors market the sustainability attributes of their products or operations more effectively than we do, it could negatively\naffect the degree to which we differentiate from our competitors on those attributes which could negatively affect our ability to\ncompete and gain those sales as customers choose product offerings from our competitors instead of our product offerings. In\nsituations such as these, we may be required by accounting rules to recognize a loss for the write-down of the value of our\ninventory due to its age or obsolescence.\nOur earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, when a test of goodwill assets indicates a\nmaterial impairment of those assets.\nAs prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the\ngoodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless\nthere has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible\ngoodwill impairment. A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect\nour earnings for any such future period.\nWe recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $121.3\nmillion in the first quarter of 2020. The 2022 impairment charge was primarily a result of macroeconomic conditions, such as\ninflation, rising interest rates and the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar causing a negative impact to our revenue and\noperating income in our EMEA goodwill reporting unit. The 2020 impairment charge was primarily a result of the expected\nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated negative impact to our revenue and operating income. Future impairment\ncharges could result if these macroeconomic conditions or other negative market events or conditions continue to impact our\noperations.\n12\nOur success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our\nprincipal design consultant and other key personnel (including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel), and our loss\nof any of them could affect us adversely.\nWe believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives.\nIn addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design\nstaff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive\nconsulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by\neither party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention\nof other key personnel, including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel.\nThe increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite\nskill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience. In certain locations where we operate, the\ndemand for labor has exceeded the supply of labor, resulting in higher costs. Despite our focused efforts to attract and retain\nemployees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our\nhourly workforce in recent years, particularly in 2021, that exceeded historical levels and we incurred higher operating costs at\ncertain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay. The market for professional workers was, and remains,\nsimilarly challenging. Many of our professional workers continue to work part time or full time from home, initially as part of\nour COVID-19 protocols and more recently as part of our hybrid working arrangement policies. As a result, we may experience\nhigher levels of attrition within our professional workforce in the future.\nWe may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become\nuncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive\nchange, including economic downturns. The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience —\nparticularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management — could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the\nCompany relatively unattractive as an employer.\nWe continue to implement changes within our sales organization, including to the standardized processes and systems that\nour sales force uses to go to market, interact with customers, work with architects and the design community and, in general,\noperate day-to-day. We also continue to improve and change the technology tools that the sales force is required to use as part of\ntheir day-to-day jobs and monitor managerial positions that are designed to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of\nthese changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees.\nThere are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead\nadversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability.\nLarge increases in the cost of our raw materials, shipping costs, duties or tariffs could adversely affect us if we are unable to\npass these cost increases through to our customers.\nPetroleum-based products (including yarn) comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in\nmanufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum-based products as feedstock as well. We also incur significant shipping\nand transport costs to move our products around the globe, and those costs have increased dramatically due to global supply\nchain, macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases,\ncontinued inflation and volatility in the cost of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs could continue to adversely affect\nour financial results if we are unable to pass through such cost increases to our customers.\n13\nUnanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber\nor our primary third-party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) or other key raw materials could have a material adverse\neffect on us.\nWe depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and are largely dependent upon two primary suppliers\nfor our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers\nof synthetic fiber (nylon), our primary suppliers of LVT, or other key raw material suppliers, including failure by any third-party\nsupplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to\nmanufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for\na variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for\nreasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages,\nflooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our largest supplier of LVT is located in South Korea.\nIf any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber, our primary suppliers of LVT, or suppliers of\nother key raw materials are terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays\nin our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic\nfiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our\npart to source synthetic fiber included in our products, LVT, or other key raw materials on a cost-effective basis could adversely\nimpact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such\nvolatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your\ninvestment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect\non the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We cannot\npredict the market price for our common stock going forward.\nChanges to our facilities, manufacturing processes, product construction, and product composition could disrupt our\noperations, increase our manufacturing costs, increase customer complaints, increase warranty claims, negatively affect our\nreputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we make improvements and changes to our physical facilities, move operations to other sites, and change\nour manufacturing processes. In the first quarter of 2022, we permanently closed our carpet tile manufacturing facility in Thailand\nand transferred that production volume to other existing manufacturing operations in China and Australia. Large scale changes\nor moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results.\nWe are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, processes, product compositions,\nand product construction including but not limited to the production of our CQuest™ carpet tile backings. These changes can be\ndisruptive. There is also no guarantee that our CQuest™ backings will perform as expected and will not increase warranty claims\nor customer complaints. These efforts may also not yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to\nachieve from them. While these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially impact our financial\nresults in negative ways due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, increased\ncustomer complaints, or increased warranty claims; all of which could negatively affect our operations, reputation, financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, fire,\nadverse weather conditions, pandemics, endemics, unstable geopolitical situations or other unexpected events.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business\ninterruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, storms,\ntornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, whether or not as a result of climate change, or by fire or other unexpected events such as\nadverse weather conditions, acts of war, terrorism, protests, energy shortages and disruptions, pandemics or other public health\ncrises or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities\narising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have\na material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These types of events could also affect\nour suppliers, installers, and customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n14\nDisruptions to or failures of information technology systems we use could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. Some\nof these systems are owned and operated by us, and some are owned or operated by third parties pursuant to leases, licenses or\nother contracts with those third parties. We rely on these systems to, among other things:\n• facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;\n• control our production processes;\n• manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;\n• receive, process and ship orders;\n• manage billing, collections, cash applications, customer service, and payables;\n• manage financial reporting; and\n• manage payroll and human resources information.\nThe IT systems we use may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:\n• natural disasters, like fires;\n• power loss;\n• software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; and\n• hacking, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, compromised or\nirretrievable backups or other cyber-attacks.\nAny of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These\ndisruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm.\nDespite security designs and internal controls, the IT systems we use have in the past experienced, and may in the future\nbecome subject to, attempts by unauthorized third parties to access and exfiltrate confidential information, manipulate data or\ndisrupt our operations. In November 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties,\naffecting our IT systems (the “Cyber Event”). In response, we promptly shut down certain systems, including shipping, inventory\nmanagement and production systems, and engaged forensic experts to evaluate the extent of the Cyber Event and its disruption\nto our operations. The investigation of the Cyber Event by our forensic experts was completed during fiscal year 2023.\nIn fiscal year 2022, in connection with the Cyber Event, our revenues were adversely affected by approximately $8 million\ndue to lost sales. Additionally, we incurred Cyber Event costs of approximately $5 million in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to\nidle plant costs, direct labor costs during the period our manufacturing facilities were idle and third-party remediation costs. We\nhave insurance and anticipate that a portion of our financial losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be recovered by\ninsurance.\nFollowing the Cyber Event, we implemented measures to enhance our cybersecurity protections against, and reduce the\npotential of, any future cybersecurity attack. We expect to incur ongoing costs to enhance cybersecurity and plan to take further\nsteps to prevent unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data.\nHowever, there is no guarantee that these enhancements and steps will be adequate to mitigate future losses due to IT system\ndisruptions, and we may incur significant expense in correcting and recovering from future disruptions.\nTo the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including data related to customers, employees or other parties, security\nbreaches may expose us to fines and other liabilities, and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as\ncybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated and numerous, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be\nexpected to rise.\n15\nThe impact of potential changes to environmental laws and regulations and industry standards regarding climate change and\nother sustainability matters could lead to unforeseen disruptions to our business operations.\nAddressing the effects of climate change has taken on increased importance throughout the world. The continued efforts to\ncombat climate change could include more restrictive federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, heightened\nindustry standards, or other mitigation measures that may have a material adverse effect on our global operations. These initiatives\ncould, for example, increase the cost of obtaining raw materials for production of our products, increase the cost of energy for\nour manufacturing processes, negatively impact our supply chain and capital expenditures, or increase our administrative costs.\nIn 2021, we established and publicly disclosed targets and other commitments related to certain sustainability matters,\nincluding a goal to reduce our CO2 emissions across our Company and supply chain by 2030. We also set a goal to become a\ncarbon negative enterprise by 2040. If we are unable to meet these targets or commitments on our projected timelines or at all, or\nif they are perceived negatively, including the perception that they are not sufficiently robust or, conversely, are too costly, our\nreputation as well as our relationships with investors, customers and other stakeholders could be harmed, which could in turn\nadversely impact our business, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nSales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles, and effects in the new\nconstruction market and renovation market.\nSales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This\nactivity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and\nother factors that lead to cost control measures or reduction in the use of space by businesses and other users of commercial or\ninstitutional space. In addition, the effects of cyclicality and other factors affecting the corporate office segment have traditionally\ntended to be more pronounced than the effects on other market segments. Historically, we have generated more sales in the\ncorporate office segment than in any other segment. The effects of cyclicality and other factors on the new construction segment\nof the market have also tended in the past to be more pronounced than the effects on the renovation segment. These effects may\nrecur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened by negative cycles or other\nfactors.\nHealth crisis events, such as epidemics or pandemics, have adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, the economy and\ndisrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHealth crisis events, including epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, have impacted areas where we operate and sell\nour products and could have additional impacts on economic growth, supply chains, and foreign currency exchange rates.\nRecently, prolonged government imposed COVID-19 restrictions in China and the slow post-COVID recovery in the country\nadversely impacted our sales in China during fiscal years 2022 and 2023. A public health emergency in the future could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our ability to operate, our results of operations, financial condition, and demand for our products.\n16\nInternational Risk Factors\nOur substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely\naffect our business results, including foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive taxation, custom duties, border closings or\nother adverse government regulations.\nWe have substantial international operations and intend to continue to pursue and commit resources to growth opportunities\nbeyond the United States. Outside of the United States, we maintain manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, the United\nKingdom, China, Australia and Germany, in addition to product showrooms or design studios in England, France, Germany,\nSpain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. In 2023,\napproximately 46% of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe\nand Asia-Pacific.\nInternational operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as: the complexities and expense of administering a\nbusiness abroad; complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements;\nforeign laws, international import and export legislation; trading and investment policies; economic and political instability in the\nglobal markets; foreign currency fluctuations; exchange controls; increased nationalism and protectionism; crime and social\ninstability; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; potential adverse tax consequences and\nincreasing tax complexity or changes in tax law associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions; uncertainties of laws and\nenforcement relating to intellectual property and privacy rights; difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in\ncompliance with diverse local laws and customs, including health and safety regulations and wage and hour laws; potential\ngovernmental expropriation (especially in countries with undemocratic or authoritarian ruling parties); and other factors\ndepending upon the jurisdiction involved. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these risks in the future.\nIn addition, due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations and international\noperations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict\nwhere we can do business, what information or products we can import and export to and from certain countries and what\ninformation we can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican National Anticorruption System (Sistema Nacional\nAnticorrupción, or “SNA”), the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money\nlaundering regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such regulations; however, there is\na risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners\nor representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable\ncompliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions\nand/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In\naddition, we are subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation,\nadministration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures or\noperations.\nFinally, we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions. The risks outlined above,\nand others specific to certain jurisdictions that we may not be aware of, could adversely and materially affect our business and\nresults.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war could adversely affect our business, results of operations\nand financial position.\nGiven the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and\nregions, including geopolitical risks arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.\n17\nHistorically, Russia was a key supplier of natural gas, oil, and other raw materials to European countries. We have substantial\nmanufacturing operations in Europe (including Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), and we have key suppliers\nin Europe, which rely upon natural gas, oil, and other raw materials to operate. Our sole rubber flooring plant is in Germany, and\nour primary European carpet tile plant is in the Netherlands. Any disruption in the supply of natural gas, oil, or other raw materials\nfrom Russia to Europe could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our results of operations and our financial\nposition, or adversely affect the ability of our key suppliers to meet our raw material requirements. In particular, the currently\nreduced Russian exports of natural gas to Europe may materially impede our European manufacturing operations and may result\nin higher energy costs to operate our facilities. Our customers’ businesses, results of operations and financial positions also could\nbe adversely impacted by the conflict in Ukraine, which could reduce their spending on our products. While we permanently\nclosed our operations in Russia in the third quarter of 2022, the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on us as well\nas the global economy cannot be predicted.\nThe conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war are ongoing and the duration of the conflict and war are\nuncertain. We cannot predict the outcome of the conflict and war or the impact on the broader region, as the conflict and war and\nrelated government actions are evolving and are beyond our control. To the extent the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and\nthe Israel-Hamas war adversely affects our business, the conflict and war may also have the effect of heightening other risks\ndisclosed in our Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation\nand corporate and consumer spending; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom\nattack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to maintain or increase our\nprices, including fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; further disruptions in global supply chains; terrorist activities\ntargeting business infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the\ncapital markets. Other potential consequences of the ongoing conflict and war include or may include government sanctions,\nembargoes, unstable energy markets, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential retaliatory action by the governments\ninvolved in the conflict and war against companies or other countries, and increased tensions between the involved governments\nand the United States or other countries in which we operate.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have adversely affected our results of operations and\nfinancial position and could continue to do so. In recent periods, as the value of the U.S. dollar has strengthened in comparison\nto certain foreign currencies — particularly in our EAAA segment and the impact of the Euro on our European operations — our\nreported revenues have been negatively impacted. As approximately 46% of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies,\nthese exchange rate fluctuations have had, and could continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the ongoing implementation and effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, and related\nnegative developments in the European Union, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nIn 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as “Brexit”).\nThe U.K. ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European\nUnion agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and\nwill require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work\non the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the\nrelationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit\nhas had, and the ongoing implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our\nproducts in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory,\neconomic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could\nalso have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and\nelsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or\nboth of the Euro and the British Pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of\nsales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other\nunpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the\nU.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.\n18\nRisk Factors Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations\nand our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $421.7\nmillion of outstanding debt, and we had $298.4 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our Syndicated Credit Facility.\nThis level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n• making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;\n• resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our\ndebt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n• reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic\ninvestments and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these\npurposes;\n• subjecting us to the risk of increasing interest expense on variable rate indebtedness, including borrowings under our\nSyndicated Credit Facility;\n• limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the\nindustry in which we operate and the general economy;\n• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n• limiting our ability to attract certain investors to purchase our common stock due to the amount of debt we have\noutstanding; and\n• limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.\nIn addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense\nwill increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. For information regarding\nthe current variable interest rates of these borrowings and the potential impact on our interest expense from hypothetical increases\nin short term interest rates, please see the discussion in Item 7A of this Report.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nand our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.\n19\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to\npay our indebtedness.\nOur ability to generate cash in order to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our\nindebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and\nother factors beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend\non the satisfaction of the covenants in our Syndicated Credit Facility and our other financing agreements, including the indenture\ngoverning the Senior Notes, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need to maintain certain\nfinancial ratios under our Syndicated Credit Facility. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from\noperations in the future and future borrowings may not be available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or from other\nsources in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, to make necessary capital expenditures\nor to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or through borrowings, we may be\nrequired to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms\nthat may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness will\ndepend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, as well as the terms of our financing agreements, including\nthe Syndicated Credit Facility, and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We may not be able to engage in any of these\nactivities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition,\nborrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if\nthe underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial\nindebtedness.\nSubject to the restrictions in our Syndicated Credit Facility and in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we and our\nsubsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Syndicated Credit Facility and the indenture\ngoverning the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of\nsignificant qualifications and exceptions, including the ability, on a non-committed basis, for us to increase revolving\ncommitments and/or term loans under our Syndicated Credit Facility, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions\ncould be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks we now face would\nincrease.\nLegal Risk Factors\nWe face risks associated with litigation and claims.\nWe have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions and proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment\nclaims made by our current or former employees, or claims relating to intellectual property matters. Litigation might result in\nsubstantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of\noperations and financial condition. An unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay\nmonetary damages. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve\none or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, an unfavorable judgment\nin which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nPlease refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” within this Report for additional information related to litigation and claims.\nITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n20\nITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management Strategy\nAssess, Identify and Manage Material Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\nInterface has integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader enterprise risk management framework. This\nintegration ensures that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our entity-level risk assessment and decision-making\nprocess. Cybersecurity risk management is also a vital part our IT incident management and disaster recovery policy that outlines\na systematic approach of implementing and executing strategies and procedures to enable the recovery and restoration of vital\nbusiness functions and IT infrastructure following a significant disruptive event.\nEngagement of Third Parties\nInterface engages a range of external experts in evaluating and testing our cybersecurity risk management systems. These\npartnerships enable us to leverage specialized knowledge and insights, ensuring our cybersecurity strategies and processes remain\nat the forefront of industry best practices. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, the Company uses external experts to assist\nwith an investigation of the incident, an evaluation of the extent to which the cybersecurity event has impacted the Company’s\noperations, financial condition, and IT infrastructure, and the recovery and restoration following the incident.\nWe evaluate the inherent risk associated with using external experts by conducting thorough security assessments before\nengagement and perform ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\nGovernance and Oversight\nThe Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for cybersecurity risk management. The Audit Committee is comprised of\nboard members with diverse experience and expertise to effectively oversee risk, although none of them are cybersecurity experts.\nOur Chief Information Officer, in his capacity, regularly informs the Audit Committee (typically twice per year) and the full board\n(typically once per year) on all aspects related to cybersecurity risks, as well as any remediation efforts in response to a\ncybersecurity incident.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats\nOur IT systems face a myriad of cybersecurity threats, including, without limitation, hacking, computer viruses, denial of\nservice attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, compromised or irretrievable backups, and other cyber attacks. Any of\nthese events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations and lead to production\nor shipping stoppages, revenue loss, and reputational harm.\nTo the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including data related to customers, employees or other parties, risks from\ncybersecurity threats may expose us to fines and other liabilities, and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In\naddition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated and numerous, the costs to defend and insure against\ncyberattacks can be expected to rise.\nOn November 20, 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT\nsystems. In response to this Cyber Event, we notified law enforcement and took steps to supplement existing security monitoring,\nincluding scanning and protective measures. The investigation of the Cyber Event was completed during fiscal year 2023. A more\ndetailed discussion of the Cyber Event can be found in Item 7 entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n21\nITEM 2.

We will continue, however, to consider the desirability of establishing additional facilities and offices in other\nlocations around the world as part of our business strategy to meet global market demands. Substantially all of our owned\nproperties in the United States are subject to mortgages, which secure borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility.\n22\nITEM 3.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TILE. As of February 16, 2024, we had\n578 holders of record of our common stock. We estimate that there are in excess of 11,000 beneficial holders of our common\nstock.\nFuture declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of our Board, and depends upon, among other things, our\ninvestment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other\nfactors that may be considered relevant by our Board at the time of its determination. Such other factors include limitations\ncontained in the agreement for our Syndicated Credit Facility and the indenture for our Senior Notes, each of which specify\nconditions as to when any dividend payments may be made. As such, we may discontinue our dividend payments in the future if\nour Board determines that a cessation of dividend payments is proper in light of the factors indicated above.\nStock Performance\nThe following graph and table compare, for the period comprised of the Company’s five preceding fiscal years ended\nDecember 31, 2023, the Company’s total returns to shareholders (assuming all dividends were reinvested) with that of (i) all\ncompanies listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index, (ii) our previous self-determined peer group, and (iii) our new self-determined\npeer group, assuming an initial investment of $100 in each on December 30, 2018 (the last day of the fiscal year 2018). In 2023,\nthe Company updated its self-determined peer group to exclude Kimball International, Inc., which was acquired in 2023 and no\nlonger trades publicly, and also to incorporate other peer group changes to align with the peer group used to measure executive\ncompensation. In determining its peer group companies, the Company considered various factors, including the potential peer’s\nindustry, business model, size and complexity. The Company chose a peer group that is a better representation of the Company’s\nsize and market capitalization with minimal revenue dispersion, and with companies in similar industries or lines of business or\nsubject to similar economic and business cycles, including companies with a significant international presence that are also\nfocused on sustainability.\n24\nDecember December January 3, January 2, January 1, December\n30, 2018 29, 2019 2021 2022 2023 31, 2023\nInterface, Inc. .............................. $100 $118 $76 $115 $72 $92\nNASDAQ Composite Index ........ $100 $138 $199 $243 $164 $238\nPrevious Self-Determined Peer\n$100 $132 $122 $166 $123 $150\nGroup (16 Stocks) .....................\nNew Self-Determined Peer\n$100 $135 $114 $141 $91 $135\nGroup (12 Stocks) .....................\nNotes to Performance Graph\n(1) If the annual interval, based on the fiscal year-end, is not a trading day, the preceding trading day is used.\n(2) The index level was set to $100 as of December 30, 2018 (the last day of fiscal year 2018).\n(3) The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31.\n(4) The following companies are included in the Previous Self-Determined Peer Group depicted above: Acuity\nBrands, Inc.; Albany International Corp.; Apogee Enterprises, Inc.; Armstrong World Industries, Inc.;\nCaesarstone Ltd.; Enviri Corporation (formerly Harsco Corporation); Gentherm Incorporated; Glatfelter\nCorporation; H.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nOverview\nOur revenues are derived from sales of floorcovering products, primarily modular carpet, resilient flooring, including luxury\nvinyl tile (“LVT”), rubber flooring products, and installation services and accessories. Our business, as well as the commercial\ninteriors industry in general, is cyclical in nature and is impacted by economic conditions and trends that affect the markets for\ncommercial and institutional business space. The commercial interiors industry, including the market for floorcovering products,\nis largely driven by reinvestment by corporations into their existing businesses in the form of new fixtures and furnishings for\ntheir workplaces. In significant part, the timing and amount of such reinvestments are impacted by the profitability of those\ncorporations. As a result, macroeconomic factors such as employment rates, office vacancy rates, work from home policies,\ncapital spending, productivity and efficiency gains that impact corporate profitability in general, also affect our business.\nThe Company has two operating and reportable segments – namely Americas (“AMS”) and Europe, Africa, Asia and\nAustralia (collectively “EAAA”). The AMS operating segment includes the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic\nareas. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional\ninformation. The results of operations discussion below also includes segment information.\nWe focus our marketing and sales efforts on both corporate office and non-corporate office market segments, to reduce\nsomewhat our exposure to economic cycles that affect the corporate office market segment more adversely, as well as to capture\nadditional market share. More than half of our consolidated net sales were in non-corporate office markets in fiscal years 2023,\n2022, and 2021, primarily in education, healthcare, public buildings, residential/living, retail, and hospitality market segments.\nSee Item 1, entitled “Business,” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our mix of\nsales in corporate office verses non-corporate office market segments for the last three fiscal years by reportable segment.\nExecutive Summary\nDuring 2023, we had consolidated net sales of $1,261.5 million, down 2.8% compared to $1,297.9 million in 2022, primarily\ndue to decreased customer demand – particularly in the retail market segment. Consolidated operating income for 2023 was\n$104.5 million compared to consolidated operating income of $75.4 million in 2022, primarily due to a non-recurring goodwill\nand intangible asset impairment charge of $36.2 million recognized in 2022. Consolidated net income for 2023 was $44.5 million,\nor $0.76 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net income of $19.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in 2022.\nDuring 2022, we had consolidated net sales of $1,297.9 million, up 8.1% compared to $1,200.4 million in 2021, primarily\ndue to higher sales in the corporate office, education and retail market segments. Consolidated operating income for 2022 was\n$75.4 million compared to consolidated operating income of $104.8 million in 2021, primarily due to higher inflationary pressures\non raw materials and freight costs and a $36.2 million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge in 2022. Consolidated net\nincome for 2022 was $19.6 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to consolidated net income of $55.2 million, or $0.94\nper diluted share, in 2021.\nA detailed discussion of our 2023 and 2022 consolidated and segment performance appears below under “Analysis of Results\nof Operations”.\nCybersecurity Event\nAs previously disclosed, on November 20, 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third\nparties, affecting our IT systems. Promptly, out of an abundance of caution, we shut down certain systems including shipping,\ninventory management and production systems and engaged forensic experts to evaluate the extent of the Cyber Event and its\nimpact to our operations. We also took steps to supplement existing security monitoring, including scanning and protective\nmeasures, and notified law enforcement.\n27\nThe Company substantially resumed its operations within two weeks following the occurrence of the Cyber Event. The\ninvestigation of the Cyber Event by our forensic experts was completed during 2023. We incurred approximately $1.1 million of\ncosts in 2023 in connection with the investigation of the Cyber Event, which were recorded in selling, general and administrative\nexpenses in the consolidated statements of operations. In 2022, we estimated that the Cyber Event adversely affected our fiscal\nyear 2022 revenues by approximately $8 million in lost sales. We incurred approximately $5 million of costs related to the Cyber\nEvent in 2022 for idle plant costs, direct labor costs during the period our manufacturing facilities were idle and third-party\nremediation costs. Approximately $4.8 million of the Cyber Event costs in 2022 were included in cost of sales in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and approximately $0.3 million were included in selling, general and administrative expenses. We have\ninsurance and anticipate that a portion of our financial losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be covered by insurance.\nWe expect to incur ongoing costs for enhanced data security against unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and\ndata.\nImpact of Macroeconomic Conditions\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the continued disruption in economic markets due to ongoing inflation, increases in interest rates,\nthe Russia-Ukraine war, the onset of the Israel-Hamas war, a fairly stabilized but still challenging supply chain environment, a\nslow post COVID recovery in China and slow market conditions in the rest of Asia, and significant financial pressures in the\ncommercial office market globally, all posed challenges for us. Management believes it is reasonably likely that these challenges\nwill continue to affect our future operations and demand for our products to some degree during fiscal year 2024. We are also\nanticipating decreases in the cost of raw materials and freight, offset by continued unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost\nabsorption during fiscal year 2024. To mitigate these impacts, we plan to continue evaluating our cost structure and global\nmanufacturing footprint to identify and activate opportunities to decrease costs and optimize our global cost structure.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic had less of an impact on our overall financial results compared with the\nprior year as consolidated net sales increased 8.1% compared to 2021. Government imposed COVID-19 lockdowns and\nrestrictions in parts of China in 2022 adversely impacted sales in China by approximately 13% compared to 2021. Global supply\nchain challenges and inflationary pressures in 2022 resulted in higher raw material costs, higher freight costs and shipping delays,\nwhich increased our operating costs and adversely impacted our gross profit margin in 2022.\n28\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nThe following discussion and analyses reflect the factors and trends discussed in the preceding sections.\nConsolidated net sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar were approximately 46% in 2023, 47% in 2022,\nand 50% in 2021. Because we have substantial international operations, we are impacted, from time to time, by international\ndevelopments that affect foreign currency transactions. In 2023, the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar had a positive\nimpact on our net sales, partially offset by the weakening of the Australian dollar, Chinese Renminbi, and Canadian dollar.\nCurrency fluctuations had no material impact to operating income in 2023. In 2022, the weakening of the Euro, Australian dollar,\nBritish Pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar had a negative impact on our net sales and operating income.\nIn 2021, the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar\nhad a positive impact on our net sales and operating income.\nThe following table presents the amounts (in U.S. dollars) by which the exchange rates for translating Euros, British Pounds\nsterling, Australian dollars, Chinese Renminbi and Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars have affected our consolidated net sales and\noperating income during the past three years:\n2023 2022 2021\n(in millions)\nImpact of changes in foreign currency on consolidated\nnet sales ......................................................................... $ 1.4 $ (58.8) $ 23.9\nImpact of changes in foreign currency on consolidated\noperating income ...........................................................

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates had a\npositive impact on our year-over-year consolidated net sales comparison of approximately $1.4 million, meaning that if currency\nlevels had remained constant year-over-year, our 2023 net sales would have been lower by this amount. On a market segment\nbasis, the sales decrease was most significant in the retail and healthcare market segments partially offset by increases in education\nand residential living market segments. See the segment results discussion below for additional information on market segments.\nConsolidated net sales for 2022 compared with 2021\nFor 2022, our consolidated net sales increased $97.5 million (8.1%) compared to 2021, comprised of higher sales volumes\n(approximately 5.4%) and higher prices (approximately 2.7%, including the impact of currency fluctuations). Fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates had a negative impact on our year-over-year consolidated net sales comparison of approximately\n$58.8 million, meaning that if currency levels had remained constant year-over-year, our 2022 net sales would have been higher\nby this amount. On a market segment basis, the sales increase was most significant in the corporate office, retail and education\nmarket segments. See the segment results discussion below for additional information on market segments.\nConsolidated Cost and Expenses\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of sales and selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses during\nthe past three years:\nFiscal Year Percentage Change\n2023 2022 2021\n2023 compared 2022 compared\n(in thousands) with 2022 with 2021\nConsolidated cost of sales .................. $ 820,429 $ 860,186 $ 767,665 (4.6) % 12.1 %\nConsolidated selling, general and\nadministrative expenses ................... 339,049 324,190 324,315 4.6 % 0.0 %\nConsolidated Cost of Sales\nFor 2023, our consolidated cost of sales decreased $39.8 million (4.6%) compared to 2022, primarily due to lower sales and\nlower freight costs (approximately $19 million) due to stabilizing supply chain conditions. Currency translation had no material\nimpact on consolidated cost of sales compared to 2022. As a percentage of net sales, our consolidated cost of sales decreased to\n65.0% in 2023 versus 66.3% in 2022. Management believes it is reasonably likely that lower inflation and decreases in the cost\nof raw materials, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost absorption, will continue to some degree in 2024,\nparticularly in the first half of 2024. Management expects to continue managing the fixed cost under-absorption through higher\nsales prices, product mix and plant productivity initiatives.\nFor 2022, our consolidated cost of sales increased $92.5 million (12.1%) compared to 2021, primarily due to higher sales\nand continuing inflationary pressures on raw materials and freight costs. The increase in consolidated cost of sales was also\nimpacted by higher energy costs (which were up approximately 28%) in our EAAA segment primarily due to shortages in the\nsupply of natural gas in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Currency translation had a positive\nimpact on consolidated cost of sales of approximately $37.2 million (4.8%) compared to 2021. The increase in cost of sales in\n2022 also included $4.8 million of costs related to the Cyber Event, as discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, our\nconsolidated cost of sales increased to 66.3% in 2022 versus 64.0% in 2021, due to higher raw materials, freight and energy costs,\nas discussed above.\n30\nConsolidated Gross Profit\nFor 2023, consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 35.0% compared to 33.7% for 2022. The increase in\ngross profit percentage was primarily due to (i) higher pricing (approximately 4%), partially offset by (ii) the unfavorable impact\nof inflation on raw material costs (approximately 1%), and (iii) unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost absorption and product mix\n(approximately 2%). Management believes it is reasonably likely that lower inflation and decreases in the cost of raw materials,\npartially offset by unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost absorption, will continue to some degree in 2024, particularly in the first\nhalf of 2024. Management expects to continue managing the fixed cost under-absorption through higher sales prices, product\nmix, and plant productivity measures.\nFor 2022, consolidated gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 33.7% compared to 36.0% for 2021. The decrease was\nprimarily due to inflationary pressures for raw materials and freight costs.\nConsolidated SG&A Expenses\nFor 2023, our consolidated SG&A expenses were $339.0 million versus $324.2 million in 2022. Currency translation had a\n$1.5 million (0.5%) negative impact on the year-over-year comparison. Consolidated SG&A expenses increased $14.9 million\n(4.6%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to (i) $6.5 million of higher selling expenses due to sales and marketing\ninitiatives, (ii) $6.3 million of higher severance costs driven by employee headcount reductions and initiatives to reduce future\ncosts, (iii) $4.4 million of higher professional fees, and (iv) $1.9 million of higher variable compensation costs. These increases\nwere partially offset by lower plant closure costs of approximately $4.1 million related to the closure of our Thailand and Russia\noperations in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 26.9% in 2023 versus 25.0% in 2022.\nFor 2022, our consolidated SG&A expenses were $324.2 million versus $324.3 million in 2021. Currency translation had a\n$9.5 million (4.1%) positive impact on the year-over-year comparison. Consolidated SG&A expenses were flat compared to 2021\nas higher selling expenses of approximately $8.5 million due to higher sales were offset by lower labor costs due to prior year\nemployee reductions and $5.4 million in lower professional fees due to prior year insurance recoveries. As a percentage of net\nsales, SG&A expenses decreased to 25.0% in 2022 versus 27.0% in 2021.\nRestructuring Plans\nOn September 8, 2021, the Company committed to a restructuring plan that continued to focus on efforts to improve\nefficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations, involving the closure of the Company’s manufacturing facility in\nThailand. During the second quarter of 2023, the Company completed the sale of the Thailand real estate and recognized a gain\nof $2.7 million.\nDuring 2022, in conjunction with the closure of its Thailand facility, the Company recorded a write-down of inventory of\n$2.5 million within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nSee Note 16 entitled “Restructuring and Other” and Note 7 entitled “Property, Plant and Equipment” of Part II, Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report for additional information.\nGoodwill, Intangible Asset and Fixed Asset Impairment\nDuring 2023, there was no impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. During 2022, we recognized a\ncharge of $36.2 million for the impairment of goodwill and certain intangible assets. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Other\nIntangible Assets” of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.\nDuring 2023, there were no material fixed asset impairment charges. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we recognized fixed\nasset impairment charges of $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for projects that were abandoned. These charges are\nincluded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest Expense\nFor 2023, our interest expense was $31.8 million, versus $29.9 million in 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates on\noutstanding term loan borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility, partially offset by lower outstanding term loan borrowings\nunder the Facility. Our average borrowing rate under the Syndicated Credit Facility as of December 31, 2023, was 6.61%\ncompared to 5.78% at January 1, 2023.\n31\nFor 2022, our interest expense was $29.9 million, versus $29.7 million in 2021. Higher interest rates in 2022 were offset by\nlower outstanding term loan borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility. Our average borrowing rate under the Syndicated\nCredit Facility as of January 1, 2023, was 5.78% compared to 1.91% at January 2, 2022.\nOther Expense\nDuring 2023, other expense, net, was $9.1 million, versus $3.6 million in 2022. The increase was primarily due to the\nsubstantial liquidation of our foreign subsidiaries in Brazil and Russia and the resulting recognition of $6.2 million of cumulative\ntranslation adjustments reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nTax\nFor fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of $19.1 million on pre-tax income of $63.7 million,\nresulting in an effective tax rate of 30.1%. This compares with income tax expense of $22.4 million on pre-tax income of $41.9\nmillion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 53.3%, for fiscal year 2022. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was significantly\nimpacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment\ncharge, the effective tax rate was 31.4% for fiscal year 2022. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023, as\ncompared to fiscal year 2022, excluding the goodwill impairment, was primarily due to favorable changes related to the cash\nsurrender value of Company-owned life insurance, utilization of foreign tax credits, favorable U.S. tax effects from the\nrepatriation of previously taxed foreign earnings, and non-deductible charges related to the closure of the Company’s\nmanufacturing facility in Thailand in fiscal year 2022. This decrease was partially offset by a favorable change to unrecognized\ntax benefits in fiscal year 2022.\nFor fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded income tax expense of $22.4 million on pre-tax income of $41.9 million,\nresulting in an effective tax rate of 53.3%. This compares with income tax expense of $17.4 million on pre-tax income of $72.6\nmillion, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.0% for fiscal year 2021. The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 was significantly\nimpacted by a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the impact of the non-deductible goodwill impairment\ncharge, the effective tax rate was 31.4% for fiscal year 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022, as compared\nto fiscal year 2021, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible employee\ncompensation, an increase in the valuation allowance on net operating loss and interest carryforwards, unfavorable changes\nrelated to the cash surrender value of Company-owned life insurance policies and unfavorable changes related to foreign exchange\nmovements.\nSegment Results\nAs discussed above, the Company has two operating and reportable segments – AMS and EAAA. See Note 20 entitled\n“Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nAMS Segment – Net Sales and Adjusted Operating Income (“AOI”)\nThe following table presents AMS segment net sales and AOI for the last three fiscal years:\nFiscal Year Percentage Change\n2023 2022 2021\n2023 compared 2022 compared\n(in thousands) with 2022 with 2021\nAMS segment net sales ...................... $ 736,955 $ 753,740 $ 651,216 (2.2) % 15.7 %\nAMS segment AOI(1) .......................... 87,789 102,370 85,014 (14.2) % 20.4 %\n(1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses. Excludes Cyber Event costs, intangible asset impairment charge, and restructuring, asset\nimpairment, severance, and other, net. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for\nadditional information.\nAMS segment net sales for 2023 compared with 2022\nDuring 2023, net sales in AMS decreased 2.2% versus 2022, comprised of lower sales volume partially offset by higher\nprices. On a market segment basis, the AMS sales decrease was most significant in the retail (down 50.6%) market segment\npartially offset by increases in the education (up 7.9%), corporate office (up 4.1%) and residential living (up 15.4%) market\nsegments.\n32\nAMS segment net sales for 2022 compared with 2021\nDuring 2022, net sales in AMS increased 15.7% versus 2021, comprised of higher sales volumes and higher prices. On a\nmarket segment basis, the AMS sales increase was most significant in the retail (up 54.2%), education (up 18.9%), public\nbuildings (up 18.0%), corporate office (up 11.7%) and healthcare (up 5.8%) market segments. These increases were partially\noffset by decreases in the consumer residential (down 8.7%) market segment.\nAMS AOI for 2023 compared with 2022\nAOI in AMS decreased 14.2% during 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost\nabsorption and lower sales, partially offset by lower freight costs. AMS SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased\napproximately 1.1% compared to 2022, primarily due to higher selling expenses, which contributed to the decrease in AOI for\nthe current year. As a percentage of net sales, AOI decreased to 11.9% in 2023 versus 13.6% in 2022.\nAMS AOI for 2022 compared with 2021\nAOI in AMS increased 20.4% during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher sales. AMS SG&A expenses as a\npercentage of net sales in 2022 decreased approximately 0.7% compared to 2021, primarily due to lower administrative costs,\nwhich contributed to the increase in AOI in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, AOI increased to 13.6% in 2022 versus 13.1% in\n2021.\nEAAA Segment – Net Sales and AOI\nThe following table presents EAAA segment net sales and AOI for the last three fiscal years:\nFiscal Year Percentage Change\n2023 2022 2021\n2023 compared 2022 compared\n(in thousands) with 2022 with 2021\nEAAA segment net sales .................... $ 524,543 $ 544,179 $ 549,182 (3.6) % (0.9) %\nEAAA segment AOI(1) ........................ 28,608 30,058 37,268 (4.8) % (19.3) %\n(1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses. Excludes goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, purchase accounting\namortization, Thailand plant closure inventory write-down, Cyber Event costs, and restructuring, asset impairment, severance, and other, net.\nSee Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nEAAA segment net sales for 2023 compared with 2022\nDuring 2023, net sales in EAAA decreased 3.6% versus 2022, comprised of lower sales volume partially offset by higher\nselling prices. Slower economic recovery and decreased customer demand in Asia resulted in approximately 25% lower net sales\nin Asia during 2023 compared to 2022. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of approximately $3.5 million (0.6%) on\nEAAA net sales for 2023 compared to 2022 due to the strengthening of the Euro, partially offset by the weakening of the\nAustralian dollar and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the EAAA sales decrease was most\nsignificant in the corporate office (down 3.5%), healthcare (down 23.5%), retail (down 22.8%), and education (down 3.9%)\nmarket segments, partially offset by increases in the hospitality (up 11.5%) market segment.\nEAAA segment net sales for 2022 compared with 2021\nDuring 2022, net sales in EAAA decreased 0.9% versus 2021. Higher selling prices and volume were offset by the impact of\nnegative currency fluctuations of approximately $56.7 million (10.3%) for 2022 compared to 2021 due to the weakening of the\nEuro, Australian dollar, British Pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, EAAA\nsales increased in the corporate office (up 6.2%) and hospitality (up 22.3%) market segments. These increases were offset by\ndecreases in the public buildings (down 25.7%), transportation (down 21.3%), retail (down 14.9%) and healthcare (down 8.2%)\nmarket segments.\n33\nEAAA AOI for 2023 compared with 2022\nAOI in EAAA decreased 4.8% during 2023 versus 2022 primarily due to the impact of lower sales, inflationary pressures on\nraw material costs, and unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost absorption on lower production volumes. Currency fluctuations had\nno material impact on EAAA AOI in 2023 compared to 2022. As a percentage of net sales, AOI was 5.5% in both 2023 and 2022.\nEAAA AOI for 2022 compared with 2021\nAOI in EAAA decreased 19.3% during 2022 versus 2021 due to continuing inflationary pressures on raw materials and\nhigher energy costs (which were up approximately 28%) primarily due to natural gas shortages in connection with the ongoing\nconflict between Russia and Ukraine. The decrease in AOI was also due to negative currency fluctuations of approximately\n$6.5 million (9.9%) due to the weakening of the Euro, Australian dollar, British Pound sterling and Chinese Renminbi against the\nU.S. dollar. EAAA SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2022 decreased approximately 2.5% compared to the prior\nyear, which partially offset the negative impacts on AOI discussed above. As a percentage of net sales, AOI decreased to 5.5% in\n2022 versus 6.8% in 2021.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nIn our business, we require cash and other liquid assets primarily to purchase raw materials and to pay other manufacturing\ncosts, in addition to funding normal course SG&A expenses, anticipated capital expenditures, interest expense and potential\nspecial projects. We generate our cash and other liquidity requirements primarily from our operations and from borrowings under\nour Syndicated Credit Facility (the “Facility”) discussed below. We anticipate that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our\nobligations for the next 12 months, and we expect to generate sufficient cash to meet our long-term obligations.\nBelow are estimates of our material cash requirements for future periods. The short-term period represents payments due\nwithin the 12 months following December 31, 2023, and the long-term period represents payments due beyond the short-term\nperiod.\nPayments Due by Period\nShort-Term Long-Term Total\n(in thousands)\nLong-term debt obligations ................................................................ $ 8,572 $ 413,086 $ 421,658\nOperating and finance lease obligations ............................................. 19,876 106,130 126,006\nExpected interest payments ................................................................ 24,254 82,978 107,232\nPurchase obligations ........................................................................... 16,137 34,907 51,044\nPension cash obligations ..................................................................... 4,601 29,160 33,761\nTotal .................................................................................................... $ 73,440 $ 666,261 $ 739,701\nHistorically, we use more cash in the first half of the fiscal year, as we pay insurance premiums, taxes and incentive\ncompensation and build up inventory in preparation for the holiday/vacation season of our international operations. As outlined\nin the table above, we have approximately $73.4 million in material contractual cash obligations due within the next year, which\nincludes, among other things, scheduled debt repayments under the Facility, pension contributions, interest payments on our debt,\nand lease commitments. Our long-term debt obligations include the contractually scheduled principal repayment of our term loan\nand revolving loan borrowings under the Facility, which matures in 2027, and $300 million on our Senior Notes due in 2028.\nOperating and finance lease obligations consist of undiscounted lease payments due over the term of the lease. Expected interest\npayments are those associated with borrowings under the Facility and Senior Notes consistent with our contractually scheduled\nprincipal repayments. Our purchase obligations are for non-cancellable agreements primarily for raw material purchases and\ncapital expenditures. Our pension obligations include contributions and expected benefit payments to be paid by the Company\nrelated to certain defined benefit pension plans and exclude the expected benefit payments for two of our funded foreign defined\nbenefit plans as these obligations will be paid by the plans.\nBased on current interest rates and debt levels, we expect our aggregate interest expense for 2024 to be approximately $27\nmillion. We estimate aggregate capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately $42 million, although we are not committed to\nthis amount.\n34\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2023, we had $110.5 million in cash. Approximately $5.7 million of this cash was located in the U.S., and\nthe remaining $104.8 million was located outside of the U.S. The cash located outside of the U.S. is indefinitely reinvested in the\nrespective jurisdictions (except as identified below). We believe that our strategic plans and business needs, particularly for\nworking capital needs and capital expenditure requirements in Europe, Asia, and Australia, support our assertion that a portion of\nour cash in foreign locations will be reinvested and remittance will be postponed indefinitely. Of the $104.8 million of cash in\nforeign jurisdictions, approximately $51.9 million represents earnings which we have determined are not permanently reinvested,\nand as such we have provided for foreign withholding and U.S. state income taxes on these amounts in accordance with applicable\naccounting standards.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $121.7 million of borrowings outstanding under our Facility, all of which were term loan\nborrowings. There were no revolving loan borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, $1.6 million in letters\nof credit were outstanding under the Facility at the end of fiscal year 2023. As of December 31, 2023, we had additional borrowing\ncapacity of $298.4 million under the Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings\noutstanding under the Facility was 6.61%. As of December 31, 2023, there were no other lines of credit available to the Company.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2023, we had $300.0 million of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Senior Notes”)\noutstanding, which are discussed further below.\nIt is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. Our Facility matures in October of\n2027, and the Senior Notes, as discussed below, mature in December 2028. We cannot assure you that we will be able to\nrenegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or\nobtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and\nother liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes.\nIt is also important for you to consider that borrowings under our Facility comprise a substantial portion of our indebtedness,\nand that these borrowings are based on variable interest rates (as described below) that expose the Company to the risk that\ninterest rates may increase. For information regarding the current variable interest rates of these borrowings, the potential impact\non our interest expense from hypothetical increases in short term interest rates, and the former interest rate swap transaction,\nplease see the discussion in Item 7A of this Report.\nWe are not a party to any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nBalance Sheet\nAccounts receivable, net, were $163.4 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $182.8 million at January 1, 2023. The\ndecrease of $19.4 million was primarily due to customer collections in 2023, including the impact of delays in customer billings\nfrom the Cyber Event, in which the due dates for those delayed billings were pushed from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the first\nquarter of 2023.\nInventories, net, were $279.1 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $306.3 million at January 1, 2023. The decrease\nof $27.2 million was primarily due to decreases in the cost of raw materials during the current year, lower manufacturing volume\ndue to reduced customer demand, and improvements in working capital management.\n35\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities ............................................................... $ 142,034 $ 43,061 $ 86,689\nInvesting activities ................................................................. (19,514) (18,437) (28,071)\nFinancing activities ............................................................... (111,564) (19,490) (60,858)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash ...................................... 1,978 (4,822) (3,561)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents ...................................... 12,934 312 (5,801)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period ........................ 97,564 97,252 103,053\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period .................................. $ 110,498 $ 97,564 $ 97,252\nWe ended 2023 with $110.5 million in cash, an increase of $12.9 million during the year. The increase was primarily due to\nthe following:\n• Cash provided by operating activities was $142.0 million for 2023, which represents an increase of $99.0 million\ncompared to 2022. The increase in operating cash flows was primarily due to a greater source of cash from working\ncapital in 2023. Specifically, customer collections in 2023 contributed to a decrease in accounts receivable, primarily\nattributable to delays in customer billings from the Cyber Event, in which due dates for those delayed billings were\npushed from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023. The 2022 comparable period also included a greater\nuse of cash for working capital attributable to an increase in inventories compared with 2023.\n• Cash used in investing activities was $19.5 million for 2023, which represents an increase of $1.1 million compared to\n2022. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures due to increased capital investment,\npartially offset by the proceeds of approximately $6.6 million from the sale of the Company’s Thailand real estate in\n2023.\n• Cash used in financing activities was $111.6 million for 2023, which represents an increase of $92.1 million compared\nto 2022. The year-over-year difference was primarily due to lower revolving loan borrowings combined with higher\nrepayments of term loan borrowings in 2023 as a result of cash generated from operating activities as described above.\nFiscal year 2022 also included repurchases of the Company’s common stock that did not occur in 2023, which partially\noffset the increased use of cash for financing activities in 2023 compared with 2022.\nWe ended 2022 with $97.6 million in cash, an increase of $0.3 million during the year. The increase was primarily due to the\nfollowing:\n• Cash provided by operating activities was $43.1 million for 2022, which represents a decrease of $43.6 million compared\nto 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a greater use of cash for working capital during 2022. Specifically, higher\ninventories as a result of higher raw material costs and input costs contributed to the greater use of cash for working\ncapital in 2022. Higher variable compensation payouts in the first quarter of 2022 (related to 2021 performance) also\ncontributed to the increased use of cash for 2022. Cash provided by operating activities in 2022 also was negatively\nimpacted by delays in billings due to the Cyber Event, which pushed the due dates for those delayed billings from the\nfourth quarter of 2022 to the first quarter of 2023.\n• Cash used in investing activities was $18.4 million for 2022, which represents a decrease of $9.6 million compared to\n2021. The decrease was primarily due to reduced capital expenditures.\n36\n• Cash used in financing activities was $19.5 million for 2022, which represents a decrease of $41.4 million compared to\n2021. The year-over-year difference was primarily due to higher revolving loan borrowings in 2022 as a source of cash\nto fund operating activities as described above, offset by a use of cash for repurchases of the Company’s common stock\npursuant to a new share repurchase program adopted in the second quarter of 2022. Fiscal year 2021 also included higher\nrepayments of approximately $60 million of term loan borrowings which contributed to a greater use of cash in that\nperiod.\nWe ended 2021 with $97.3 million in cash, a decrease of $5.8 million during the year. The decrease was primarily due to the\nfollowing:\n• Cash provided by operating activities was $86.7 million for 2021, which represents a decrease of $32.4 million compared\nto 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a greater use of cash for working capital during 2021. Specifically, higher\naccounts receivable and inventories primarily attributable to increased customer demand in 2021 were partially offset\nby increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses that contributed positively to the change in working capital.\nLower variable compensation payouts in 2021 (related to 2020 performance) had a positive impact on cash provided by\noperating activities, partially offsetting the decrease from changes in working capital.\n• Cash used in investing activities was $28.1 million for 2021, which represents a decrease of $33.6 million from 2020.\nThe decrease was primarily due to lower capital expenditures compared to 2020 as two major capital projects were\nsubstantially completed in the prior year.\n• Cash used in financing activities was $60.9 million for 2021, which represents an increase of $18.1 million compared to\n2020. In 2021, we repaid approximately $60 million in term loan borrowings which contributed to the increase in cash\nused in financing activities (compared with 2020, when repayments on term loan borrowings were largely funded with\nthe proceeds from the issuance of the $300 million Senior Notes).\nShare Repurchases\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Company adopted a new share repurchase program in which the Company is authorized\nto repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The program has no specific expiration date. No\nshares of common stock were repurchased during 2023 pursuant to this program. During 2022, the Company repurchased and\nretired an aggregate of 1,383,682 shares at a weighted average price of $12.41 per share, or $17.2 million, pursuant to this\nprogram.\nAs of December 31, 2023, approximately $82.8 million remains authorized pursuant to this program for future share\nrepurchases. The program does not require the Company to repurchase a specific number or amount of shares, or to do so within\nany specific time periods.\nSyndicated Credit Facility\nIn the normal course of business, in addition to using our available cash, we fund our operations by borrowing under our\nFacility. At December 31, 2023, the Facility provided the Company and certain of its subsidiaries with a multicurrency revolving\nloan facility up to $300 million, as well as other U.S. denominated and multicurrency term loans. On October 14, 2022, in\nconnection with the fifth amendment to the Facility, the maturity date was extended to October 2027. Material terms under the\nFacility are discussed below. For additional information please see Note 9 entitled “Long-Term Debt” in Item 8 of this Report.\nInterest Rates and Fees\nUnder the Facility, interest on base rate loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from 0.25%\nto 2.00%, depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio (as defined in the Facility agreement) as of the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter. Interest on SOFR-based and alternative currency loans are charged at varying rates computed\nby applying a margin ranging from 1.25% to 3.00% over the applicable SOFR rate or alternative currency rate, depending on the\nCompany’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company pays a\ncommitment fee ranging from 0.20% to 0.40% per annum (depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the\nmost recently completed fiscal quarter) on the unused portion of the Facility.\n37\nFees for commercial letters of credit are computed as 1.00% per annum of the amount available to be drawn under such\nletters of credit. Fees for standby letters of credit are charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from 1.25%\nto 3.00% per annum of the amount available to be drawn under such standby letters of credit, depending on the Company’s\nconsolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.\nLIBOR Transition\nOn December 9, 2021 and October 14, 2022, we entered into the fourth and fifth amendments, respectively, to our Facility.\nThese amendments, among other changes, replaced the LIBOR benchmark rates with specified successor benchmark rates,\nincluding SOFR benchmark interest rates applicable to all loans denominated in U.S. dollars.\nCovenants\nThe Facility contains standard and customary covenants for agreements of this type, including various reporting, affirmative\nand negative covenants. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to:\n• create or incur liens on assets;\n• make acquisitions of or investments in businesses (in excess of certain specified amounts);\n• engage in any material line of business substantially different from the Company’s current lines of business;\n• incur indebtedness or contingent obligations;\n• sell or dispose of assets (in excess of certain specified amounts);\n• pay dividends or repurchase our stock (in excess of certain specified amounts);\n• repay other indebtedness prior to maturity unless we meet certain conditions; and\n• enter into sale and leaseback transactions.\nThe Facility also requires us to remain in compliance with the following financial covenants as of the end of each fiscal\nquarter, based on our consolidated results for the year then ended:\n• Consolidated Secured Net Leverage Ratio: Must be no greater than 3.00:1.00.\n• Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio: Must be no less than 2.25:1.00.\nEvents of Default\nIf we breach or fail to perform any of the affirmative or negative covenants under the Facility, or if other specified events\noccur (such as a bankruptcy or similar event or a change of control of Interface, Inc. or certain subsidiaries, or if we breach or fail\nto perform any covenant or agreement contained in any instrument relating to any of our other indebtedness exceeding $20\nmillion), after giving effect to any applicable notice and right to cure provisions, an event of default will exist. If an event of\ndefault exists and is continuing, the lenders’ Administrative Agent may, and upon the written request of a specified percentage of\nthe lender group shall:\n• declare all commitments of the lenders under the facility terminated;\n• declare all amounts outstanding or accrued thereunder immediately due and payable; and\n• exercise other rights and remedies available to them under the agreement and applicable law.\nCollateral\nPursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Security and Pledge Agreement, the Facility is secured by substantially all of\nthe assets of Interface, Inc. and our domestic subsidiaries (subject to exceptions for certain immaterial subsidiaries), including all\nof the stock of our domestic subsidiaries and up to 65% of the stock of our first-tier material foreign subsidiaries. If an event of\ndefault occurs under the Facility, the lenders’ Administrative Agent may, upon the request of a specified percentage of lenders,\nexercise remedies with respect to the collateral, including, in some instances, foreclosing mortgages on real estate assets, taking\npossession of or selling personal property assets, collecting accounts receivable, or exercising proxies to take control of the\npledged stock of domestic and first-tier material foreign subsidiaries.\nUnder the Facility, we are required to make quarterly amortization payments of the term loan borrowings. The amortization\npayments are due on the last day of the calendar quarter.\n38\nWe are in compliance with all covenants under the Facility and anticipate that we will remain in compliance with the\ncovenants for the foreseeable future.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had $300 million of Senior Notes outstanding. The Senior Notes bear an interest\nrate at 5.50% per annum and mature on December 1, 2028. Interest is paid semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\nDebt issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes are recorded as a reduction of long-term debt in the consolidated balance\nsheets and are amortized over the life of the outstanding debt.\nThe Senior Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Company’s material domestic\nsubsidiaries, all of which also guarantee the obligations of the Company under its Facility. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries\nand certain non-material domestic subsidiaries are considered non-guarantors. Net sales for the non-guarantor subsidiaries were\napproximately $584 million for fiscal year 2023, $597 million for fiscal year 2022, and $594 million for fiscal year 2021. Total\nindebtedness of the non-guarantor subsidiaries was approximately $133 million as of December 31, 2023. Included in this $133\nmillion is $103 million of indebtedness from the non-guarantor subsidiaries to guarantor subsidiaries, resulting from the dividend\nof an asset — a note receivable — by a non-guarantor subsidiary to a guarantor subsidiary. Total indebtedness of non-guarantor\nsubsidiaries was approximately $43 million as of January 1, 2023. There was no indebtedness from non-guarantor subsidiaries to\nguarantor subsidiaries as of January 1, 2023. The Senior Notes can be redeemed on or after December 1, 2023, at specified\nredemption prices. See Note 9 entitled “Long-Term Debt” in Item 8 of this Report for additional information.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe Company expects decreases in the cost of raw materials and freight to continue into fiscal year 2024, due to a stabilizing\nbut still challenging supply chain environment. We expect these impacts will benefit our gross profit margins in 2024. We\nanticipate that a continuing slow post COVID recovery in China, slow market conditions in the rest of Asia, and significant\nfinancial pressures in the commercial office market globally will adversely impact our future performance and demand for our\nproducts.\nCash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and\nsufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company’s cash flows from operations can be affected by\nnumerous factors including raw material availability and cost, demand for our products, and other factors described in “Risk\nFactors” included in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our\nconsolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management’s judgment, with\nfinancial reporting results relying on estimations about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Specific risks for these\ncritical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs. For all of these policies, management cautions that future\nevents may not develop as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at the asset group level whenever events\nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future\nundiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is indicated. A loss is then recognized for\nthe difference, if any, between the fair value of the asset (as estimated by management using its best judgment) and the carrying\nvalue of the asset. Management’s judgment in estimating the undiscounted cash flows based on market conditions and trends,\nand other industry specific metrics used in determining the fair value is subject to uncertainty. If actual market value is less\nfavorable than that estimated by management, additional write-downs may be required.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the\napplication of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards and are based on\nmanagement’s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income, as well as\nmanagement’s judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards. The carrying values of\nliabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management’s interpretations of applicable tax laws and incorporate\nmanagement’s assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions. The use of\ndifferent estimates, assumptions and judgments in connection with accounting for income taxes may result in materially different\ncarrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations.\n39\nWe evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from\nall sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning\nstrategies. These sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short-term and\nlong-term business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various\nprudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. To the extent we do not consider\nit more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. As of December 31, 2023,\nand January 1, 2023, we had state net operating loss carryforwards of $192.1 million and $162.8 million, respectively. Certain of\nthese state net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a valuation allowance because, based on the available evidence, we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. The remaining year-\nend 2023 amounts are expected to be fully recoverable within the applicable statutory expiration periods. If the actual amounts\nof taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.\nGoodwill. We review the carrying values of our goodwill annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year,\nor more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting may exceed its fair value as set\nforth in Accounting Standards Codification 350 “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other”, as amended by Accounting Standards\nUpdate (“ASU”) 2017-04. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an\noperating segment. We utilize the present value of expected future cash flows and the guideline public company method to\ndetermine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. The present value model requires management to estimate future cash\nflows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions we use to\nestimate future cash flows and the development of any forecasts to be used in the fair value determination are subject to inherent\nrisk and judgment. If we determine that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the\nreporting unit is not impaired. If we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, we\nmeasure the goodwill impairment charge based on the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value consistent\nwith ASU 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which we adopted on December 30, 2019.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing. We focused our testing\non the Americas reporting unit since it is the only reporting unit with an allocated goodwill balance. The allocated goodwill\nbalances for our EMEA and Asia Pacific reporting units were written off in prior years as a result of goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company performed limited procedures for our EMEA and Asia Pacific reporting units during the 2023 goodwill testing to\nfacilitate a reconciliation of market capitalization.\nThe annual quantitative goodwill testing performed in 2023 for our Americas reporting unit was consistent with our prior\nyear methodology. The Company prepared valuations for the Americas reporting unit on both a market comparable methodology\nand an income methodology, utilizing a combination of the present value of expected future cash flows and the guideline public\ncompany method to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. In preparing the valuation, past, present and future\nexpectations of performance were considered, including our expectations for the short-term and long-term impacts of\nmacroeconomic conditions, including inflation, and our expected financial performance, including planned revenue and operating\nincome for the Americas reporting unit. The present value model requires management to estimate future cash flows, the timing\nof these cash flows, and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate used for the Americas\nreporting unit was 11.5% in 2023 compared to 13.5% in 2022, which fluctuated based on a risk premium assigned to estimates\nof expected future performance. There is inherent uncertainty associated with key assumptions and estimates used in our\nimpairment testing, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions.\nAs a result of our 2023 annual goodwill testing, we determined that the fair value of our Americas reporting unit exceeded\nits carrying value by 71% at the 2023 measurement date, and therefore no impairment was indicated. The goodwill balance of\n$105.4 million at December 31, 2023, is allocated entirely to our Americas reporting unit.\nWe have not made any material changes to our goodwill impairment loss assessment methodology during the past three fiscal\nyears. Currently, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future assumptions or\nestimates we use to calculate impairment losses. However, we cannot predict or control market factors, including the impact of\nmacroeconomic conditions and the impact of certain risks inherent to our operations, as described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of\nthis Annual Report. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to additional\ngoodwill impairment losses that could be material.\n40\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed our annual goodwill quantitative testing. We considered factors such as, but\nnot limited to, our expectations for the short-term and long-term impacts of macroeconomic factors, including ongoing inflation,\nforeign currency exchange rates, and our expected financial performance, including planned revenue and operating income of\neach reporting unit. The discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from 13.5% to 14.0%, which primarily fluctuated based\non a country risk premium assigned to the geographical region of the reporting unit. For fiscal year 2022, we determined that the\ncarrying value of our EMEA reporting unit exceeded its fair value and that the associated goodwill was impaired. We recorded a\ngoodwill impairment charge of $29.4 million to write off all the goodwill allocated to our EMEA reporting unit as the excess of\ncarrying value over fair value was higher than the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit.\nAs of the 2022 measurement date, the fair value of our Americas reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 71%, and the\nAmericas reporting unit was not impaired. The Americas reporting unit had a goodwill balance of $102.4 million at the end of\nfiscal 2022. The goodwill balance allocated to our Asia-Pacific reporting unit was previously written off in connection with the\n2020 goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test consistent with prior years and the\nmethodology described above, and all reporting units that had a goodwill balance were noted to have a fair value that exceeded\ntheir carrying value.\nSee Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional\ninformation.\nInventories. We determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write down inventories\nfor the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less\nfavorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required.\nManagement’s judgment in estimating our reserves for inventory obsolescence is based on continuous examination of our\ninventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values. Experience has shown that\nsignificant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write-downs are the age of the inventory, the length of\nits product life cycles, anticipated demand for our products and current economic conditions. While we believe that adequate\nwrite-downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences\nmay continue to change, and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future. Our inventory reserve on\nDecember 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, was $34.0 million and $28.5 million, respectively. To the extent that actual obsolescence\nof our inventory differs from our estimate by 10%, our 2023 net income would be higher or lower by approximately $2.4 million,\non an after-tax basis.\n41\nPension Benefits. Net pension expense recorded is based on, among other things, assumptions about the discount rate,\nestimated return on plan assets and salary increases. While management believes these assumptions are reasonable, changes in\nthese and other factors and differences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of our\nplans above certain thresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year. The actuarial\nassumptions used in our salary continuation plan and our foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and\ncompared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation. The\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class.\nExpected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets,\nand include input from actuaries, investment service firms and investment managers. The table below represents the changes to\nthe projected benefit obligation as a result of changes in discount rate assumptions:\nIncrease (Decrease) in\nProjected Benefit\nForeign Defined Benefit Plans Obligation\n(in millions)\n1% increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate ........................................................................... $ (24.5)\n1% decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate .......................................................................... 30.4\nIncrease (Decrease) in\nProjected Benefit\nDomestic Salary Continuation Plan Obligation\n(in millions)\n1% increase in actuarial assumption for discount rate ........................................................................... $ (1.9)\n1% decrease in actuarial assumption for discount rate .......................................................................... 2.2\nAllowances for Expected Credit Losses. We maintain allowances for expected credit losses resulting from the inability of\ncustomers to make required payments. Estimating the amount of future expected losses requires us to consider historical losses\nfrom our customers, as well as current market conditions and future forecasts of our customers’ ability to make payments for\ngoods and services. By its nature, such an estimate is highly subjective, and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable\nthat we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated. Our allowance for expected credit losses on\nDecember 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, was $3.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively. To the extent the actual collectability\nof our accounts receivable differs from our estimates by 10%, our 2023 net income would be higher or lower by approximately\n$0.2 million, on an after-tax basis, depending on whether the actual collectability was better or worse, respectively, than the\nestimated allowance.\nProduct Warranties. We typically provide limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of our carpet products (for\nexample, warranties regarding excessive surface wear, edge ravel and static electricity) for periods ranging from ten to twenty\nyears, depending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which the product is to be installed. Similar limited\nwarranties are provided on certain attributes of our rubber and LVT products, typically for a period of 5 to 15 years. We typically\nwarrant that any services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion. In\nthe event of a breach of warranty, the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product.\nWe record a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and future expectations and periodically adjust\nthese provisions to reflect changes in actual experience. Our warranty and sales allowance reserve on December 31, 2023 and\nJanuary 1, 2023, was $4.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Actual warranty expense incurred could vary significantly from\namounts that we estimate. To the extent the actual warranty expense differs from our estimates by 10%, our 2023 net income\nwould be higher or lower by approximately $0.3 million, on an after-tax basis, depending on whether the actual expense is lower\nor higher, respectively, than the estimated provision.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 2 entitled “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Item 8 of this Report for discussion of these items.\n42\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nAs a result of the scope of our global operations, we are exposed to an element of market risk from changes in interest rates\nand foreign currency exchange rates. Our results of operations and financial condition could be impacted by this risk. We manage\nour exposure to market risk through our regular operating and financial activities and, to the extent we deem appropriate, through\nthe use of derivative financial instruments.\nFrom time to time, we employ derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading\npurposes. We monitor the use of derivative financial instruments through objective measurable systems, well-defined market and\ncredit risk limits, and timely reports to senior management according to prescribed guidelines. We have established strict counter-\nparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions with a rating of investment grade or better. As a\nresult, we consider the risk of counter-party default to be minimal. There were no active derivative instruments as of December 31,\n2023.\nInterest Rate Market Risk Exposure\nChanges in interest rates affect the interest paid on our variable rate debt. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest\nrates, our management monitors interest rates and has developed and implemented a policy to maintain the percentage of fixed\nand variable rate debt within certain parameters, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. In addition, from time to time,\nwe may enter into derivative transactions, such as interest rate swaps, in order to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\nThere were no active interest rate derivative instruments as of December 31, 2023.\nForeign Currency Exchange Market Risk Exposure\nA significant portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions. We manufacture\nour products in the United States, Northern Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, China, and Australia, and we sell our products in\nmore than 100 countries. As a result, our financial results have been, and could be, significantly affected by factors such as\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our\nproducts. Our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and many other currencies,\nincluding the Euro, British Pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Chinese Renminbi. When the U.S. dollar\nstrengthens against a foreign currency, the value of anticipated sales in those currencies decreases, and vice versa. Additionally,\nto the extent our foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar transact business in countries other than\nthe United States, exchange rate changes between two foreign currencies could ultimately impact us. Finally, because we report\nin U.S. dollars on a consolidated basis, foreign currency exchange fluctuations could have a translation impact on our financial\nposition. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into derivative transactions from\ntime to time, such as forward contracts and foreign currency options. There were no active foreign currency derivative instruments\nas of December 31, 2023.\nDuring 2023, we recognized a $19.2 million decrease in our accumulated other comprehensive loss – foreign currency\ntranslation adjustment account compared with January 1, 2023, primarily due to the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S.\ndollar in 2023, partially offset by the weakening of the Australian dollar and Chinese Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.\nSensitivity Analysis\nFor purposes of specific risk analysis, we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the fair\nvalues of our market-sensitive instruments.\nTo perform sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values associated with the impact of hypothetical changes\nin interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market-sensitive instruments. The market value of instruments affected\nby interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk is computed based on the present value of future cash flows as impacted\nby the changes in the rates attributable to the market risk being measured. The discount rates used for the present value\ncomputations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2023. The\nvalues that result from these computations are then compared with the market values of the financial instruments. The differences\nare the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk.\n43\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs discussed above, our Facility is comprised of a combination of term loan and revolving loan borrowings. The following\ntable summarizes our market risks associated with our variable rate debt obligations under the Facility and fixed rate Senior Notes\ndebt as of December 31, 2023. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by year of maturity.\nRate-Sensitive Liabilities 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Total Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nLong-term Debt:\nVariable Rate .......................... $ 8,572 $ 8,572 $ 8,572 $ 95,942 $ — $ 121,658 $ 121,658\nFixed Rate .............................. — — — — 300,000 300,000 281,991\nOur weighted average interest rate for our outstanding borrowings under the Facility as of December 31, 2023 and January 1,\n2023 was 6.61% and 5.78%, respectively.\nAn increase in our effective interest rate of 1% on our variable rate debt would increase annual interest expense by\napproximately $1.2 million. We will continue to review our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and evaluate whether we should\ncontinue to manage such exposures through any future interest rate swap transactions. The carrying value of the Company’s\nborrowings under our Facility approximates fair value as the Facility bears variable interest rates that are similar to existing\nmarket rates. Based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant,\nthe fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of $11.6 million. Conversely, a 100-basis\npoint decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt of $12.2 million.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2023, a 10% decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar,\nwith all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our short-term financial instruments (primarily\ncash, accounts receivable and accounts payable) of approximately $12.1 million or an increase in the fair value of our financial\ninstruments of approximately $14.8 million, respectively. As the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net\nforeign investments is not included in the sensitivity model, these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign\ncurrency exchange risk.\n44\nITEM 8.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations\nInterface is a global flooring company specializing in carbon neutral carpet tile and resilient flooring, including luxury vinyl\ntile (“LVT”), and nora® rubber flooring. The Company manufactures modular carpet focusing on the high quality, designer-\noriented sector of the market, sources resilient flooring including LVT from third parties and focuses on the same sector of the\nmarket, and provides specialized carpet replacement, installation and maintenance services. The Company also manufactures and\nsells resilient rubber flooring.\nThe Company has determined that it has two operating and reportable segments – namely Americas (“AMS”) which includes\nthe United States, Canada and Latin America geographic areas, and Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia (collectively “EAAA”).\nSee Note 20 entitled “Segment Information” for additional information.\nCybersecurity Event\nOn November 20, 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT\nsystems (the “Cyber Event”). In response to this Cyber Event, we notified law enforcement and took steps to supplement existing\nsecurity monitoring, including scanning and protective measures. The investigation of the Cyber Event was completed during\n2023.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All of our subsidiaries are\nwholly-owned, and we are not a party to any joint venture, partnership or other variable interest entity that would potentially\nqualify for consolidation. All material intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during\nthe reporting periods. Examples include provisions for returns, bad debts, product claims reserves, inventory obsolescence and\nthe length of product life cycles, accruals associated with restructuring activities, income tax exposures and valuation allowances,\nand the carrying value of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Actual results could vary from these\nestimates.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nGlobal economic challenges, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, inflation, supply chain\ndisruptions, and the slow post COVID-19 recovery in China could cause economic uncertainty and volatility. In connection with\nthe Cyber Event discussed above, security breaches may expose us to fines and other liabilities to the extent sensitive data stored\nin our IT systems, including data related to customers, suppliers or employees, are misappropriated. Any potential fine or other\nliability is not probable nor estimable at this time. The Company considered these impacts and subsequent general uncertainties\nand volatility in the global economy on the assumptions and estimates used herein, including the goodwill and intangible asset\nassessments and impairments discussed in Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” These uncertainties could\nresult in a future material adverse effect to the Company’s financial statements if actual results differ from these estimates.\n49\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount\nthat reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve this\ncore principle, the guidance provides that an entity should apply the following steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer;\n(2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to\nthe performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nRevenue Recognized from Contracts with Customers\nContracts with customers typically take the form of invoices for purchase of materials from the Company. Customer payment\nterms vary by region and are typically less than 60 days. The performance obligation is the delivery of these materials to the\ncustomer’s control. Revenue from the sale of modular carpet, resilient flooring, rubber flooring, and related products (TacTiles\ninstallation materials, etc.) was approximately 98% of the Company’s total revenue in 2023, approximately 97% of the Company’s\ntotal revenue in 2022, and approximately 98% of the Company’s total revenue in 2021. The revenue from sales of these products\nis recognized upon shipment, or in certain cases, upon delivery to the customer. The transaction price for these sales is readily\nidentifiable. The remaining revenue of approximately 2% for 2023, approximately 3% for 2022, and approximately 2% for 2021\nwas generated from the installation of carpet and other flooring-related material.\nFor installation projects underway, the Company recognized installation revenue over time based on a project cost input\nmethod as the customer simultaneously received and consumed the benefit of the services. The installation of the carpet and\nrelated products is a separate performance obligation from the sale of carpet. The majority of these projects are completed within\nfive days of the start of installation. The transaction price for these sale and installation contracts is readily determinable between\nflooring material and installation services and typically is specifically identified in the contract with the customer.\nThe Company has utilized the portfolio approach to its contracts with customers, as its contracts with customers have similar\ncharacteristics, and it is reasonable to expect that the effects from applying this approach are not materially different from applying\nthe accounting standard to individual contracts.\nThe Company does not have any other significant revenue streams outside of these sales of flooring material, and the sale\nand installation of flooring material, as described above.\nThe Company does not record taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities within revenues. The\nCompany records such taxes collected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets.\nPerformance Obligations\nAs noted above, the Company primarily generates revenue through the sale of flooring material to end users either upon\nshipment or upon arrival of the product at its destination. In these instances, there typically is no other obligation to the customers\nother than the delivery of flooring material, with the exception of warranty. The Company does offer a warranty to its customers\nwhich guarantees certain on-floor performance characteristics and warrants against manufacturing defects. The warranty is not a\nservice warranty, and there is no ability to separate the warranty obligation from the sale of the flooring or purchase it\nseparately. The Company’s incidence of warranty claims is extremely low, with less than 0.5% of revenue in claims on an annual\nbasis for the last three fiscal years. Given the nature of the warranty as well as the financial impact, the Company has determined\nthat there is no need to identify this warranty as a separate performance obligation, and the Company accounts for warranty on\nan accrual basis.\n50\nFor the Company’s installation business, the sales of carpet and other flooring materials and installation services are separate\ndeliverables which under the revenue recognition requirements should be characterized as separate performance obligations. The\nnature of the installation projects is such that the vast majority – an amount in excess of 85% of these installation projects – are\ncompleted in less than five days. The Company’s largest installation customers are retail, education and corporate customers, and\nthese are on a project-by-project basis and are short-term installations. The Company has evaluated these projects at the end of\neach reporting period and recorded revenue in accordance with the accounting standards for projects which were underway as of\nthe end of 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nCosts to Obtain Contracts\nThe Company pays sales commissions to many of its sales personnel based upon their selling activity. These are direct costs\nassociated with obtaining the contracts and are expensed as the revenue is earned. As these commissions become payable upon\nshipment (or in certain cases delivery) of product, the commission is earned as the revenue is recognized. There are no other\nmaterial costs the Company incurs as part of obtaining the sales contract.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nShipping and handling costs incurred are classified in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAdvertising and Promotion\nThe Company’s advertising and promotional activities primarily consist of product samples, printed materials, digital\nmarketing, trade shows, and customer events. Advertising and promotional costs are expensed when the advertising / promotional\nactivity first takes place. Advertising and promotional expenses were $34.6 million, $31.3 million and $28.4 million for the years\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were recorded in selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in SG&A expenses and cost of sales in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Research and development expense includes costs associated with the development of new\nproducts as well as the improvement and enhancement of existing products. Research and development expense was $17.0\nmillion, $19.1 million, and $19.3 million for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments\nHighly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nInvestments with maturities greater than three months and less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Significant\nconcentrations of credit risk may arise from the Company’s cash maintained at various banks, as from time to time cash balances\nmay exceed the FDIC limits. The Company did not hold any significant amounts of cash equivalents and short-term investments\nat December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nCash payments for interest amounted to approximately $28.8 million, $25.1 million, and $22.9 million for the years 2023,\n2022 and 2021, respectively. Income tax payments amounted to approximately $25.8 million, $31.4 million and $23.1 million for\nthe years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company received income tax refunds\nof $2.5 million, $12.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively.\nAllowances for Expected Credit Losses\nThe Company maintains allowances for expected credit losses for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers\nto make required payments. Estimating the amount of future expected losses requires the Company to consider historical losses\nfrom our customers, as well as current market conditions and future forecasts of our customers’ ability to make payments for\ngoods and services. By its nature, such an estimate is highly subjective, and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable\nthat the Company is unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated.\n51\nInventories\nInventories are carried at the lower of cost (standards approximating the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.\nCosts included in inventories are based on invoiced costs and/or production costs, as applicable. Included in production costs are\nmaterial, direct labor and allocated overhead. The Company writes down inventories for the difference between the carrying value\nof the inventories and their estimated net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by\nmanagement, additional write-downs may be required.\nManagement estimates its reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining its inventories to determine if\nthere are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values. Experience has shown that significant indicators that could\nrequire the need for additional inventory write-downs are the age of the inventory, the length of its product life cycles, anticipated\ndemand for the Company’s products, and current economic conditions. While management believes that adequate write-downs\nfor inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements, consumer tastes and preferences may\ncontinue to change, and the Company could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future.\nLeases\nThe Company records a right-of-use asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases once a contract that contains a\nlease is executed and the Company has the right to control the use of the leased asset. The right-of-use asset is measured as the\npresent value of the lease obligation. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of the lease liability is the Company’s\nincremental borrowing rate, which is based on the estimated rate for a fully collateralized borrowing that fully amortizes over a\nsimilar lease term at the commencement date and for the applicable geographical region.\nThe Company made an accounting policy election to exclude leases with an initial term of 12 months or less from the\ncalculation of the right-of-use asset and lease liability recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. These leases primarily\nrepresent month-to-month operating leases for equipment where we were reasonably certain that we would not elect an option to\nextend the lease. The Company also made an accounting policy election not to separate lease and non-lease components for all\nasset classes and accounts for the lease payments as a single component.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Long-Lived Assets\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the following\nestimated useful lives: buildings and improvements – ten to forty years; equipment, furniture and fixtures – three to twelve years;\nand computer software – three to six years. Certain manufacturing equipment in our Weinheim manufacturing facility have\nestimated useful lives up to twenty-five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the asset life or lease\nterm, generally between three to twelve years. Interest costs for the construction/development of certain long-term assets are\ncapitalized and amortized over the related assets’ estimated useful lives. Total depreciation expense amounted to approximately\n$35.9 million, $36.3 million, and $41.9 million for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the\nasset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset. Repair and maintenance costs\nare charged to operating expense as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually and between\nannual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit\nbelow its carrying amount. During the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed the annual goodwill\nimpairment test. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below an\noperating segment. In performing the impairment testing, the Company prepared valuations of reporting units on both a market\ncomparable methodology and an income methodology, and those valuations were compared with the respective carrying values\nof the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment existed. In preparing the valuations, past, present and future\nexpectations of performance were considered. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for additional\ninformation.\n52\nTrademark and trade name intangible assets acquired in connection with the nora acquisition are not subject to amortization,\nbut are tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more\nlikely than not reduce the fair value of the intangible asset below its carrying amount. For the annual tests performed in 2023,\n2022, and 2021, the Company prepared valuations of the intangible assets using the present value of cash flows under the relief\nfrom royalty method, which were compared to the carrying value of intangible assets to determine whether any impairment\nexisted. See Note 12 entitled “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for additional information.\nThe Company’s other intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology that is amortized on a straight-line basis\nover the estimated useful life of 7 years.\nProduct Warranties\nThe Company typically provides limited warranties with respect to certain attributes of its carpet products (for example,\nwarranties regarding excessive surface wear, edge ravel and static electricity) for periods ranging from ten to twenty years,\ndepending on the particular carpet product and the environment in which it is to be installed. Similar limited warranties are\nprovided on certain attributes of its rubber and LVT products, typically for a period of 5 to 15 years. The Company typically\nwarrants that services performed will be free from defects in workmanship for a period of one year following completion. In the\nevent of a breach of warranty, the remedy typically is limited to repair of the problem or replacement of the affected product.\nThe Company records a provision related to warranty costs based on historical experience and future expectations and\nperiodically adjusts these provisions to reflect changes in actual experience. Warranty and sales allowance reserves amounted to\n$4.3 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively, and are included in accrued expenses\nin the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s financial\nstatements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, the Company generally considers all expected future events other\nthan enactments of changes in tax laws or rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates will be\nrecognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company has elected to account for tax effects of the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) in the period when\nincurred, and therefore has not provided any deferred tax impacts for these provisions in its consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion\nor all of the deferred tax assets will expire before realization of the benefit or that future deductibility is not probable. The ultimate\nrealization of the deferred tax assets depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in\nthe future. This requires us to use estimates and make assumptions regarding significant future events such as the taxability of\nentities operating in the various taxing jurisdictions.\nFor uncertain tax positions, the Company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance, which requires application\nof a “more likely than not” threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions. The Company’s ongoing assessments\nof the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can\nincrease or decrease the Company’s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results. For further information, see Note 17\nentitled “Income Taxes.”\nFair Values of Financial Instruments\nFair values of cash and cash equivalents and short-term debt approximate cost due to the short period of time to maturity.\nFair values of debt are based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates and classified as level 2 within\nthe fair value hierarchy. See Note 5 entitled “Fair Value of Financial Instruments” for further information.\n53\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies\nThe financial position and results of operations of most of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using local\ncurrencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange\nrate in effect at each year-end. Income and expense items are translated each month at average monthly exchange rates throughout\nthe year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account. In the event\nof a divestiture or substantial liquidation of a foreign subsidiary, the related foreign currency translation results are reclassified\nfrom equity to income. Foreign exchange translation gains (losses) were $19.2 million, $(38.3) million, and $(40.1) million for\nthe years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the average number of common shares outstanding, including participating\nsecurities. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential increase in average common shares outstanding that would result from\nshare-based awards or the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, calculated using the treasury stock method. See Note\n15 entitled “Earnings Per Share” for additional information.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company has share-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 14 entitled\n“Shareholders' Equity.”\nThe Company recognizes expense related to its restricted stock, restricted share unit and performance share grants based on\nthe grant date fair value of the shares awarded, as determined by its market price at date of grant.\nPension Benefits\nNet pension expense recorded is based on, among other things, assumptions about the discount rate, estimated return on plan\nassets and salary increases. While the Company believes these assumptions are reasonable, changes in these and other factors and\ndifferences between actual and assumed changes in the present value of liabilities or assets of the Company’s plans above certain\nthresholds could cause net annual expense to increase or decrease materially from year to year. The actuarial assumptions used\nin the Company’s salary continuation plan and foreign defined benefit plans reporting are reviewed periodically and compared\nwith external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligation. The expected long-\nterm rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on weighted average expected returns for each asset class. Expected returns\nreflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets, and include input\nfrom actuaries, investment service firms and investment managers.\nReclassifications\nPrior period amounts for goodwill and intangible assets, net, in the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to\nconform with the current period presentation. Additionally, prior period amounts for the major classes of assets representing\nproperty, plant and equipment, as disclosed in Note 7 entitled “Property, Plant and Equipment,” have been reclassified to conform\nwith the current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on total assets as previously reported.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53 week period ending on the Sunday nearest December 31. All references herein to\n“2023,” “2022,” and “2021,” mean the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, respectively.\nFiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 were each comprised of 52 weeks.\n54\nNOTE 2 – RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements – Adopted\nIn July 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-03,\n“Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205), Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220),\nDistinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480), Equity (Topic 505), Compensation — Stock Compensation (Topic 718).” This\nASU amends various paragraphs in the accounting codification pursuant to the issuance of Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin\n(“SAB”) number 120. The ASU provides clarifying guidance related to employee and non-employee share-based payment\naccounting, including guidance related to spring-loaded awards. ASU 2023-03 was effective upon issuance. The adoption of this\nASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity\nSecurities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions.” This ASU clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity\nsecurity is not considered in measuring fair value. The ASU also requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to\ncontractual sale restrictions. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning\nafter December 15, 2023. Early adoption was permitted. The Company adopted this standard on April 2, 2023. The adoption of\nthis standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements – Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”\nThis ASU requires public entities on an annual basis to disclose a rate reconciliation with explicit categories, as outlined in the\nASU, and requires additional disclosures for reconciling items that meet certain quantitative thresholds. Other disclosures include\ndisaggregation of income taxes paid, pre-tax income, and income tax expense. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU to\nits income tax disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment\nDisclosures.” This ASU requires additional disclosures in annual and interim periods for significant segment expenses included\nin the measure of segment profit provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Disclosure of other segment items\nby reportable segment as well as a description of its composition is also required. The new guidance is effective for annual periods\nbeginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU to its segment disclosures.\n55\nNOTE 3 – REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company generates revenue from sales of modular carpet, resilient flooring, rubber flooring, and other flooring-related\nmaterial, and from the installation of carpet and other flooring-related material. A summary of these revenue streams, as a\npercentage of net sales, for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is a follows:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\nRevenue from the sale of flooring material .................................. 98 % 97 % 98 %\nRevenue from installation of flooring material............................. 2 % 3 % 2 %\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nFor fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue from the Company’s customers is broken down by geography as follows:\nFiscal Year\nGeography 2023 2022 2021\nAmericas ....................................................................................... 58.4 % 58.0 % 54.3 %\nEurope .......................................................................................... 30.1 % 29.2 % 31.7 %\nAsia-Pacific .................................................................................. 11.5 % 12.8 % 14.0 %\nRevenue from the Company’s customers in the Americas corresponds to the AMS reportable segment, and the EAAA\nreportable segment includes revenue from the Europe and Asia-Pacific geographies. See Note 20 entitled “Segment Information”\nfor additional information.\n56\nNOTE 4 – RECEIVABLES\nThe Company has adopted credit policies and standards intended to reduce the inherent risk associated with potential\nincreases in its concentration of credit risk due to increasing trade receivables. Management believes that credit risks are further\nmoderated by the diversity of its end customers and geographic sales areas. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations\nof its customers’ financial condition and requires collateral as deemed necessary. The Company maintains allowances for expected\ncredit losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of its customers were\nto deteriorate, resulting in a change in their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. As of December 31,\n2023, and January 1, 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses amounted to $3.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for\nall accounts receivable of the Company.\n57\nNOTE 5 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nAccounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure\nestimated fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities (level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of the\nfair value hierarchy under applicable accounting standards are described below:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted\nassets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 Inputs to the valuation methodology include:\n• quoted prices for similar assets in active markets;\n• quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets;\n• inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset; and\n• inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by observable data by correlation or other.\nLevel 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.\nA financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to\nthe fair value measurement.\nThe following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values, including the level within the fair value hierarchy,\nof certain financial instruments:\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nCarrying Fair Value Fair Value Carrying Fair Value Fair Value\nValue (Level 1) (Level 2) Value (Level 1) (Level 2)\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nCompany-owned life insurance .................. $ 22,788 $ — $ 22,788 $ 22,616 $ — $ 22,616\nDeferred compensation investments ........... 28,417 9,200 19,217 27,610 11,003 16,607\nLiabilities(1):\nBorrowings under Syndicated Credit\nFacility(2) .................................................. $ 121,658 $ — $ 121,658 $ 226,332 $ — $ 226,332\n5.50% Senior Notes due 2028(3).................. 300,000 — 281,991 300,000 — 248,652\n(1) Carrying values are presented gross, excluding the impact of unamortized debt issuance costs and including amounts presented\nas current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with term loan borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility, recorded as a\nreduction of long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets, were $1.0 million and $1.9 million as of December 31, 2023 and\nJanuary 1, 2023, respectively.\n(3) Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Senior Notes, recorded as a reduction of long-term debt in the\nconsolidated balance sheets, were $3.4 million and $4.2 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively.\nCompany-Owned Life Insurance\nThe fair value of Company-owned life insurance is measured on a readily determinable cash surrender value on a recurring\nbasis. Company-owned life insurance is recorded at fair value within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in\nthe fair value of Company-owned life insurance are recognized in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n58\nDeferred Compensation Investments\nAssets associated with the Company’s nonqualified savings plans are held in a rabbi trust and consist of investments in\nmutual funds and insurance contracts. The fair value of the mutual funds is derived from quoted prices in active markets. The fair\nvalue of the insurance contracts is based on observable inputs related to the performance measurement funds that shadow the\ndeferral investment allocations made by participants in the nonqualified savings plans. These investments are recorded at fair\nvalue within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of the investments associated with the\nnonqualified savings plans are recognized in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. See Note 19 entitled\n“Employee Benefit Plans” for additional information on the Company’s nonqualified savings plans.\nSyndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes\nThe Company’s liabilities for borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility (the “Facility”) and 5.50% Senior Notes due\n2028 (the “Senior Notes”) are not recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value of borrowings\nunder the Facility approximates fair value as the Facility bears variable interest rates that are similar to existing market rates. The\nfair value of the Senior Notes is derived using quoted prices for similar instruments.\nOther Assets and Liabilities\nDue to the short maturity of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, their\ncarrying values approximate fair value. See Note 19 entitled “Employee Benefit Plans” for additional information on defined\nbenefit plan assets.\n59\nNOTE 6 – INVENTORIES\nInventories are summarized as follows:\nEnd of Fiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nFinished goods ........................................................................................................ $ 201,821 $ 209,478\nWork-in-process ..................................................................................................... 20,892 15,463\nRaw materials ......................................................................................................... 56,366 81,386\nInventories, net ....................................................................................................... $ 279,079 $ 306,327\nReserves for inventory obsolescence amounted to $34.0 million and $28.5 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1,\n2023, respectively, and have been netted against amounts presented above.\n60\nNOTE 7 – PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following:\nEnd of Fiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nLand ........................................................................................................................ $ 15,810 $ 16,307\nBuildings and improvements .................................................................................. 162,359 169,370\nEquipment, furniture and fixtures(1) ........................................................................ 533,418 511,916\nComputer software ................................................................................................. 66,792 66,826\nConstruction-in-progress(2) ..................................................................................... 21,577 24,066\n799,956 788,485\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization(3) .......................................................

At December 31, 2023, the Facility provided to\nthe Company and certain of its subsidiaries a multicurrency revolving loan facility up to $300.0 million, as well as other U.S.\ndenominated and multicurrency term loans. At December 31, 2023, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $298.4\nmillion under the revolving loan facility.\nSignificant Facility Amendments\nOn December 9, 2021, the Company entered into a fourth amendment to its Facility. The fourth amendment provided for,\namong other changes, the following amendments to the Facility, which became effective on December 16, 2021:\n• amendments to replace the LIBOR interest rate benchmark applicable to loans and other extensions of credit under the\nFacility denominated in British Pounds sterling and Euros with specified successor benchmark rates;\n• the amendment of certain provisions related to the implementation, use and administration of successor benchmark rates\nand to set forth certain borrowing requirements; and\n• amendments to provide for the case where any interest rate benchmark in the future ceases to be available.\nOn October 14, 2022, the Company entered into a fifth amendment to its Facility. The fifth amendment provided for, among\nother changes, the following amendments to the Facility:\n• the amendment of the maturity date of the Facility to October 2027; and\n• amendments to replace the LIBOR benchmark interest rates applicable to all loans denominated in U.S. dollars with the\nSOFR benchmark interest rates.\n63\nIn connection with the fifth amendment, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.1 million within\ninterest expense in the consolidated statement of operations and recorded approximately $1.0 million of debt issuance costs. Of\nthis amount, approximately $0.4 million of debt issuance costs associated with term loan borrowings was recorded as a reduction\nof long-term debt, and approximately $0.7 million of debt issuance costs associated with revolving loan borrowings was recorded\nin other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest Rates and Fees\nInterest on base rate loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin ranging from 0.25% to 2.00%,\ndepending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter.

These fees are amortized straight-line, which approximates\nthe effective interest method, and over the life of the outstanding borrowing, the debt balance will increase by the same amount\nas the fees that are amortized. As of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the unamortized debt issuance costs recorded as a\nreduction of long-term debt were $4.4 million and $6.1 million, respectively. Expenses related to such costs for the years 2023,\n2022 and 2021 amounted to $1.7 million, $1.2 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.\nDebt issuance costs related to the issuance of revolving debt, which include underwriting, legal and other direct costs, net of\naccumulated amortization, were $1.4 million and $1.8 million, as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. These\namounts are included in other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company amortizes these costs over the\nlife of the related debt. Expenses related to such costs amounted to $0.4 million for each of the years 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nFuture Maturities\nThe aggregate maturities of borrowings for each of the five fiscal years subsequent to 2023 are as follows:\nFiscal Year Amount\n(in thousands)\n2024 ......................................................................................................................................................... $ 8,572\n2025 ......................................................................................................................................................... 8,572\n2026 ......................................................................................................................................................... 8,572\n2027 ......................................................................................................................................................... 95,942\n2028 ......................................................................................................................................................... 300,000\nTotal debt ................................................................................................................................................. $ 421,658\nTotal long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets includes a reduction for unamortized debt issuance costs of $4.4\nmillion which are excluded from the maturities table above.\n66\nNOTE 10 – DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into interest rate swap transactions to fix the variable interest rate on a portion of its\nterm loan borrowing in order to manage a portion of its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Company’s objective and\nstrategy with respect to these interest rate swaps is to protect the Company against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing\nits exposure to variability to cash flows relating to interest payments on a portion of its outstanding debt.\nCash Flow Interest Rate Swaps\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company terminated its designated interest rate swap transactions with a total notional\nvalue of $250 million. Hedge accounting was also discontinued at that time. Losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive\nloss for these terminated interest rate swaps are reclassified and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations to the extent\nit is probable that a portion of the original forecasted transactions related to the portion of the hedged debt repaid will not occur\nby the end of the originally specified time period. See Note 21 entitled “Items Reclassified From Accumulated Other\nComprehensive Loss” for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2023, all amounts related to the terminated interest rate swaps have been recognized in the consolidated\nstatements of operations, and there was no remaining balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the\nterminated interest rate swaps. As of January 1, 2023, the remaining accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the\nterminated interest rate swaps to be amortized to earnings over the remaining term of the interest rate swaps prior to termination,\nbefore tax, was $1.0 million.\n67\nNOTE 11 – LEASES\nGeneral\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for manufacturing equipment, corporate offices, showrooms, distribution\nfacilities, design centers, as well as computer and office equipment. The Company’s leases have terms ranging from 1 to 20 years,\nsome of which may include options to extend the lease term for up to 5 years, and certain leases may include an option to terminate\nthe lease. Our lease accounting may include these options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will\nexercise that option.\nAs of December 31, 2023, there were no significant leases that had not commenced.\nThe table below represents a summary of the balances recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the Company’s\nleases as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023:\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nOperating Finance Operating Finance\nBalance Sheet Location Leases Leases Leases Leases\n(in thousands)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets ................................ $ 87,519 $ 81,644\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities ................. $ 12,347 $ 11,857\nOperating lease liabilities .............................................. 78,269 72,305\nTotal operating lease liabilities ................................... $ 90,616 $ 84,162\nProperty, plant and equipment, net ................................ $ 7,236 $ 5,845\nAccrued expenses .......................................................... $ 2,587 $ 2,101\nOther long-term liabilities ............................................. 5,035 4,138\nTotal finance lease liabilities ....................................... $ 7,622 $ 6,239\nLease Costs\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets ............................................. $ 2,808 $ 2,238 $ 2,653\nInterest on lease liabilities ........................................................... 319 164 140\nOperating lease cost ......................................................................... 18,850 18,916 21,581\nShort-term lease cost ........................................................................ 1,143 849 977\nVariable lease cost ............................................................................ 2,509 2,692 2,831\nTotal lease cost ................................................................................... $ 25,629 $ 24,859 $ 28,182\n68\nOther Supplemental Information\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities:\nOperating cash flows from finance leases ........................................ $ 237 $ 128 $ 108\nOperating cash flows from operating leases .................................... 15,552 18,080 22,210\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases ........................................ 2,419 2,089 2,282\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease\nliabilities ......................................................................................... 3,612 3,436 3,259\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease\nliabilities ......................................................................................... 15,561 9,307 13,330\nLease Term and Discount Rate\nThe table below presents the weighted average remaining lease terms and discount rates for finance and operating leases as\nof December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023:\nEnd of Fiscal Year\n2023 2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term – finance leases (in years)....................... 3.70 3.82\nWeighted-average remaining lease term – operating leases (in years) ................... 8.29 9.29\nWeighted-average discount rate – finance leases .................................................... 5.51 % 3.79 %\nWeighted-average discount rate – operating leases ................................................ 6.25 % 5.89 %\nMaturity Analysis\nA maturity analysis of lease payments under non-cancellable leases is presented as follows:\nFiscal Year Operating Leases Finance Leases\n(in thousands)\n2024 ........................................................................................................................ $ 16,955 $ 2,921\n2025 ........................................................................................................................ 16,287 2,111\n2026 ........................................................................................................................ 16,196 1,545\n2027 ........................................................................................................................ 13,417 1,105\n2028 ........................................................................................................................ 10,930 570\nThereafter ............................................................................................................... 43,725 244\nTotal future minimum lease payments (undiscounted) ........................................... 117,510 8,496\nLess: Present value discount ...................................................................................

See Note 20 entitled “Segment\nInformation” for additional information. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level.\nThe Company’s reporting units consist of (1) the Americas, (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and (3) Asia-Pacific.\nThe Americas reporting unit is the same as the AMS reportable segment, and the EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units are one\nlevel below the EAAA reportable segment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing. We focused our testing\non the Americas reporting unit since it is the only reporting unit with an allocated goodwill balance. The allocated goodwill\nbalances for our EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units were written off in prior years as a result of goodwill impairment charges.\nThe Company performed limited procedures for our EMEA and Asia-Pacific reporting units during the 2023 goodwill testing to\nfacilitate a reconciliation of market capitalization.\nThe annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing performed in 2023 for our Americas reporting unit was consistent with\nour prior year methodology. The Company prepared valuations for the Americas reporting unit on both a market comparable\nmethodology and an income methodology, utilizing a combination of the present value of expected future cash flows and the\nguideline public company method to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. In preparing the valuation, past,\npresent and future expectations of performance were considered, including our expectations for the short-term and long-term\nimpacts of macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, and our expected financial performance, including planned revenue\nand operating income for the Americas reporting unit. The present value model requires management to estimate future cash\nflows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate used for\nthe Americas reporting unit was 11.5% in 2023 compared to 13.5% in 2022, which fluctuated based on a risk premium assigned\nto estimates of expected future performance. There is inherent uncertainty associated with key assumptions and estimates used in\nour impairment testing, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions.\nAs a result of our 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing, we determined that the fair value of our Americas reporting unit\nexceeded its carrying value by 71% at the 2023 measurement date, and therefore no impairment was indicated. The goodwill\nbalance of $105.4 million at December 31, 2023 is allocated to our Americas reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test, consistent with prior years.\nThe Company performed this test at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment or one level below the operating\nsegment level. In performing the impairment testing for each reporting unit, the Company prepared valuations of reporting units\non both a market comparable methodology and an income methodology, and those valuations were compared with the respective\ncarrying values of the reporting units to determine whether any goodwill impairment existed. In preparing the valuations, past,\npresent and future expectations of performance were considered, including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in\n2022. As a result of our 2022 testing, we determined that the carrying value of our EMEA reporting unit exceeded its fair value\nand that the associated goodwill was impaired at the measurement date. We recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $29.4\nmillion in 2022 to write off all the goodwill allocated to our EMEA reporting unit, as the excess of carrying value over fair value\nexceeded the recorded amount of goodwill for the EMEA reporting unit. Macroeconomic factors, including inflation, foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, and the expected impact to planned revenue and operating income contributed to the lower estimated\nfair value of our EMEA reporting unit. Higher discount rates also contributed to the lower fair value of our reporting units. We\ndetermined that the fair value of our Americas reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 71% at the 2022 measurement date,\nand therefore no impairment was indicated. The remaining goodwill balance of $102.4 million at January 1, 2023, was allocated\nto our Americas reporting unit. The goodwill balance allocated to our Asia-Pacific reporting unit was previously written off in\nconnection with the 2020 goodwill impairment.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test consistent with prior years and the\nmethodology described above, and all reporting units that had a goodwill balance were noted to have a fair value that exceeded\ntheir carrying value.\n70\nThe ending balances and the changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each reportable segment for the years\nended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 are as follows(1):\nAMS EAAA Total\n(in thousands)\nGoodwill balance, at January 2, 2022 ................................................. $ 108,505 $ 38,520 $ 147,025\nImpairment ....................................................................................... — (29,384) (29,384)\nForeign currency translation(2) .........................................................

The cumulative impairment losses include impairment charges\nrecognized prior to 2020 related to discontinued operations that were allocated to the current reportable segments on a\nproportionate basis.\n(2) A portion of the goodwill balance allocated to the AMS reportable segment is comprised of goodwill denominated in foreign\ncurrency attributable to the nora acquisition.\nOther Intangible Assets\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its annual impairment testing of the trademark and trade name\nintangible assets and determined that no impairment existed at the 2023 measurement date.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we determined that the trademark and trade name intangible assets related to the acquired nora\nbusiness were impaired and recognized an impairment loss of $6.3 million. The impairment loss consisted of charges of\n$3.6 million and $2.7 million attributable to the AMS and EAAA reportable segments, respectively.\nThe Company’s intangible assets other than goodwill consisted of the following as of December 31, 2023 and January 1,\n2023:\nDecember 31, 2023 January 1, 2023\nGross Net Gross Net\nCarrying Accumulated Accumulated Carrying Carrying Accumulated Accumulated Carrying\nAmount Impairment Amortization Amount Amount Impairment Amortization Amount\n(in thousands)\nIntangible assets subject to\namortization(1):\nTechnology.......................................... $ 37,198 $ — $ (28,845) $ 8,353 $ 36,069 $ — $ (22,854) $ 13,215\nOther ................................................... 734 (478) (20) 236 764 (478) (17) 269\nTotal intangible assets subject to\namortization ........................................ 37,932 (478) (28,865) 8,589 36,833 (478) (22,871) 13,484\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets(1):\nTrademarks and trade names ............... 58,747 (11,081) — 47,666 57,375 (11,081) — 46,294\nTotal intangible assets ............................ $ 96,679 $ (11,559) $ (28,865) $ 56,255 $ 94,208 $ (11,559) $ (22,871) $ 59,778\n(1) Certain intangible asset balances are subject to changes attributable to foreign currency translation.\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets during the years 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $5.2 million, $5.0 million and\n$5.6 million, respectively, and is recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense\nrelated to intangible assets is expected to be approximately $5 million for fiscal year 2024 and approximately $3 million for fiscal\nyear 2025. The developed technology intangible asset is amortized over its estimated useful life, which ends in fiscal year 2025.\n71\nNOTE 13 – PREFERRED STOCK\nThe Company is authorized to designate and issue up to 5,000,000 shares of $1.00 par value preferred stock in one or more\nseries and to determine the rights and preferences of each series, to the extent permitted by the Articles of Incorporation, and to\nfix the terms of such preferred stock without any vote or action by the shareholders. The issuance of any series of preferred stock\nmay have an adverse effect on the rights of holders of common stock and could decrease the amount of earnings and assets\navailable for distribution to holders of common stock. In addition, any issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company. As of December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, there were\nno shares of preferred stock issued.\n72\nNOTE 14 – SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe Company is authorized to issue 120 million shares of $0.10 par value Common Stock. The Company’s Common Stock\nis traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol TILE.\nThe Company paid cash dividends totaling $0.04 per share, including participating securities in each of years 2023, 2022\nand 2021. The future declaration and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company’s Board, and depends upon, among\nother things, the Company’s investment policy and opportunities, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements,\nfuture prospects, and other factors that may be considered relevant at the time of the Board’s determination. Such other factors\ninclude limitations contained in the agreement for its Syndicated Credit Facility and the indenture governing its 5.50% Senior\nNotes due 2028, which specify conditions as to when any dividend payments may be made. As such, the Company may\ndiscontinue its dividend payments in the future if its Board determines that a cessation of dividend payments is appropriate in\nlight of the factors indicated above.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the Company adopted a new share repurchase program in which the Company is authorized\nto repurchase up to $100 million of its outstanding shares of common stock. The program has no specific expiration date. No\nshares of common stock were repurchased pursuant to this program during 2023. During 2022, the Company repurchased and\nretired an aggregate of 1,383,682 shares, at a weighted average price of $12.41 per share, pursuant to this program. All treasury\nstock is accounted for using the cost method.\nThe following tables depict the activity in the accounts which make up shareholders’ equity for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and\n2021:\nFOREIGN\nADDITIONAL CURRENCY CASH\nCOMMON PAID-IN RETAINED PENSION TRANSLATION FLOW\nSHARES STOCK CAPITAL EARNINGS LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT HEDGE TOTAL\n(in thousands)\nBalance, at January 1,\n2023 ............................... 58,106 $ 5,811 $ 244,159 $ 278,639 $ (27,548) $ (138,775) $ (749) $ 361,537\nNet income .................... — — — 44,517 — — — 44,517\nIssuances of stock\nrelated to restricted\nshare units and\nperformance shares ...... 85 8 (8) — — — — —\nRestricted stock\nissuances ...................... 107 11 749 — — — — 760\nUnrecognized\ncompensation expense\nrelated to restricted\nstock awards ................ — — (760) — — — — (760)\nCash dividends\ndeclared ....................... — — — (2,323) — — — (2,323)\nCompensation expense\nrelated to share-based\nplans, net of forfeitures\nand shares received for\ntax withholdings ..........

No award may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the 2020\nOmnibus Plan.\nAccounting standards require that the Company measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of\nequity instruments based on the grant date fair market value of the award. That expense will be recognized over the period that\nthe employee is required to provide the services – the requisite service period (usually the vesting period) – in exchange for the\naward. For certain restricted stock and restricted share unit awards with a graded vesting schedule, the Company has elected to\nrecognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nDuring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted restricted stock awards totaling 107,100, 500,800, and\n428,400 shares, respectively, of Common Stock. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock awards granted\nduring 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $7.10, $13.08, and $14.26, respectively. These awards (or a portion thereof) vest with respect\nto each recipient over a one to three-year period from the date of grant, provided the individual remains in the employment or\nservice of the Company as of the vesting date. Additionally, certain awards (or a portion thereof) could vest earlier in the event\nof a change in control of the Company or upon involuntary termination without cause.\nCompensation expense related to awards of restricted stock was $4.5 million, $5.3 million and $3.8 million for 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively. These grants are made primarily to executive-level personnel at the Company, and as a result, no\ncompensation costs have been capitalized. The Company has reduced its expense for any restricted stock forfeited during the\nperiod. The expense related to awards of restricted stock is captured in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023, as well as activity during the year:\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nRestricted Shares Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 .............................................................................. 1,006,400 $ 13.91\nGranted ................................................................................................................... 107,100 7.10\nVested .....................................................................................................................

There were no restricted share unit awards granted during 2022 or 2021. The weighted average\ngrant date fair value of the restricted share units granted during 2023 was $10.36. Each restricted share unit represents one share\nof the Company’s common stock to be issued to the award recipient once the vesting criteria have been satisfied. Awards of\nrestricted share units have a graded vesting schedule over a two to three-year period from the date of grant, provided the individual\nremains in the employment or service of the Company as of each vesting date. Additionally, certain awards (or a portion thereof)\ncould vest earlier in the event of a change in control of the Company, upon involuntary termination without cause, or upon\nretirement provided certain eligibility criteria are met.\n75\nCompensation expense related to the restricted share units was $1.9 million for 2023. There was no compensation expense\nrelated to restricted share unit awards during 2022 or 2021. These grants are made primarily to executive-level personnel at the\nCompany and, as a result, no compensation costs have been capitalized. The Company has reduced its expense for any restricted\nshare units forfeited during the period. The expense related to awards of restricted share units is captured in SG&A expenses in\nthe consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table summarizes restricted share units outstanding as of December 31, 2023, as well as activity during the\nyear:\nWeighted Average\nRestricted Share Grant Date Fair\nUnits Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 .............................................................................. — $ —\nGranted ................................................................................................................... 596,200 10.36\nVested .....................................................................................................................

That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 2.1 years.\nPerformance Share Awards\nIn each of the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company issued awards of performance shares to certain employees. These\nawards vest based on the achievement of certain performance-based goals over a performance period of one to three years, subject\nto (among other things) the employee’s continued employment through the last date of the performance period and will be settled\nin shares of our common stock or in cash at the Company’s election. The number of shares that may be issued in settlement of\nthe performance shares to the award recipients may be greater (up to 200%) or lesser than the nominal award amount depending\non actual performance achieved as compared to the performance targets set forth in the awards. The expense related to these\nperformance shares is captured in SG&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company evaluates the\nprobability of achieving the performance-based goals as of the end of each reporting period and adjusts compensation expense\nbased on this assessment.\nThe following table summarizes the performance shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023, as well as the activity during\nthe year:\nWeighted Average\nPerformance Grant Date Fair\nShares Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2023 .............................................................................. 923,600 $ 13.91\nGranted ................................................................................................................... 467,500 10.79\nVested .....................................................................................................................

The Company has reduced its expense for any performance shares forfeited during the period. Unrecognized\ncompensation expense related to these performance shares was approximately $5.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The amount\nand timing of future compensation expense will depend on the performance of the Company. The compensation expense related\nto these outstanding performance shares is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of 1.7\nyears.\nThe tax benefit recognized with respect to restricted stock, restricted share units and performance shares was $0.9 million,\n$0.8 million, and $0.7 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n76\nNOTE 15 – EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company computes basic earnings per share (“EPS”) by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares\noutstanding, including participating securities outstanding, during the period as discussed below. Diluted EPS reflects the\npotential dilution beyond shares for basic EPS that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were\nexercised, converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would have shared in the Company’s\nearnings.\nThe Company includes all unvested stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents,\nwhether paid or unpaid, in the number of shares outstanding for basic EPS as these awards are considered participating securities.\nAny unvested stock awards considered non-participating securities are included in diluted EPS calculations when the inclusion\nof these shares would be dilutive. Unvested share-based awards of restricted stock are paid dividends equally with all other shares\nof common stock. As a result, the Company includes all outstanding restricted stock awards in the calculation of basic and diluted\nEPS. Distributed earnings include common stock dividends and dividends earned on unvested share-based payment awards.\nUndistributed earnings represent earnings that were available for distribution but were not distributed. The following table shows\nthe computation of basic and diluted EPS:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nNumerator:\nNet income ............................................................................... $ 44,517 $ 19,560 $ 55,234\nLess: distributed and undistributed earnings available to\nparticipating securities ..........................................................

The plan involved a reduction of approximately 188 employees\nand the closure of the Company’s manufacturing facility in Thailand at the end of the first quarter of 2022.\n78\nExpected charges and cumulative charges incurred to date under the 2021 restructuring plan are as follows:\nAsset\nImpairment\nand Other\nWorkforce Retention Related\nReduction Bonuses Charges Total\n(in thousands)\nEstimated expected charges(1) ........................................ $ 2,281 $ 474 $ 3,295 $ 6,050\nCumulative charges incurred to date(1) .......................... 2,281 474 3,295 6,050\n(1) Charges are attributable to the EAAA reportable segment.\nThe Company recognized a gain of $2.7 million on the sale of the Thailand facility during 2023. See Note 7 entitled “Property,\nPlant and Equipment” for additional information.\nDuring 2022, in conjunction with the closure of its Thailand facility, the Company recorded a write-down of inventory of\n$2.5 million within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company completed the 2021 restructuring plan in the second quarter of 2023, following the sale of the Thailand facility,\nas described in Note 7 entitled “Property, Plant and Equipment,” and expected the plan to yield annualized savings of\napproximately $1.7 million. A portion of the annualized savings was realized in the consolidated statements of operations in 2022,\nwith the remaining portion of the annualized savings realized in 2023.\n2019 Restructuring Plan\nOn December 23, 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan that continued to focus on efforts to improve\nefficiencies and decrease costs across its worldwide operations, and more closely align its operating structure with its business\nstrategy. The plan involved a reduction of approximately 105 employees and early termination of two office leases. As a result\nof this plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 of approximately $9.0 million\n(comprised of $1.1 million attributable to the AMS reportable segment and $7.9 million attributable to the EAAA reportable\nsegment). The charge was comprised of severance expenses ($8.8 million) and lease exit costs ($0.2 million). The plan was\nexpected to result in future cash expenditures of approximately $9.0 million for the payment of employee severance and lease\nexit costs.\nIn 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded reductions of $0.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of the previously\nrecognized charges due to changes in expected cash payments for employee severance. The 2019 restructuring plan was\ncompleted as of the end of the first quarter of 2022. Cumulative charges under the 2019 restructuring plan, net of reductions of\npreviously recognized charges, were $0.8 million within the AMS reportable segment and $4.2 million within the EAAA\nreportable segment. The Company expected the plan to yield annualized savings of approximately $6.0 million. A portion of the\nannualized savings was realized in the consolidated statements of operations in 2020, with the remaining portion of the annualized\nsavings realized in 2021.\n79\nNOTE 17 – INCOME TAXES\nIncome before income taxes consisted of the following:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nU.S. operations .................................................................. $ 3,611 $ 11,758 $ 4,460\nForeign operations ............................................................. 60,043 30,159 68,173\nIncome before income taxes .............................................. $ 63,654 $ 41,917 $ 72,633\nProvisions for federal, foreign and state income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations consisted of the following\ncomponents:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCurrent expense:\nFederal ........................................................................ $ 5,523 $ 1,624 $ 1,987\nForeign ....................................................................... 18,330 20,903 21,372\nState ............................................................................ 2,167 1,307 1,418\nCurrent expense ................................................................. 26,020 23,834 24,777\nDeferred (benefit) expense:\nFederal ........................................................................

The Inflation Reduction Act did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements\nfor the year ended December 31, 2023.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published Pillar Two\nModel Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The\nOECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar\nTwo global minimum tax. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components\nof the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of additional\ncomponents in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. We are still closely monitoring\ndevelopments and evaluating the potential impact on future periods.\nDeferred income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, reflect the net tax effects of temporary\ndifferences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for\nincome tax purposes.\n81\nThe temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nEnd of Fiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets\nLease liability ....................................................................................................................... $ 25,164 $ 23,649\nNet operating loss and interest carryforwards ...................................................................... 9,587 7,616\nFederal tax credit carryforwards .......................................................................................... 7,876 10,904\nDerivative instruments ......................................................................................................... — 295\nDeferred compensation ........................................................................................................ 16,517 16,577\nInventory .............................................................................................................................. 3,041 3,521\nPrepaids, accruals and reserves ............................................................................................ 8,147 6,947\nCapitalized costs .................................................................................................................. 9,442 7,467\nOther .................................................................................................................................... — 58\nDeferred tax asset, gross ......................................................................................................... 79,774 77,034\nValuation allowance .............................................................................................................

A full valuation allowance has been provided as the Company does not expect to utilize these foreign tax\ncredits before the expiration dates. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has approximately $192.1 million in state net\noperating loss carryforwards relating to continuing operations with expiration dates through 2043 and has provided a valuation\nallowance against $129.6 million of such losses, which the Company does not expect to utilize. In addition, as of December 31,\n2023, the Company has approximately $15.6 million in state net operating loss carryforwards relating to discontinued operations\nagainst which a full valuation allowance has been provided.\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company had approximately $3.8 million in tax attributes with a full valuation allowance related\nto foreign tax credit carryforwards and foreign net operating loss carryforwards that expired. As a result, the expiration of these\ntax attributes did not have an impact on the Company’s effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, non-current deferred tax assets were reduced by approximately $2.8 million\nof unrecognized tax benefits.\n82\nHistorically, the Company has not provided for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed\naccumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, with the exception of its Canada subsidiaries and a specific portion of the\nundistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries outside of Canada, because such earnings were deemed to be permanently\nreinvested. In September of 2021, as part of an overall restructuring plan, the Company made the decision to close its\nmanufacturing facility in Thailand. As a result, the Company is no longer asserting that the undistributed earnings in its Thailand\nsubsidiaries are permanently reinvested. The Company provided for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on these\nearnings at December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023.\nAlthough the Tax Act created a dividends received deduction that generally eliminates additional U.S. federal income taxes\non dividends from our foreign subsidiaries, the Company continues to assert that all of its undistributed earnings in its non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, excluding undistributed earnings for which U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have been provided,\nare indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. The Company expects that domestic cash resources will be sufficient to fund its\ndomestic operations and cash commitments in the future. In the event the Company determines not to continue to assert that all\nor part of its undistributed earnings in its non-U.S. subsidiaries are permanently reinvested, an actual repatriation of earnings\nfrom its non-U.S. subsidiaries could still be subject to additional foreign withholding and U.S. state taxes, the determination of\nwhich is not practicable.\nThe Company’s federal income tax returns are subject to examination for the years 2020 to the present. The Company files\nreturns in numerous state and local jurisdictions and in general it is subject to examination by the state tax authorities for the years\n2018 to the present. The Company files returns in numerous foreign jurisdictions and in general it is subject to examination by\nthe foreign tax authorities for the years 2012 to the present.\nAs a result of an audit of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries, Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (“HMRC”) issued notices of\namendment to the Company’s U.K. tax returns for the years 2012 through 2017. The adjustments result from the interest rate\napplied in the intra-group financing arrangement between a Company subsidiary in the U.K. and another in the Netherlands. In\nApril of 2021, the Company filed requests with both the Competent Authority in the Netherlands and in the U.K. to initiate a\nmutual agreement procedure (“MAP”) related to the double taxation arising from the HMRC adjustments. In June of 2022, the\nCompetent Authorities reached an agreement on the interest rate to be applied for the years 2012 through 2017. The Company\nrecognized the adjustments from the 2012-2017 MAP in 2022. In March of 2023, the Company filed requests with both the\nCompetent Authority in the Netherlands and in the U.K. to initiate a MAP for tax years 2018 through 2020 related to the double\ntaxation arising from the application of the HMRC interest rate adjustments that were the subject of the 2012-2017 MAP. In\nSeptember 2023, the Competent Authorities reached an agreement on the interest rate to be applied for the years 2018 through\n2020. The Company recognized the adjustments from the 2018-2020 MAP in 2023. The recognition of the adjustments in both\n2022 and 2023 did not have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate or its financial position.\nAs of December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, the Company had $4.9 million and $5.7 million, respectively, of\nunrecognized tax benefits. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the Company recognized as income tax\nbenefits $0.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of previously unrecognized tax benefits. While it is reasonably possible that\nsome of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized within the next 12 months, the Company does not expect the recognition\nof such amounts will have a material impact on the Company’s financial results.\nIf any of the $4.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2023 are recognized, there would be a favorable\nimpact on the Company’s effective tax rate of approximately $4.9 million in future periods. If the unrecognized tax benefits are\nnot favorably settled, $2.1 million of the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits would require the use of cash in future periods.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and income tax penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income\ntax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were $0.4 million as of December 31, 2023 and were included in the total\nunrecognized tax benefit noted above. The timing of the ultimate resolution of the Company’s tax matters and the payment and\nreceipt of related cash is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside the Company’s control.\n83\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of year .............................................................. $ 5,743 $ 8,220 $ 10,799\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the current year ....... 320 342 265\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during the prior years ......... 140 204 198\nDecreases related to tax positions taken during the prior years .......

Some of the proceedings the Company is involved in are summarized below.\nLawsuit by Former CEO in Connection with Termination\nOn January 19, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to terminate for cause the employment of Jay D. Gould, then\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately, for violations of the Company’s working environment policies. On\nFebruary 14, 2020, Mr. Gould filed a lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court of the Northern District of\nGeorgia, Gould v. Interface, Inc., Case No. 1:20-cv-00695. In his lawsuit, Mr. Gould asserted several claims against the Company\nin connection with his termination, including that the termination was a wrongful retaliation against Mr. Gould and breached his\nemployment contract with the Company, that public statements made by the Company in connection with his termination defamed\nMr. Gould (two counts) and that the Company’s investigation into Mr. Gould’s conduct that preceded the termination was\nnegligently performed. Among other unspecified relief, Mr. Gould sought in excess of $10 million in damages for the breach of\ncontract claim and $100 million for each of the other claims, as well as attorneys’ fees. The Court granted judgment on the\npleadings in favor of the Company on Mr. Gould’s putative claim of negligent investigation, and Mr. Gould’s defamation claims\nwere dismissed with prejudice by stipulation of the parties. On March 31, 2022, the Court entered an order granting the Company’s\nmotion for summary judgment on all of Mr. Gould’s remaining claims, leaving only the Company’s counterclaim against Mr.\nGould for breach of fiduciary duty pending in the District Court. An attempted interlocutory appeal by Mr. Gould of the summary\njudgment order was remanded by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals back to the District Court as premature. Mr. Gould filed a\nmotion for reconsideration of the Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company on Mr. Gould’s breach of contract\nclaim. On July 31, 2023, the Court denied that motion for reconsideration. Also on July 31, 2023, the Company filed a motion to\ndismiss without prejudice its counterclaim against Mr. Gould for breach of fiduciary duty. On August 2, 2023, the Court granted\nthat motion to dismiss, resulting in a final judgment in the trial court. The Court’s award of summary judgment in favor of the\nCompany on Mr. Gould’s breach of contract claim has been appealed by Mr. Gould to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th\nCircuit, and that appeal remains pending.\nThe Company believes Mr. Gould’s lawsuit and the appeal therefrom is without merit and intends to defend vigorously against\nit.\nPutative Class Action Lawsuit\nOn November 12, 2020, the Company and certain former and current officers were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Swanson v. Interface, Inc. et al. (case :120-cv-05518). The\nlawsuit was a federal securities law putative class action that alleged that the defendants made materially false and misleading\nstatements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. The specific allegations related to the subject\nmatter of a previously disclosed and concluded SEC investigation. The complaint did not quantify the damages sought. In 2023,\nthe parties settled the lawsuit for $7.5 million, and the Company’s insurers funded the settlement amount.\n85\nNOTE 19 – EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nDefined Contribution and Deferred Compensation Plans\nThe Company has a 401(k) retirement investment plan (“401(k) Plan”), which is open to all eligible U.S. employees with at\nleast six months of service. The 401(k) Plan provides Company matching contributions on a sliding scale based on the level of\nthe employee’s contribution. The Company may, at its discretion, make additional contributions to the 401(k) Plan based on the\nattainment of certain performance targets by its subsidiaries. The Company’s matching contributions are funded bi-monthly and\ntotaled approximately $3.4 million, $3.3 million, and $3.0 million for the years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. No\ndiscretionary contributions were made in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nUnder the Company’s nonqualified savings plans (“NSPs”), the Company provides eligible employees the opportunity to\nenter into agreements for the deferral of a specified percentage of their compensation, as defined in the NSPs. The NSPs provide\nCompany matching contributions on a sliding scale based on the level of the employee’s contribution. The obligations of the\nCompany under such agreements to pay the deferred compensation in the future in accordance with the terms of the NSPs are\nunsecured general obligations of the Company. Participants have no right, interest or claim in the assets of the Company, except\nas unsecured general creditors. The Company has established a rabbi trust to hold, invest and reinvest deferrals and contributions\nunder the NSPs. If a change in control of the Company occurs, as defined in the NSPs, the Company will contribute an amount\nto the rabbi trust sufficient to pay the obligation owed to each participant. The deferred compensation liability in connection with\nthe NSPs totaled $28.2 million and $27.5 million at December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The Company invests\nthe deferrals in insurance instruments with readily determinable cash surrender values and in exchange traded mutual funds. The\nvalue of the insurance instruments was $19.2 million and $16.6 million as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023,\nrespectively. The fair value of the mutual fund investments at December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 was $9.2 million and $11.0\nmillion, respectively.\nMultiemployer Plan\nOn December 31, 2019, a plan amendment was executed to eliminate future service accruals in our defined benefit pension\nplan in the Netherlands (the “Dutch Plan”), which resulted in a curtailment of the plan. The Dutch Plan remains in existence and\ncontinues to pay vested benefits. Active participants no longer accrue benefits after December 31, 2019, and instead participate\nin the Industry-Wide Pension Fund (the “IWPF”) multi-employer plan beginning in fiscal year 2020. During 2023, 2022 and\n2021, the Company recorded multi-employer pension expense related to multiemployer contributions of $2.7 million, $2.4 million\nand $2.6 million, respectively. The Company’s contributions into the IWPF are less than 5% of total plan contributions. The IWPF\nis more than 85% funded at the end of 2022, which is the latest date plan information is available. The IWPF multi-employer plan\nis not considered to be significant based on the funded status of the plan and our contributions.\nForeign Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company has trusteed defined benefit retirement plans which cover many of its European employees. The benefits under\nthese defined benefit retirement plans are generally based on years of service and the employee’s average monthly compensation.\nIn connection with the nora acquisition in 2018, the Company acquired an additional defined benefit plan, which covers certain\nemployees in Germany (the “nora Plan”). The nora plan has no plan assets. The Company uses a year-end measurement date for\nthe plans, which is the closest practical date to the Company’s fiscal year end.\nAs described above, on December 31, 2019, a plan amendment was executed to eliminate future service accruals in the Dutch\ndefined benefit plan. The Dutch Plan remains in existence and continues to pay vested benefits. The reduction in future benefit\naccruals resulted in a curtailment of the Dutch Plan. Participants in the Dutch Plan no longer accrue benefits under the plan after\nDecember 31, 2019, and participate in the IWPF beginning in fiscal year 2020. Although the Dutch Plan is frozen to new\nparticipants, vested benefits will continue to be accounted for in accordance with applicable accounting standards for defined\nbenefit plans. The Dutch Plan is financed by assets held in an insurance contract. The guarantee provision included in the\ninsurance contract, that existed to fund any shortfall between the fair value of plan investments and the benefit obligation, expired\non December 31, 2019. The Company will fund the cost to guarantee vested benefits and this amount is recorded as an obligation\non the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nAs discussed above, the Company still has an obligation to pay vested benefits in the frozen Dutch Plan. As of December 31,\n2023, the under-funded status of the Dutch Plan of $5.7 million is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in other long-term\nliabilities.\nPension expense for our three European defined benefit plans was $1.3 million, $2.0 million, and $2.5 million for the years\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Plan assets are primarily invested in insurance contracts and fixed income securities. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, for the European plans, the Company had a net liability recorded of $15.1 million, an amount equal to their\n86\nunder-funded status, and had recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss an amount equal to $29.9 million (net of taxes\nof approximately $8.1 million) related to the future amounts to be recorded in net periodic benefit costs. In the next fiscal year,\napproximately $1.3 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost.\nThe tables presented below set forth the funded status of the Company’s significant foreign defined benefit plans and required\ndisclosures in accordance with applicable accounting standards:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year ................................................................. $ 195,440 $ 324,408\nService cost ......................................................................................................... 458 840\nInterest cost ......................................................................................................... 8,169 3,793\nBenefits and expenses paid .................................................................................

The increase in the projected benefit obligation of $19.0 million for 2023 compared to\nprior year was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to measure the obligation and the impact of\nforeign currency translation due to the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar in 2023. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, one of these plans, which primarily covers certain employees in the United Kingdom (the “UK Plan”), had\nassets in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation of the Dutch Plan exceeded plan assets\nas of December 31, 2023. The nora Plan is an unfunded defined benefit plan and the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded\nplan assets as of December 31, 2023. The following table summarizes this information as of December 31, 2023 and January 1,\n2023.\nEnd of Fiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nUK Plan\nProjected benefit obligation .................................................................................... $ 108,424 $ 98,730\nAccumulated benefit obligation.............................................................................. 108,424 98,730\nPlan assets............................................................................................................... 133,658 125,315\nDutch Plan\nProjected benefit obligation .................................................................................... $ 71,422 $ 67,689\nAccumulated benefit obligation.............................................................................. 71,422 67,689\nPlan assets............................................................................................................... 65,690 62,170\nnora Plan\nProjected benefit obligation .................................................................................... $ 34,582 $ 29,021\nAccumulated benefit obligation.............................................................................. 34,582 29,021\nPlan assets............................................................................................................... — —\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost:\nService cost ............................................................................... $ 458 $ 840 $ 1,087\nInterest cost ............................................................................... 8,169 3,793 2,687\nExpected return on plan assets ..................................................

Expected returns reflect a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial\nmarkets, and include input from actuaries, investment service firms and investment managers.\nThe investment objectives of the foreign defined benefit plans are to maximize the return on the investments to ensure that\nthe assets are sufficient to exceed minimum funding requirements, and to achieve a favorable return against performance\nexpectations based on historical and projected rates of return over the short term. The goal is to optimize the long-term return on\nplan assets at a moderate level of risk, by balancing higher-returning assets, such as equity securities, with less volatile assets,\nsuch as fixed income securities. The assets are managed by professional investment firms and performance is evaluated\nperiodically against specific benchmarks. The plans’ net assets did not include the Company’s own stock at December 31, 2023\nor January 1, 2023.\nDutch Plan Assets and Indexation Benefit\nAs is common in Dutch pension plans, the Dutch Plan includes a provision for discretionary benefit increases termed\n“indexation.” The indexation benefit is meant to adjust pension benefits for cost-of-living increases, similar to U.S. consumer\nprice index-based cost-of-living adjustments for U.S. retirement plans. The indexation benefit is not guaranteed, and is only\nprovided for and paid out if sufficient assets are available due to favorable asset returns.\nBoth the vested benefit amounts as well as amounts related to the discretionary indexation benefits under the Dutch Plan are\npaid pursuant to an insurance contract with a private insurer (the “Contract”). The Dutch Plan itself is financed by investment\nassets held within the Contract. Prior to December 31, 2019, the Contract guaranteed payment of vested benefits, regardless of\nwhether Dutch Plan assets held through the Contract were ultimately sufficient to pay vested amounts, and also provided for\npayment of the indexation amount on a contingent basis if the actual return on Dutch Plan assets were sufficient to pay it. This\ntype of insurance arrangement is common in The Netherlands, although not necessarily common in other jurisdictions. After the\nDutch Plan curtailment on December 31, 2019, any shortfall in plan assets to pay vested benefits will be funded by the Company.\nThe assets under the Dutch Plan, including any indexation benefit, are identified as level 3 assets under the fair value hierarchy.\nUnder the express terms of the Contract, contract value is the greater of (i) the value of the discounted vested benefits of the\nDutch Plan and (ii) the fair value of the underlying investment assets held by the insurance company under the Contract. As\nbetween those two values, the former was the greater for 2023 and 2022. Because the Company will fund the cost to guarantee\nvested benefits, the Company has recorded a provision, which reduces the Dutch Plan assets, that consists of the net present value\nof the expected future guarantee payments due to the insurance company pursuant to the Company’s guarantee.\nAs explained above, the Contract also will pay the indexation benefit if sufficient assets are available, which the Company\nbelieves not to be probable as of the end of 2023 based on recent returns. The indexation benefit for 2023 and 2022 is not\nsignificant.\n89\nThe Company’s actual weighted average asset allocations for 2023 and 2022, and the targeted asset allocation for 2024, of\nthe foreign defined benefit plans by asset category, are as follows:\nFiscal Year\n2024 2023 2022\nAsset Category Target Allocation Percentage of Plan Assets at Year End\nEquity securities ............................................................... —% — —% —% —%\nDebt and debt securities .................................................... 65% — 70% 59% 53%\nShort-term investments ..................................................... —% — 2% 8% 13%\nOther investments ............................................................. 30% — 35% 33% 34%\n100% 100% 100%\nThe following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy the foreign defined benefit plans’ assets at fair value,\nas of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023. The nora plan is currently unfunded. As required by accounting standards, assets\nare classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. As noted above,\nthe Dutch Plan assets as represented by the insurance contract are classified as a level 3 asset and included in the “Other” asset\ncategory.\nPension Plan Assets by Category as of December 31, 2023\nDutch Plan UK Plan Total\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1 ............................................................................... $ — $ 16,232 $ 16,232\nLevel 2 ............................................................................... — 92,200 92,200\nLevel 3 ............................................................................... 65,690 25,226 90,916\nTotal ................................................................................... $ 65,690 $ 133,658 $ 199,348\nPension Plan Assets by Category as of January 1, 2023\nDutch Plan UK Plan Total\n(in thousands)\nLevel 1 ............................................................................... $ — $ 44,335 $ 44,335\nLevel 2 ............................................................................... — 53,286 53,286\nLevel 3 ............................................................................... 62,170 27,694 89,864\nTotal ................................................................................... $ 62,170 $ 125,315 $ 187,485\nThe tables below detail the foreign defined benefit plans’ assets by asset allocation and fair value hierarchy:\nEnd of Fiscal Year 2023\nAsset Category Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nDebt and debt securities ..................................................... $ — $ 92,200 $ 24,325\nShort-term investments (1) .................................................. 16,232 — —\nOther investments (2) .......................................................... — — 66,591\n$ 16,232 $ 92,200 $ 90,916\nEnd of Fiscal Year 2022\nAsset Category Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\n(in thousands)\nDebt and debt securities ..................................................... $ 19,614 $ 53,286 $ 26,778\nShort-term investments (1) .................................................. 24,721 — —\nOther investments (2) .......................................................... — — 63,086\n$ 44,335 $ 53,286 $ 89,864\n(1) Short-term investments are generally invested in interest-bearing accounts.\n(2) Other investments are comprised of insurance contracts.\n90\nAssets identified as level 2 above pertain to corporate bonds and other debt securities. The fair values of these assets are\ncalculated based on quoted market prices for similar assets.\nWith the exception of the Dutch Plan assets as discussed above, the assets identified as level 3 above in 2023 and 2022 relate\nto insured annuities and direct lending assets held by the UK Plan. The fair value of these assets was calculated using the present\nvalue of the future cash flows due under the insurance annuities, and for the direct lending assets the value is based on the asset\nvalue from the latest available valuation with adjustments for any drawdowns and distribution payments made between the\nvaluation date and the reporting date. The range of discount rates used in the fair value calculation of level 3 assets held by the\nDutch Plan and the UK Plan were 3.30% to 4.50% for 2023, and 3.70% to 4.75% for 2022. The weighted average discount rates\nwere 3.32% and 3.72% for 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts are weighted based on the fair value of level 3 plan assets\nsubject to fluctuations in the discount rate. Any changes in these variables will impact the fair value of level 3 assets.\nThe table below indicates the change in value related to these level 3 assets during 2023 and 2022:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nBalance of level 3 assets, beginning of year ........................................................... $ 89,864 $ 121,126\nActual return on plan assets (1)............................................................................. 3,429 (21,968)\nPurchases, sales and settlements, net ..................................................................

The SCP entitles\nparticipants to: (i) retirement benefits upon normal retirement at age 65 (or early retirement as early as age 55) after completing\nat least 15 years of service with the Company (unless otherwise provided in the SCP), payable for the remainder of their lives (or,\nif elected by a participant, a reduced benefit is payable for the remainder of the participant’s life and any surviving spouse’s life)\nand in no event less than 10 years under the death benefit feature; (ii) disability benefits payable for the period of any total\ndisability; and (iii) death benefits payable to the designated beneficiary of the participant for a period of up to 10 years. Benefits\nare determined according to one of three formulas contained in the SCP, and the SCP is administered by the Compensation\nCommittee of the Company’s Board of Directors, which has full discretion in choosing participants and the benefit formula\napplicable to each. The Company’s obligations under the SCP are currently unfunded (although the Company uses insurance\ninstruments to hedge its exposure thereunder). The Company is required to contribute the present value of its obligations\nthereunder to an irrevocable grantor trust in the event of a change in control as defined in the SCP. The Company uses a year-end\nmeasurement date for the domestic SCP.\nThe tables presented below set forth the required disclosures in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and\namounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to the domestic SCP. There is no service cost component in\nthe change in benefit obligation in 2023 and 2022 as there are no longer any participants accruing benefits in the plan.\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year ................................................................. $ 22,731 $ 30,053\nInterest cost ......................................................................................................... 1,134 771\nBenefits paid .......................................................................................................

Additionally, accounting standards require the utilization of a\n“management approach” to report the financial results of operating segments, which is based on information used by the CODM\nto assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. The Company determined that it has two operating\nsegments organized by geographical area – namely (a) Americas (“AMS”) and (b) Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia (collectively\n“EAAA”). The AMS operating segment includes the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic areas.\nPursuant to the management approach discussed above, the Company’s CODM, our chief executive officer, evaluates\nperformance at the AMS and EAAA operating segment levels and makes operating and resource allocation decisions based on\nsegment adjusted operating income (“AOI”), which includes allocations of corporate selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAOI excludes nora purchase accounting amortization; Thailand plant closure inventory write-down; Cyber Event impact;\ngoodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; and restructuring, asset impairment, severance, and other, net. Intersegment\nrevenues for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $82.8 million, $75.5 million and $78.1 million, respectively. Intersegment revenues are\neliminated from net sales presented below since these amounts are not included in the information provided to the CODM.\nThe Company has determined that it has two reportable segments – AMS and EAAA, as each operating segment meets the\nquantitative thresholds defined in the accounting guidance.\nSegment information for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the table below:\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nNet sales\nAMS ........................................................................................... $ 736,955 $ 753,740 $ 651,216\nEAAA ........................................................................................ 524,543 544,179 549,182\nTotal net sales ............................................................................... $ 1,261,498 $ 1,297,919 $ 1,200,398\nSegment AOI\nAMS ........................................................................................... $ 87,789 $ 102,370 $ 85,014\nEAAA ........................................................................................ 28,608 30,058 37,268\nDepreciation and amortization\nAMS ........................................................................................... $ 17,989 $ 16,827 $ 17,963\nEAAA ........................................................................................ 22,785 23,510 28,382\nTotal depreciation and amortization ............................................. $ 40,774 $ 40,337 $ 46,345\n94\nA reconciliation of the Company’s total operating segment assets to the corresponding consolidated amounts follows:\nEnd of Fiscal Year\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nAssets\nAMS ..................................................................................................................... $ 627,782 $ 588,110\nEAAA .................................................................................................................. 630,939 652,921\nTotal segment assets ............................................................................................... 1,258,721 1,241,031\nCorporate assets ...................................................................................................... 108,673 110,495\nEliminations............................................................................................................

(the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, and\nJanuary 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three\nfiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statements schedule listed in the\naccompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated\nfinancial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023, and\nJanuary 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December\n31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission (“COSO”) and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with\nthe PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a\ntest basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n98\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairment Assessment\nAs described in Notes 1 and 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $105.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2023, all allocated to the Americas reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and\nbetween annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. If the carrying value of the\nAmericas reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount of\nthe excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company estimates the fair value of the\nAmericas reporting unit using a combination of fair values derived from an income methodology and a market comparable\nmethodology. The Company’s consolidated trademark and tradename intangible assets were $47.7 million as of December 31,\n2023. Trademark and tradename intangible assets acquired in connection with the nora acquisition are not subject to amortization,\nbut are tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more\nlikely than not reduce the fair value of the intangible assets below their carrying amount. The Company prepared valuations of\nthe intangible assets using the present value of cash flows under the relief from royalty method, which were compared to the\ncarrying value of intangible assets to determine whether any impairment existed.\nWe identified the income approach valuation methodology used in the impairment evaluation of goodwill for the Americas\nreporting unit and the nora tradename intangibles as a critical audit matter due to the inherent subjectivity involved in\nmanagement’s determination of (i) forecasts of revenues and (ii) the discount rate. The audit procedures to evaluate the\nreasonableness of these assumptions involved a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the\ninvolvement of individuals with specialized skill or knowledge.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\n• Evaluating management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by performing a retrospective review comparing\nmanagement’s prior period forecasts to actual results for the same period.\n• Inquiring of management to understand the process for developing the forecasts of future revenues and evaluating the\nconsistency of the revenue forecasts used with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n• Testing management’s process used to evaluate goodwill and the nora tradename intangibles for impairment, including\nevaluating the reasonableness of the forecasts of future revenues by comparing forecasts of future revenues to (1)\nhistorical results and the recent trend of revenue growth rates, (2) forecasted information included in industry reports for\nthe Company and its peer companies, (3) publicly available industry analyst projections, and (4) external\ncommunications made by the Company.\n• Utilizing our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of the Company’s discount rate by (i) testing\nthe source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, (ii) testing the mathematical accuracy of the\ncalculations; and (iii) developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by\nmanagement.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nWe are uncertain as to the year we began serving consecutively as the auditor of the Company's financial statements; however,\nwe are aware that we have been the Company's auditor consecutively since at least 1981.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 28, 2024\n99\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nInterface, Inc.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Interface, Inc.’s (the “Company’s”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of\nthe Treadway Commission (the “COSO criteria”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period\nended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statements schedule and our report dated February 28, 2024\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management’s\nAnnual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required\nto be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those\nstandards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, P.C.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 28, 2024\n100\nITEM 9.

Based on that evaluation,\nour principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting\nthat occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. The management of the Company is responsible\nfor establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f)\npromulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only\nreasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based\non the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nOur independent auditors have issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThis report immediately precedes Item 9 of this Report.\nITEM 9B.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 1 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nReferences in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to “Interface,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer\nto Interface, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them, unless the context requires otherwise.\nAs contemplated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) instructions to Form 10-Q, the\nfollowing footnotes have been condensed and, therefore, do not contain all disclosures required in connection with annual\nfinancial statements. Reference should be made to the Company’s year-end financial statements and notes thereto contained in\nits Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Commission.\nThe financial information included in this report has been prepared by the Company, without audit. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the financial information included in this report contains all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the\nresults for the interim periods. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless otherwise disclosed. Nevertheless,\nthe results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year. The December 31,\n2023, consolidated condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all\ndisclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nThe nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 both include 39 weeks. The three-month periods\nended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 both include 13 weeks.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nGlobal economic challenges, including the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars or other conflicts around\nthe globe, supply chain disruptions, and slow macro environments in certain geographical regions could cause economic\nuncertainty and volatility. In connection with the Cyber Event discussed below, security breaches may expose us to fines and\nother liabilities to the extent sensitive data stored in our IT systems, including data related to customers, suppliers or employees,\nare misappropriated. The Company considered these impacts and subsequent general uncertainties and volatility in the global\neconomy on the assumptions and estimates used herein. These uncertainties could result in a future material adverse effect to\nthe amounts reported within the Company’s consolidated condensed financial statements if actual results differ from these\nestimates.\nCybersecurity Event\nOn November 20, 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT\nsystems (the “Cyber Event”). In response to this Cyber Event, we notified law enforcement and took steps to supplement\nexisting security monitoring, including scanning and protective measures. The investigation of the Cyber Event by our forensic\nexperts was completed during fiscal year 2023.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications to previously reported information have been made in the consolidated condensed statements of\ncash flows to conform to the current period presentation. The previously reported line item “deferred income taxes and other”\nwas separated into two line items in the current period presentation of the consolidated condensed statements of cash flows to\nprovide additional information. These reclassifications had no effect on cash provided by operating activities as previously\nreported.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements – Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This ASU requires public entities on an\nannual basis to disclose a rate reconciliation with explicit categories, as outlined in the ASU, and requires additional disclosures\nfor reconciling items that meet certain quantitative thresholds. Other disclosures include disaggregation of income taxes paid,\npre-tax income, and income tax expense. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.\nEarly adoption is permitted. We are currently assessing the updated guidance; however, it is not expected to have a material\nimpact to our consolidated financial statements.\n7\nTable of Contents\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures.” This ASU requires additional disclosures in annual and interim periods for significant segment expenses\nincluded in the measure of segment profit provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Disclosure of other\nsegment items by reportable segment as well as a description of its composition is also required. The new guidance is effective\nfor annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company has completed its evaluation of ASU 2023-07 and has determined that the new guidance\nwill enhance our segment disclosures, but will not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\n8\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2 – REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company generates revenue from sales of modular carpet, resilient flooring, rubber flooring, and other flooring-related\nmaterial, and from the installation of carpet and other flooring-related material. A summary of these revenue streams, as a\npercentage of net sales, for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nRevenue from the sale of flooring material 96 % 98 % 97 % 98 %\nRevenue from installation of flooring material 4 2 3 2\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nFor the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, revenue from the Company’s customers is\nbroken down by geography as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\nGeography 2024 2023 2024 2023\nAmericas 61.0 % 57.3 % 60.7 % 58.6 %\nEurope 28.2 30.3 28.9 30.0\nAsia-Pacific 10.8 12.4 10.4 11.4\nRevenue from the Company’s customers in the Americas corresponds to the AMS reportable segment, and the EAAA\nreportable segment includes revenue from the Europe and Asia-Pacific geographies. See Note 10 entitled “Segment\nInformation” for additional information.\n9\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3 – INVENTORIES\nInventories are summarized as follows:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nFinished goods $ 207,740 $ 201,821\nWork-in-process 22,853 20,892\nRaw materials 52,503 56,366\nInventories, net $ 283,096 $ 279,079\n10\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 – EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe Company computes basic earnings per share (“EPS”) by dividing net income by the weighted average common shares\noutstanding, including participating securities outstanding, during the period as discussed below. Diluted EPS reflects the\npotential dilution beyond shares for basic EPS that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were\nexercised, converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would have shared in the Company’s\nearnings.\nThe Company includes all unvested stock awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents,\nwhether paid or unpaid, in the number of shares outstanding for basic EPS as these awards are considered participating\nsecurities. Any unvested stock awards considered non-participating securities are included in diluted EPS calculations when the\ninclusion of these shares would be dilutive. Unvested share-based awards of restricted stock are paid dividends equally with all\nother shares of common stock. As a result, the Company includes all outstanding restricted stock awards in the calculation of\nbasic and diluted EPS. Distributed earnings include common stock dividends and dividends earned on unvested share-based\npayment awards. Undistributed earnings represent earnings that were available for distribution but were not distributed. The\nfollowing table shows the computation of basic and diluted EPS:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 28,443 $ 9,879 $ 65,180 $ 24,962\nLess: distributed and undistributed earnings\navailable to participating securities (119) (117) (425) (327)\nDistributed and undistributed earnings available to\ncommon shareholders $ 28,324 $ 9,762 $ 64,755 $ 24,635\nDenominator:\nWeighted average shares outstanding 58,061 57,420 57,895 57,326\nParticipating securities 244 687 380 761\nShares for basic EPS 58,305 58,107 58,275 58,087\nDilutive effect of non-participating securities 566 235 479 146\nShares for diluted EPS 58,871 58,342 58,754 58,233\nBasic EPS $ 0.49 $ 0.17 $ 1.12 $ 0.43\nDiluted EPS $ 0.48 $ 0.17 $ 1.11 $ 0.43\nFor both the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, there were no securities excluded from the computation of\ndiluted EPS that would have been antidilutive. For both the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, 855,785 of non-\nparticipating securities were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because the effect would have been antidilutive.\n11\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 5 – LONG-TERM DEBT\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\nOutstanding Outstanding\nPrincipal Interest Rate(1) Principal Interest Rate(1)\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nSyndicated Credit Facility(2):\nTerm loan borrowings $ 41,167 5.32 % $ 121,658 6.61 %\n5.50% Senior Notes due 2028 300,000 5.50 % 300,000 5.50 %\nTotal debt 341,167 421,658\nLess: Unamortized debt issuance costs (3,227) (4,445)\nTotal debt, net 337,940 417,213\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt (8,593) (8,572)\nTotal long-term debt, net $ 329,347 $ 408,641\n(1) Represents the weighted average rate of interest for borrowings under the Syndicated Credit Facility and the stated rate of\ninterest for the 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028, without the effect of debt issuance costs.\n(2) The Syndicated Credit Facility also includes a multicurrency revolving loan facility up to $300.0 million. There were no\nrevolving loan borrowings outstanding as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023.\nSyndicated Credit Facility\nThe Company’s Syndicated Credit Facility (the “Facility”) provides to the Company U.S. denominated and multicurrency\nterm loans and provides to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries a multicurrency revolving credit facility. Interest on base\nrate loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage\nratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Interest on SOFR-based and alternative currency loans is charged at\nvarying rates computed by applying a margin over the applicable SOFR rate or alternative currency rate, depending on the\nCompany’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company pays a\ncommitment fee per annum (depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed\nfiscal quarter) on the unused portion of the Facility.\nFees for commercial letters of credit are computed as a percentage of the amount available to be drawn under such letters\nof credit. Fees for standby letters of credit are charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin of the amount available\nto be drawn under such standby letters of credit, depending on the Company’s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most\nrecently completed fiscal quarter. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $0.7 million and\n$1.6 million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding under the Facility.\nAs of both September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s borrowings under the\nFacility approximated its fair value as the Facility bears interest rates that are similar to existing market rates. The fair value of\nborrowings under the Facility is estimated using observable market rates and is considered Level 2 within the fair value\nhierarchy.\nUnder the Facility, the Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments of the term loan borrowings, which\nare due on the last day of the calendar quarter.\nThe Company is in compliance with all covenants under the Facility and anticipates that it will remain in compliance with\nthe covenants for the foreseeable future.\n12\nTable of Contents\nSenior Notes due 2028\nThe 5.50% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “Senior Notes”) bear an interest rate at 5.50% per annum and mature on December\n1, 2028. Interest is paid semi-annually on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The Senior Notes are unsecured and are\nguaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Company’s material domestic subsidiaries, all of which also guarantee the\nobligations of the Company under its Facility.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was $294.8 million, compared with a net carrying\nvalue recorded in the Company’s consolidated condensed balance sheet of $297.1 million ($300.0 million gross, excluding the\nimpact of $2.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs). The fair value of the Senior Notes is derived using quoted prices for\nsimilar instruments and is considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company is in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the Senior Notes and anticipates that it\nwill remain in compliance with the covenants for the foreseeable future.\n13\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 6 – SHAREHOLDERS’

The aggregate number of shares of common stock\nthat may be issued or transferred under the Amended and Restated Plan on or after the effective date of the plan is the sum of\n3,200,000 shares not previously authorized for issuance under any plan, plus the number of shares remaining available for\nissuance under the original Interface, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the “Original Plan”) but not subject to\noutstanding awards under the Original Plan immediately prior to the effective date of the Amended and Restated Plan, plus the\nnumber of shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to the outstanding awards under the Original Plan immediately\nprior to the effective date of the Amended and Restated Plan, including any shares that become available due to the forfeiture,\ntermination or cancellation of such awards. No award may be granted after the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the\nAmended and Restated Plan.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nCompensation expense related to restricted stock grants was $1.9 million and $3.4 million for the nine months ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively.

Additionally, accounting standards require the utilization of a\n“management approach” to report the financial results of operating segments, which is based on information used by the\nCODM to assess performance and make operating and resource allocation decisions. The Company determined that it has two\noperating segments organized by geographical area – namely (a) Americas (“AMS”) and (b) Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia\n(collectively “EAAA”). The AMS operating segment includes the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic areas.\nPursuant to the management approach discussed above, the Company’s CODM, our chief executive officer, evaluates\nperformance at the AMS and EAAA operating segment levels and makes operating and resource allocation decisions based on\nsegment adjusted operating income (“AOI”), which includes allocations of corporate selling, general and administrative\n(“SG&A”) expenses and allocations of global support SG&A as discussed below. AOI excludes: nora purchase accounting\namortization; Cyber Event impact; property casualty loss; and restructuring, asset impairment, severance, and other, net.\nIntersegment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, were $19.1 million and $60.4 million,\nrespectively, and intersegment revenues for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, were $25.0 million and $72.3\nmillion, respectively. Intersegment revenues are eliminated from net sales presented below since these amounts are not included\nin the information provided to the CODM.\nThe Company has determined that it has two reportable segments – AMS and EAAA, as each operating segment meets the\nquantitative thresholds defined in the accounting guidance.\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a cost center realignment initiative to centralize certain global/\nshared functions. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, SG&A expenses for these global support functions\nwere allocated to AOI for each reportable segment consistent with the allocation methodology used to allocate corporate\noverhead in prior periods. Prior year AOI amounts below were not recast as there was no material impact to the measure of\nsegment profit for each reportable segment. There were no changes to the composition of the Company’s operating or\nreportable segments.\nSegment information for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 is presented in the\nfollowing table:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet sales\nAMS $ 210,155 $ 178,194 $ 595,082 $ 548,716\nEAAA 134,115 132,812 385,566 387,664\nTotal net sales $ 344,270 $ 311,006 $ 980,648 $ 936,380\nSegment AOI\nAMS $ 32,187 $ 23,318 $ 77,214 $ 58,621\nEAAA 11,299 9,049 31,402 16,805\nDepreciation and amortization\nAMS $ 4,453 $ 4,640 $ 13,252 $ 13,457\nEAAA 5,449 5,805 15,994 17,134\nTotal depreciation and amortization $ 9,902 $ 10,445 $ 29,246 $ 30,591\n22\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the Company’s total operating segment assets to the corresponding consolidated amounts follows:\nSeptember 29, 2024 December 31, 2023\n(in thousands)\nAssets\nAMS $ 628,090 $ 627,782\nEAAA 640,638 630,939\nTotal segment assets 1,268,728 1,258,721\nCorporate assets 112,674 108,673\nEliminations (138,138) (137,299)\nTotal reported assets $ 1,243,264 $ 1,230,095\nReconciliations of operating income to income before income tax expense and segment AOI are presented as follows:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nAMS operating income $ 31,878 $ 23,530 $ 76,877 $ 56,997\nEAAA operating income 10,297 7,455 27,895 12,373\nConsolidated operating income 42,175 30,985 104,772 69,370\nInterest expense 5,721 8,163 18,317 24,986\nOther expense, net 381 6,702 237 7,674\nIncome before income tax expense $ 36,073 $ 16,120 $ 86,218 $ 36,710\nThree Months Ended Three Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\nAMS EAAA AMS EAAA\n(in thousands)\nOperating income $ 31,878 $ 10,297 $ 23,530 $ 7,455\nPurchase accounting amortization — 1,311 — 1,302\nCyber Event impact — — 62 42\nRestructuring, asset impairment, severance, and\nother, net 309 (309) (274) 250\nAOI $ 32,187 $ 11,299 $ 23,318 $ 9,049\nNine Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\nAMS EAAA AMS EAAA\n(in thousands)\nOperating income $ 76,877 $ 27,895 $ 56,997 $ 12,373\nPurchase accounting amortization — 3,895 — 3,886\nCyber Event impact (225) (156) 554 415\nRestructuring, asset impairment, severance, and\nother, net 562 (232) 1,070 131\nAOI $ 77,214 $ 31,402 $ 58,621 $ 16,805\n23\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 11 – SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nSupplemental cash flow information for the nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 is presented in the\nfollowing table:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\n(in thousands)\nCash paid for interest $ 13,659 $ 17,603\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds 25,905 17,588\nSee Note 7 entitled “Leases” for additional supplemental disclosures related to finance and operating leases.\n24\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 12 – INCOME TAXES\nThe Company determines its provision for income taxes for interim periods using an estimate of its annual effective tax\nrate (“AETR”) and records any changes affecting the estimated AETR in the interim period in which the change occurs,\nincluding discrete tax items.\nDuring the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company recorded a total income tax provision of $21.0 million on\npre-tax income of $86.2 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 24.4%, as compared to a total income tax provision of $11.7\nmillion on pre-tax income of $36.7 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 32.0% during the nine months ended October 1,\n2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the period ended September 29, 2024, as compared to the period ended\nOctober 1, 2023, was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on interest expense carryforwards, favorable\nchanges related to the limitation on the deduction of business interest expense under Internal Revenue Code section 163(j), an\nincrease in tax benefits related to share-based compensation, and prior period non-deductible charges related to the substantial\nliquidation of subsidiaries in Brazil and Russia that occurred during the nine months ended October 1, 2023. These favorable\nchanges were partially offset by a decrease in U.S. tax benefits related to foreign tax credit utilization, foreign derived\nintangible income, and the repatriation of previously taxed foreign earnings realized during the nine months ended October 1,\n2023.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published Pillar Two\nModel Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The\nOECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the\nPillar Two global minimum tax. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain\ncomponents of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption\nof additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. For fiscal year 2024, we\nexpect to meet the Transitional Country-by-Country (CbCR) Safe Harbor rules for most if not all jurisdictions and do not\nexpect these provisions to have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. We will continue to closely monitor\nongoing developments and evaluate any potential impact on future periods.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, the Company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by $0.4 million. As of\nSeptember 29, 2024, the Company had accrued approximately $5.3 million for unrecognized tax benefits. In accordance with\napplicable accounting standards, the Company’s deferred tax asset as of September 29, 2024, reflects a reduction of $2.8\nmillion of these unrecognized tax benefits.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances,\nincluding the progress of tax audits and the closing of statutes of limitations. While it is reasonably possible that some of the\nunrecognized tax benefits will be recognized within the next 12 months, the Company does not expect the recognition of such\namounts will have a material impact on the Company’s financial results.\n25\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 13 – ITEMS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nAmounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCL”), before tax, to the consolidated condensed\nstatements of operations during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023 are reflected in the\ntables below:\nThree Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1,\nStatement of Operations Location 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nLoss on foreign subsidiary liquidation(1) Other expense, net $ — $ (6,221)\nInterest rate swap contracts loss Interest expense — (196)\nAmortization of benefit plan net actuarial losses\nand prior service cost Other expense, net (379) (198)\nTotal loss reclassified from AOCL $ (379) $ (6,615)\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1,\nStatement of Operations Location 2024 2023\n(in thousands)\nLoss on foreign subsidiary liquidation(1) Other expense, net $ — $ (6,221)\nInterest rate swap contracts loss Interest expense — (982)\nAmortization of benefit plan net actuarial losses\nand prior service cost Other expense, net (1,124) (585)\nTotal loss reclassified from AOCL $ (1,124) $ (7,788)\n(1) The Company’s foreign subsidiaries in Russia and Brazil were substantially liquidated during the three months ended\nOctober 1, 2023, and the cumulative foreign currency translation losses associated with these entities were recognized in the\nconsolidated condensed statements of operations.

The gain\nattributable to the EAAA reportable segment was recorded in restructuring, asset impairment, and other gains, net, in the\nconsolidated condensed statements of operations.\nThe Company determined that the Thailand facility sale did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued\noperations.\n27\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, whether arising in the ordinary course of business or otherwise.

Consolidated operating income was $42.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $31.0 million in\nthe third quarter last year, primarily due to higher sales and higher gross profit margin as a result of higher sales volume, raw\nmaterial cost deflation, and favorable fixed cost absorption. Consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 29, 2024,\nwas $28.4 million or $0.48 per diluted share, compared to $9.9 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, we had consolidated net sales of $980.6 million, up 4.7% compared to $936.4 million\nin the first nine months of last year, primarily due to higher customer demand — particularly in the education, retail, and\nresidential living market segments partially offset by decreases in the healthcare and hospitality market segments. Consolidated\noperating income was $104.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $69.4 million in the same period last year,\nprimarily due to higher sales and higher gross profit margin as a result of higher average sales prices and raw material cost\ndeflation. Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, was $65.2 million or $1.11 per diluted\nshare, compared to $25.0 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the same period last year.\nCybersecurity Event\nAs previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 23, 2022, we\ndiscovered a cybersecurity attack on November 20, 2022, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT systems.\nThe investigation of the Cyber Event was completed in fiscal year 2023. We have cyber risk insurance and have recovered $0.5\nmillion of our costs and expenses during the nine months ended September 29, 2024. We anticipate that additional costs,\nexpenses or losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be recovered by insurance.\nImpact of Macroeconomic Trends\nRecent disruptions in economic markets due to inflation, high interest rates, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas\nwar, a fairly stabilized but still challenging supply chain environment, slow market conditions in certain parts of the globe, and\nsignificant financial pressures in the commercial office market globally, all pose challenges which may adversely affect our\nfuture performance. To mitigate these impacts, we plan to continue evaluating our cost structure and global manufacturing\nfootprint to identify and activate opportunities to decrease costs and optimize our global cost structure.\n30\nTable of Contents\nAnalysis of Results of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table presents, as a percentage of net sales, certain items included in our consolidated condensed statements\nof operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, September 29, October 1,\n2024 2023 2024 2023\nNet sales 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of sales 62.9 64.5 63.2 66.0\nGross profit 37.1 35.5 36.8 34.0\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 24.8 25.5 26.1 26.8\nRestructuring, asset impairment, and other gains, net — — — (0.3)\nOperating income 12.3 10.0 10.7 7.5\nInterest/Other expense, net 1.8 4.8 1.9 3.5\nIncome before income tax expense 10.5 5.2 8.8 4.0\nIncome tax expense 2.2 2.0 2.1 1.3\nNet income 8.3 % 3.2 % 6.7 % 2.7 %\nConsolidated Net Sales\nBelow is information regarding our consolidated net sales, and analysis of those results, for the three-month and nine-\nmonth periods ended September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, Percentage September 29, October 1, Percentage\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nConsolidated net sales $ 344,270 $ 311,006 10.7 % $ 980,648 $ 936,380 4.7 %\nFor the quarter ended September 29, 2024, consolidated net sales increased $33.3 million (10.7%) versus the comparable\nperiod in 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume (approximately 9%) and higher average sales prices (approximately 2%).\nCurrency fluctuations had a positive impact on consolidated net sales of approximately $1.4 million (0.4%) for the third quarter\nof 2024, due primarily to the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, and British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. On\na market segment basis, the sales increase was primarily in the retail, education, corporate office, residential living, and public\nbuildings market segments partially offset by decreases in the hospitality and healthcare market segments.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, consolidated net sales increased $44.3 million (4.7%) versus the\ncomparable period in 2023, primarily due to higher volume (approximately 3%) and higher average sales prices (approximately\n2%). Currency fluctuations had a negative impact on consolidated net sales of approximately $0.7 million (0.1%) for the first\nnine months of 2024, due to the weakening of the Chinese Renminbi, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar against the U.S.\ndollar partially offset by the strengthening of the British Pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the\nsales increase was primarily in the education, retail, residential living, and public buildings market segments partially offset by\ndecreases in the healthcare and hospitality market segments.\n31\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Cost and Expenses\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses for the three-\nmonth and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, Percentage September 29, October 1, Percentage\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nConsolidated cost of sales $ 216,645 $ 200,748 7.9 % $ 620,005 $ 618,463 0.2 %\nConsolidated selling,\ngeneral and administrative\nexpenses 85,450 79,273 7.8 % 255,871 251,049 1.9 %\nConsolidated Cost of Sales\nFor the quarter ended September 29, 2024, consolidated cost of sales increased $15.9 million (7.9%) compared to the third\nquarter of 2023, primarily due to higher sales partially offset by raw material cost deflation and favorable fixed cost absorption.\nCurrency translation had a negative impact on consolidated cost of sales in the third quarter of 2024 and partially increased our\ncosts by approximately $0.9 million (0.4%) compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, our cost of\nsales decreased to 62.9% for the third quarter of 2024 versus 64.5% for the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, consolidated cost of sales increased $1.5 million (0.2%) versus the\ncomparable period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales partially offset by raw material cost deflation. Currency translation\nhad a positive impact on consolidated cost of sales for the first nine months of 2024 and partially reduced our costs by\napproximately $0.6 million (0.1%) compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, our cost of sales\ndecreased to 63.2% for the first nine months of 2024 versus 66.0% for the first nine months of 2023.\nConsolidated Gross Profit\nFor the quarter ended September 29, 2024, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 37.1% compared with 35.5% in\nthe same period last year. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower costs (approximately 2%) driven\nby raw material cost deflation and lower fixed costs per unit due to higher volume.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 36.8% compared with 34.0%\nin the same period last year. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to raw material cost deflation\n(approximately 2%) and higher average sales prices (approximately 1%).\nConsolidated Selling, General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses\nFor the quarter ended September 29, 2024, consolidated SG&A expenses increased $6.2 million (7.8%) versus the\ncomparable period in 2023. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on consolidated SG&A expenses in the third quarter\nof 2024 compared to the same period last year. SG&A expenses were higher for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to\nhigher people costs of $5.7 million driven by increased variable compensation as a result of higher operating income compared\nto the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 24.8% for the third quarter of 2024\nversus 25.5% for the third quarter of 2023.\nFor the nine months ended September 29, 2024, consolidated SG&A expenses increased $4.8 million (1.9%) versus the\ncomparable period in 2023. Currency translation had no material impact on consolidated SG&A expenses in the first nine\nmonths of 2024 compared to the same period last year. SG&A expenses were higher for the first nine months of 2024 primarily\ndue to (i) higher people costs of $12.2 million driven by the factors discussed above for the current quarter, partially offset by\n(ii) lower professional fees of $3.6 million primarily due to lower non-recurring consulting expenses, (iii) lower severance costs\nof $2.8 million driven by employee headcount reduction and cost saving initiatives in the prior year period, and (iv) lower\nCyber Event costs of $1.4 million due to completion of the investigation in the prior year. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A\nexpenses decreased to 26.1% for the first nine months of 2024 versus 26.8% for the first nine months of 2023.\n32\nTable of Contents\nAssets Disposed\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company completed the sale of its Thailand manufacturing facility and recognized\na gain of $2.7 million.\nSee Note 14 entitled “Assets Disposed” of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\nOther Expense, net\nDuring the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company received insurance proceeds of approximately $2.4\nmillion related to a property casualty loss that occurred in fiscal year 2023. The insurance proceeds were recognized in other\nexpense, net, in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. During the quarter ended October 1, 2023, the Company\nsubstantially liquidated its foreign subsidiaries in Brazil and Russia and $6.2 million of cumulative translation adjustments were\nreclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated condensed\nstatements of operations.\nInterest Expense\nDuring the quarter ended September 29, 2024, interest expense was $5.7 million, a decrease of $2.4 million from the\ncomparable period in 2023, primarily due to lower outstanding term loan borrowings under the Facility. For the nine months\nended September 29, 2024, interest expense was $18.3 million, a decrease of $6.7 million from the comparable period in 2023,\nprimarily due to lower outstanding term loan borrowings as discussed above.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, was 21.2% and 24.4%, respectively,\ncompared to 38.7% and 32.0% for the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 was positively impacted by the\nrelease of a valuation allowance on interest expense carryforwards, utilization of previously unrealized interest expense\ncarryforwards and an increase in tax benefits related to share-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. tax\nbenefits related to foreign tax credit utilization, foreign derived intangible income, and the repatriation of previously taxed\nforeign earnings. The effective tax rate for 2023 was negatively impacted by the limitation on the deductibility of interest\nexpense under Internal Revenue Code section 163(j) and non-deductible charges related to the substantial liquidation of\nsubsidiaries in Brazil and Russia.\nSegment Operating Results\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a cost center realignment initiative to centralize certain global/\nshared functions. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, SG&A expenses for these global support functions\nwere allocated to adjusted operating income (“AOI”) for each reportable segment consistent with the allocation methodology\nused to allocate corporate overhead in prior periods. Prior year AOI amounts below were not recast as there was no material\nimpact to the measure of segment profit for each reportable segment. There were no changes to the composition of the\nCompany’s operating or reportable segments.\nAMS Segment – Net Sales and AOI\nThe following table presents AMS segment net sales and AOI for the three-month and nine-month periods ended\nSeptember 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023:\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, October 1, Percentage September 29, October 1, Percentage\n2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change\n(in thousands) (in thousands)\nAMS segment net sales $ 210,155 $ 178,194 17.9 % $ 595,082 $ 548,716 8.4 %\nAMS segment AOI(1) 32,187 23,318 38.0 % 77,214 58,621 31.7 %\n(1) Includes allocation of corporate SG&A expenses and allocation of global support SG&A expenses as discussed above.

Currency\nfluctuations had a positive impact on EAAA sales of approximately $1.6 million (1.2%) for the third quarter of 2024 compared\nto the same period last year due to the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, and the British Pound sterling against the\nU.S. dollar. On a market segment basis, the EAAA sales increase was primarily in the education and residential living market\nsegments partially offset by decreases in the hospitality and corporate office market segments.\nDuring the first nine months of 2024, net sales in EAAA decreased 0.5% versus the comparable period in 2023, primarily\ndue to lower sales volume. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on EAAA sales for the first nine months of 2024\ncompared to the same period last year. On a market segment basis, the EAAA sales decrease was primarily in the public\nbuildings, hospitality, and healthcare market segments partially offset by increases in the corporate office, education, and\nresidential living market segments.\nAOI in EAAA increased 24.9% during the third quarter of 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to\nhigher gross profit driven by raw material cost deflation. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on EAAA AOI for the\nthird quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year. As a percentage of net sales, AOI increased to 8.4% during the\nthird quarter of 2024 compared to 6.8% in the same period last year.\nAOI in EAAA increased 86.9% during the first nine months of 2024 versus the comparable period in 2023, primarily due\nto higher gross profit driven by raw material cost deflation.

As a percentage of net sales, AOI increased to 8.1% during the\nfirst nine months of 2024 compared to 4.3% in the same period last year.\n34\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nAt September 29, 2024, the Company had $115.6 million in cash. At that date, the Company had $41.2 million in term loan\nborrowings, no revolving loan borrowings, and $0.7 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Facility, and we had\n$300.0 million of Senior Notes outstanding. As of September 29, 2024, we had additional borrowing capacity of $299.3 million\nunder the Facility. We anticipate that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our obligations for the next 12 months, and we expect to\ngenerate sufficient cash to meet our long-term obligations.\nThe Senior Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Company’s material domestic\nsubsidiaries, all of which also guarantee the obligations of the Company under its Facility. The Company’s foreign subsidiaries\nand certain non-material domestic subsidiaries are considered non-guarantors. Net sales for the non-guarantor subsidiaries were\napproximately $149 million and $427 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024,\nrespectively, and net sales for the non-guarantor subsidiaries were approximately $148 million and $431 million for the three-\nmonth and nine-month periods ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Total indebtedness of the non-guarantor subsidiaries was\napproximately $130 million and $133 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nBalance Sheet\nAccounts receivable, net, were $173.9 million at September 29, 2024, compared to $163.4 million at December 31, 2023.\nThe increase of $10.5 million was primarily due to the impact of higher net sales as a result of increased customer demand in\n2024.\nInventories, net, were $283.1 million at September 29, 2024, compared to $279.1 million at December 31, 2023. The\nincrease of $4.0 million was primarily due to finished goods inventory build attributable to higher expected customer demand in\nthe remainder of 2024, partially offset by lower raw material costs.\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and\nOctober 1, 2023, respectively:\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 29, 2024 October 1, 2023\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 110,387 $ 114,217\nInvesting activities (16,694) (10,645)\nFinancing activities (89,545) (80,847)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash 955 (656)\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents 5,103 22,069\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 110,498 97,564\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 115,601 $ 119,633\nCash provided by operating activities was $110.4 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which represents\na decrease of $3.8 million from the prior year comparable period. Higher sales during the first nine months of 2024 contributed\nto higher accounts receivable balances resulting in a use of cash for the current period. The prior year comparable period\nincludes a source of cash from accounts receivable collections compared with the first nine months of 2024, primarily\nattributable to delays in customer billings from the Cyber Event, in which those delayed billings were collected in the first\nquarter of 2023. Additionally, the increase in inventories during the first nine months of 2024, as described above, resulted in a\ngreater use of cash compared with the same period in the prior year.\n35\nTable of Contents\nCash used in investing activities was $16.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which represents an\nincrease of $6.0 million from the prior year comparable period. The increase was attributable to higher capital expenditures\npartially offset by cash proceeds received during the first nine months of 2024 from the sale of manufacturing equipment and\ninsurance proceeds for property casualty losses. The first nine months of 2023 include cash proceeds of approximately $6.6\nmillion from the sale of the Company’s Thailand manufacturing facility.\nCash used in financing activities was $89.5 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which represents an\nincrease of $8.7 million from the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher prepayments\nof term loan borrowings during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period.\nOutlook\nCash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and\nsufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company’s cash flows from operations can be affected by\nnumerous factors including raw material availability and cost, and demand for our products.\nBacklog\nAs of October 20, 2024, the consolidated backlog of unshipped orders was approximately $242.3 million. As disclosed in\nour Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, backlog was approximately $195.5 million as of\nFebruary 4, 2024. Disruptions in supply and distribution chains have resulted in delays of construction projects and flooring\ninstallations in many regions worldwide, which have also caused, and may continue to cause, fluctuations in our backlog.\n36\nTable of Contents\nITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe discussion below in this Item 3 is based upon the more detailed discussions of our market risk and related matters\nincluded in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under Part II, Item 7A of that Form\n10-K. The discussion here focuses on the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and any material changes from (or other\nimportant intervening developments since the time of) the information discussed in that Form 10-K. This discussion should be\nread in conjunction with that Form 10-K for more detailed and background information.\nSensitivity Analysis\nFor purposes of specific risk analysis, we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the\nfair values of our market sensitive instruments. To perform sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values\nassociated with the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive\ninstruments.\nBecause the debt outstanding under our Facility has variable interest rates based on an underlying prime lending rate,\nSOFR, or other benchmark rate, we do not believe changes in interest rates would have any significant impact on the fair value\nof that debt instrument. Changes in the underlying prime lending rate, SOFR, or other benchmark rate would, however, impact\nthe amount of our interest expense. For a discussion of these hypothetical impacts on our interest expense, please see the\ndiscussion in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAs of September 29, 2024, based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates, with all other\nvariables held constant, the fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of $10.6 million.\nConversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long-term\ndebt of $7.0 million.\nAs of September 29, 2024, a 10% decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S.\ndollar, with all other variables held constant, would result in a respective decrease or increase in the net fair value of our\nfinancial instruments of $12.9 million. As the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net foreign\ninvestments is not included in the sensitivity model, these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign currency\nexchange risk.\n37\nTable of Contents\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was performed under the\nsupervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Act”), pursuant to Rule 13a-14(c)\nunder the Act.\nNo system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the\nsystem of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has\noperated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and procedures however are designed to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.\nBased on the evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nconcluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly\nReport to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n38\nTable of Contents\nPART II - OTHER INFORMATION\nITEM 1.

Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you Christine, and good morning everyone. To begin our call, I want to thank the Interface team for\nan impressive quarter. Our strong results reinforce the fact that our One Interface strategy is working and\nyielding tangible results.\nThe strategy is focused on building strong global functions to support our world-class local selling\nteam, accelerating growth through enhanced productivity of our commercial team, expanding margins\nthrough global supply chain management and complexity reduction and leading in design, innovation and\nsustainability. We're in the early stages of our multi-year plan and we're encouraged by the results we're\nseeing across the business.\nWe've talked about the new integrated selling approach that we implemented in Q1 of this year, which\ncombines nora and Interface selling teams in the U.S. These coordinated teams are continuing to yield\ntremendous results in the Americas business, resulting in currency-neutral net sales, up an impressive\n18% in the quarter.\nWe're seeing momentum in nora rubber sales expanding beyond healthcare into other growth segments\nincluding education, biopharma and manufacturing. Our combined selling teams are effectively unlocking\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc.

This is what\nwe'd hope to see and we're encouraged by the team's progress.\nAdditionally, we recently added the nora brand to our refreshed brand attitude Made for More. This\nplatform brings our brands closer together to drive consistency in how we show up for our customers.\nIt creates efficiency in our marketing and brand efforts and ultimately provides additional sales\nopportunities.\nTurning to our financial results. We delivered a very strong third quarter with currency-neutral net sales\ngrowth of 10% and significant profitability expansion. We continue to drive strong momentum in the\nAmericas, and as mentioned, currency-neutral net sales were up 18% year-over-year, continued market\nshare gain.\nIn EAAA, currency-neutral net sales were flat as growth in EMEA was largely offset by lower net sales in\nAustralia. Additionally, billings in all product [ categories ] were up year-to-date in both price and volume,\nwhich is a great testament to our selling organization and their ability to execute and gain share.\nMoving to our market segments, global education billings remain strong, up 18% year-over-year, led by\nstrength in the Americas. Our expanded Open Air collection, nora rubber and 3-millimeter LVT collection\ncontinue to resonate with our K-12 and higher education customers. This is a great example of our\ncombined selling teams effectively supporting our customers across the full product portfolio.\nGlobal Corporate Office billings, were up 2% year-over-year where we continue to gain market share when\nyou compare us with overall industry trends. As companies return to the office and update their spaces,\nour sales team leverages their deep relationships with architects and design firms to meet their needs with\nour differentiated product portfolio.\nOverall, activity continues to increase, particularly in Class A space where we are differentiated by our\npremium products, design and sustainability leadership.\nHealth care billings were soft in the third quarter, however, we saw strong double-digit year-over-year\norder growth. As a reminder, we typically have a longer sales and installation cycle related to our nora\nproducts in health care. And our strong healthcare orders will convert to billings in the coming quarters.\nAnd as expected, retail billings were up in the quarter compared to a soft prior year period. Retail is a\nsmall part of our overall net sales, but can have periodic unplanned deferrals of store remodel projects,\nwhich we experienced in the prior year period.\nTurning to orders, strong commercial execution drove a 10% increase in consolidated currency-neutral\norders in the third quarter. Currency-neutral orders in the Americas were up 17% with growth across all\nproduct categories. In EAAA, currency-neutral orders were flat year-over-year. Growth in Asia was largely\noffset by Australia with EMEA essentially flat.\nAs we head into the fourth quarter, our backlog is strong, up 29% year-to-date. We remain focused on\ncommercial productivity, improving the customer experience and aligning our sales teams with the fastest\ngrowing geographic markets and segments beginning in the U.S.\nTurning to supply chain and manufacturing. We continue to focus on reducing complexity through\nautomation in our manufacturing facilities. As previously mentioned, we will continue to implement new\nautomation and robotics solutions over the next 3 quarters. We are encouraged by the results of these\ninvestments in our U.S. manufacturing plants and continue to evaluate other automation opportunities,\nwhich will be funded through manufacturing efficiency savings.\nBefore Bruce gets into the financials, I want to share some notable accomplishments related to\nsustainability. First, we recently announced that we are making it easier for customers to understand the\ncarbon impact of their product selection. We are delivering embodied carbon metrics on all floor plans\ncreated by the Interface Design Studio by using a unique combination of technology and data to calculate\nthe carbon footprint of a project's flooring.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nThis helps to put carbon footprint data at the forefront where we know we lead with differentiated low\ncarbon products and it contributes to helping our customers achieve their own sustainability and carbon\ngoals.\nSecond, we've recently announced that we've expanded our carpet recycling capabilities at our facility in\nthe Netherlands, building on 30 years of progress in support of the circular economy. We can now process\nCQuest Bio and CQuest BioX backed carpet in EMEA to turn used products into new ones, helping us\nreduce our carbon footprint.\nThird, I'm pleased to share that Interface received the highest distinction in Reuters' recent Sustainability\nAwards in the Net Zero: Leadership category for our decision to go all in on becoming carbon-negative\nwithout offsets.\nAnd finally, I'm proud to report that Interface was added to Newsweek's Greenest Companies list, which\nis a ranking of top companies in the U.S. that are committed to environmental sustainability. Interface\ncontinues to be at the forefront of sustainability as we work to become carbon-negative by 2040, and we\nappreciate the recognition of our progress.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Bruce to go over the financials. Bruce.\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nWell thank you Laurel, and good morning everyone. Third quarter net sales totaled $344.3 million, an\nincrease of 11% versus the third quarter of 2023. Third quarter FX-neutral net sales in the Americas were\nup 18% year-over-year, driven primarily by strength in the education market segment as well as strong\nretail billings.\nFX-neutral net sales in EAAA were flat year-over-year and on an FX-neutral basis EMEA was up 2%, Asia\nwas down 1% and Australia was down 9% year-over-year on the strong prior year comparison.\nThird quarter adjusted gross profit margin was 37.5% on increase of 158 basis points on raw material cost\ndeflation and higher fixed cost absorption due to increased volume compared to the same period last year.\nAdjusted SG&A expenses were $85.5 million or 24.8% of net sales in the third quarter compared to $79.2\nmillion or 25.5% of net sales in the third quarter last year. Third quarter adjusted operating income was\n$43.5 million, up 34% versus adjusted operating income of $32.4 million in the third quarter last year. The\nincrease was driven by higher net sales and higher gross profit margins in the quarter.\nOur third quarter effective tax rate benefited from the release of a $2.7 million valuation allowance. This\nis driven by strong business performance in the U.S. and lower interest expense from accelerated debt\nrepayment. The release of this valuation allowance was unique to Q3 2024 and is not expected to recur.\nThird quarter adjusted EPS was $0.48 versus $0.28 in the third quarter last year. Third quarter's adjusted\nEBITDA was $53.7 million versus $43.7 million in the third quarter last year. We generated $76.2 million\nof cash from operating activities in the third quarter. In line with our capital allocation strategy, we repaid\n$51.3 million of debt in the third quarter and $80.9 million year-to-date.\nOur balance sheet remains strong with $415 million of liquidity at quarter end, and our net leverage ratio\nwas 1.1x calculated as net debt divided by the last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA. Capital expenditures\nwere $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $5.9 million in 2023.\nTurning to our outlook. We delivered impressive results in the third quarter of 2024 and enter fourth\nquarter with strong orders and a healthy backlog. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, gross\nprofit margin benefited 160 basis points from non-recurring items that reduced cost of sales in that\nquarter.\nSeparately, we continue to anticipate strong retail billings in the fourth quarter of 2024, which has slightly\nlower gross profit margins that are more typical premium products.\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nWith that backdrop in mind, we are raising our full year outlook and are now anticipating the following\nfor the full fiscal year 2024. Net sales of $1.315 billion to $1.325 billion; adjusted gross profit margin\nof approximately 36.6%; adjusted SG&A expenses of approximately $345 million; adjusted interest\nand other expenses of approximately $27 million; and adjusted effective tax rate for the full year of\napproximately 25%; fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 58.8 million shares and\ncapital expenditures of approximately $37 million.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Laurel for concluding remarks.\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThank you, Bruce. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and I would especially like to\nextend my thanks to the entire Interface team. Our results this quarter demonstrate the strength and\neffectiveness of our One Interface strategy, and I'm incredibly proud of the progress we've made across all\nareas of our business.\nAs we look ahead, our focus remains on investing in the business, operational excellence and delivering\nvalue to both our customers and shareholders. We are confident in our ability to navigate the dynamics of\nour current market while seizing opportunities that align with our long-term vision.\nWith that, I will open it up to questions. Operator?\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nQuestion and Answer\n....................................................................................................................................................................\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kathryn Thompson of TRG.\nKathryn Ingram Thompson\nThompson Research Group, LLC\nFirst, I want to focus on non-res repair and remodel, and we've heard very -- a few companies this\nearning season talk about an improvement in activity in non-res repair and remodel. And you seem to be\nseeing that as well, given the pace of orders in the past few quarters and bigger growth this quarter in\neducation and health care.\nHow would you characterize the state of non-res repair and remodel leading into 2025 and how does it\ncompare to going into the current year -- last year? So really what's the pace now going into next year\nand how does it compare to last year at the same time as you think about momentum?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks, Kathryn. First, I'd say I'm really proud of the progress that the teams made. 18% net sales\ngrowth in the Americas is a really, really strong quarter. And as you said, our order book also looks good.\nSo we're saying, I think we're definitely outpacing the market with respect to the total market. We're\nfeeling really good about the corporate environment is we're continuing to see more and more activity\nas people are bringing more associates back to work. So those projects are coming, I think, stronger\ncertainly than a year ago. Our optimism is building with respect to that.\nAs you said, our education business remains very strong as we're selling the full product portfolio, seeing\na lot of growth across our nora products as well in education, both in K-12 and higher ed. So I think we're\noptimistic that the momentum is building. And within that we are proud of the team's ability to take share.\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nKathryn, I agree. The other thing that's really interesting to me on our earnings this quarter is that, year-\nto-date all 3 product lines were up both in price and volume and we couldn't say that last year. So it's just\nanother testament to the momentum that we're seeing in the business, the momentum that we're seeing\nnow versus a year ago. So great momentum inside the business and great to see the volume up as well as\nus being able to hold price in the market.\nKathryn Ingram Thompson\nThompson Research Group, LLC\nAnd just a follow on to that on order growth in Americas, can you give any detail on the breakout across\nverticals or products? Is there anything that's leading the growth?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWe don't really -- yes, we don't give a ton of detail in that breakout. The one thing that we did mention in\nthe prepared remarks is that our health care orders were up double digits in the quarter, so we're feeling\noptimistic about that health care business. And those orders will read through over the coming quarter.\nSome of those take longer to read through, so that's good momentum for us in the future.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research.\nAlexander Peter Paris\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nCongratulations on another beat and raise.\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThanks Alex.\nAlexander Peter Paris\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nI just had a question kind of following up on Kathryn's regarding billing. So again, education was up very\nstrong, up 18%, Corporate Office was up 2% kind of bucking the industry trend, and you made some\nfavorable comments about return to office. I just thought whatever additional color I can get on those 2\ncategories, but also wanted to talk a little bit about retail and health care. So retail is finally up from down\nlast year due to project delays, so what's going on in retail? I'll start there.\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nOur retail business did come back as we had expected. And again, this was really project delays last year.\nSo in the back half of last year, we had several store remodels that were delayed and pushed into the\nback half of this year, and those read through in the quarter. If you look at the Americas business as an\nexample for that 18%, about 8 points of that growth was the retail comeback, which we had expected\nand then 10 points of growth across the rest of the market. So a strong quarter for retail, which is exactly\nwhat we had expected. We expect that also to carry somewhat forward into the fourth quarter.\nAnd then our Corporate Office business, it does continue to perform really well, was actually up mid-single\ndigits in the Americas. So even stronger than our -- globally our 2% growth. And our teams are really\nwinning projects, as Bruce said, across all categories. So they're doing an incredible job with these One\nInterface selling teams of selling the full suite of products across LVT carpet tile and also nora rubber. So\nstrong growth in corporate as well.\nAlexander Peter Paris\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nAnd then health care, you said that orders were up nicely, which is great. But revenue -- net sales were\ndown in health care slightly. What do you attribute that to?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, health care for us, those projects get installed over time, so the time horizon is a bit different. The\ndouble-digit order growth in health care is really encouraging and a testament to the team. Again, the\ncombined selling teams really focusing on the end market and we expect those orders to read through.\nThose projects get installed sometimes over 1 to 2 years.\nThe bigger projects and the orders come in in bigger chunks, but they also get the billings read through in\nbigger chunks over a longer period. So we're encouraged that we saw that level of net sales growth in the\nquarter while health care was not as strong. And then health care orders up, which shows that momentum\nwill continue to read through in the future.\nAlexander Peter Paris\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nDoes that strength in orders in health care translate into higher net sales in health care in the fourth\nquarter?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nI would expect it to. I think it also will flow through into next year. So again, some of those projects are\nlike small medical buildings and those will turn in the quarter. Some of those projects are large health care\nsystems that may have multiple buildings and multiple floors that get installed over 12 to 18 months.\nAlexander Peter Paris\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nAnd then I might have missed it, but did you comment on billings across product categories? I think you\nsaid they were up year-to-date in all 3, carpet tile, LVT and rubber?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThat's right.\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nAlex, our billings were up with price and volume, which is a great sign in all 3 product categories year-to-\ndate,\nAlexander Peter Paris\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nWere they up in the third quarter or just up year-to-date or both?\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\n2 out of the 3 were up and they were up with volume. So, yes, that's again an encouraging sign that\nit's really encouraging to see how much volume has come back while we're able to hold price. So all\nencouraging stuff on the top line.\nAlexander Peter Paris\nBarrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division\nThen the final question from me. Great outperformance on the adjusted gross margin versus your\nguidance. I think you had guided to approximately 36%, it came in at 37.5%. What is your long-term\ntarget there? I think you want to get back to pre-COVID levels. What is that? And then how long will it\ntake you to get there? Is it like a 50 bps per year sort of thing, or is it faster, sooner?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAlex, you're right, exactly. Our ambition is to get back up to 38% to 38.5% and we're really encouraged\nby the progress that we're making. We haven't given a specific timeline. We're honestly just trying to get\nthere as fast as we can and again, encouraged by the progress.\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nI would just say, Alex, the good news is that, and you mentioned it. We brought up our gross profit\nmargins in Q4 and for the full year. So if you sort of think about our prior guide for Q4, it was around\n34.1%. We brought that up 80 basis points in Q4 to 34.9% as our midpoint guide. And for the full year,\nas you pointed out, our prior guide was 36% and now we brought it up to 36.6%. So really good strong\nmomentum on that gross profit line row.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of David MacGregor with Longbow Research.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nLongbow Research LLC\nCongratulations on all the progress, tremendous to see. I guess, what percentage of wins at this point\nhave more than just carpet tile? So include the LVT and the nora versus how that KPI might've stood a\nyear ago or 18 months ago?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, it's a great question, David, and not something that we disclose regularly. I would say it's increasing\nfor sure. An example I would say is, in our education space where we had primarily -- initially we were just\nselling carpet tile into education. We broadened that nicely to include carpet tile and LVT as pretty\nstandard in selling to the education space.\nAnd what we're finding now is nora is also included in those both in K-12, but also in higher ed. So for\nexample, we're getting lab spaces and other spaces in higher ed, which we maybe hadn't had as part of\nthat portfolio in the past. So it's definitely increasing and encouraged by what we're seeing there. I think\nthere's more to go.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nAnd I guess, this is all just One Interface. It's not necessarily evolving preferences with the customer, it's\nmore you're taking share in those categories with an increasing presence?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, it's interesting, when we think about what we did with the One Interface selling teams, which hit,\nas you know, starting in January, part of that model was that we increased our feet on the street for our\nnora brand by about 20% to really round out the combined selling teams and make sure we had enough\ncoverage in nora to execute that model.\nWhat we're also seeing is that, we actually put the nora brand in the hands of all of our Interface sellers\nby changing our compensation structure so that now we're selling as one team and compensating as one\nteam. And so the energy around that -- rubber is a great solution for a lot of flooring opportunities and\nwe've really got an amplified effort across our entire Interface selling team in addition to that increase in\nfeet on the street specific to nora. So we're really seeing a multiplier effect there that's stronger than we\nanticipated.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nAnd so with the growth in nora, and just in terms of penetrating your existing base, and then in addition\nto that, you're talking about growth beyond health care, how do you stand in terms of available capacity\nin nora? Do you have capacity to support and how much growth and when do you have to start deploying\ncapital to expand that?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nYes, it's a great question and we're talking a lot about that. I think the good news right now is we invested\nin some automation equipment in nora that is live now, that's really helping us to increase our throughput.\nSo we have what we need. I think we'll continue to invest in that space and you may see some additional\ninvestments in nora as we continue to grow.\nBut we're continuing to, kind of, bring on more and more people to support the growth and also continue\nto invest in automation. So I think we're in good shape. We're talking about it every day.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nOn the raw materials, how much of the benefit that you achieved -- well, first of all, maybe can you just\ntalk about what price cost might have contributed to the gross margins?\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nYes, David, it was a blend between -- if you look at the 158 basis points of gross margin expansion in Q3,\nit was a blend of raw material cost deflation and also higher fixed cost absorption or lower cost per unit on\nhigher volume. And part of the contribution of that was that we actually beat our revenue number in Q3.\nSo compared to where we thought we would be in Q3, we had more throughput through the plants, which\nhelped us a lot on our fixed cost absorption.\nAnd on the raw side, things are leveling out from a inflation, deflation standpoint, but we did get little bit\nof year-over-year lift in Q3 that will start to moderate as we move into Q4. And all of that's built toward\nguide.\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAnd David, I'd just add to that also. When our Americas business is up 18%, that regional mix impact also\nhelps us so that flows through as a benefit as well.\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nThat's true.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nI guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much benefit there is from just movement in the raw material\nmarkets themselves in terms of the price you're paying for these factors versus some of the benefit\nassociated with bringing on a new supply chain leader and really getting much more process-oriented\naround procurement?\nBruce A. Hausmann\nVP & CFO\nI think it's a combination of all those things. And you put all of those positive pieces in and it blends into\nthe 158 bps, as Laurel mentioned. Laurel had a really good point that the geographic mix helped us a lot\nas well, offset a little bit by the retail mix. So there is a lot of pieces in there.\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAnd I think a lot of the things that we're seeing with respect to our investments in automation are yet to\ncome. As we've said, I'm pleased with the progress. We now have, I think, it's 3 machines up and running.\nMaybe the fourth is live by now in our Georgia facility that'll really help with the automation there, but\nthat's going to continue to play out over the next year.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nAnd that's versus I think you had one line up and running last quarter?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nThat's right, David.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nCopyright © 2024 S&P Global Market Intelligence, a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\nINTERFACE, INC. FQ3 2024 EARNINGS CALL NOV 01, 2024\nSo good progress there. I guess just thinking through to 2025, and I'm not sure -- obviously, there's a\nlot of uncertainty still remaining with regard to what '25 may bring. But I'd be interested in your thoughts\nin terms of your ability to maintain kind of a gross margin progression, not so much based on what the\nmarket may bring, because as we've said, that's uncertain. But just based on the idiosyncratic drivers that\nyou've got in place, the automation, the procurement, the One Interface initiatives, what do you think that\ncould contribute to gross margin progression as you move into the next year?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAs we've said, our ambition, as you know, is to get back to 38% and 38.5%. I think from a timing\nstandpoint this year, I think we'll be ahead of where we thought. So I'm encouraged by that and yet we\nstill have a lot yet to deploy that I don't think is reading through the P&L yet. So I'm encouraged that we'll\ncontinue to make progress.\nAnd as you said, the market will ride that and see where that takes us. But through all of this, we've just\nsaid we're going to not pay so much attention to what the market is doing, we're going to do everything\nwe can to continue to drive market share gains and growth which -- and then also the supply chain\ninitiatives all that is within our control to drive that. So I think we're feeling good.\nDavid Sutherland MacGregor\nLongbow Research LLC\nAnd then just wrapping up for me, I guess the question on SG&A. You're guiding to $345 million this\nyear of SG&A. I guess a couple of questions here. How much revenue growth can you support based on\nkind of that level of spend? I'm guessing you're going to get some inflation there in 2025. 3% inflation\nwill be an extra $10 million, but maybe offset that with some productivity and maybe offset, increasing\ngrowth spending with cutbacks in non-growth, SG&A. I'm not sure how you approach that. But I guess the\nquestion is just how much upside is left in terms of your ability to grow revenue off SG&A before you have\nto really take SG&A to next level?\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nAs we've said, we've been really focused on being efficient in our SG&A and we'll make investments, very\nthoughtful and intentional investments that we believe will read through to growth. The great example of\nthat is adding the feet on the street to the nora business, which is paying back in dividends. And we're\nanalyzing all of that to see how much more do we need in 2025 to deliver the growth expectations that\nwe have for ourselves. And yet we'll be very diligent on anything that doesn't touch the customer, the\ninnovation or the product design and development.\nSo it's a dance as you know, right? We need to make sure that we fund the growth. We'll be really\nintentional. We do a lot of test and learn to see whether or not things pay back. So we're putting really\ngood money to work for us and then being really efficient on anything that doesn't touch the customer.\nOperator\nThere are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Laurel Hurd, CEO for closing\nremarks.\nLaurel M. Hurd\nPresident, CEO & Director\nWell, I want to thank the entire Interface team for an excellent quarter. Congratulations to the team and\nthanks everyone for listening to the call and have a great day.\nOperator\nThank you. This does conclude today's conference call.

We continued to build on our strong foundation and\nleverage our expertise from around the world to drive environmental impact reductions, cultivate social responsibility, and maintain\nrobust governance practices.\nLast year marked a remarkable milestone in our company’s history – our 50th anniversary. In 1973, our founder, Ray Anderson,\nchallenged the status quo of the flooring industry, creating a company that reflected his desire to push the limit of what was\npossible. Today, we honor his legacy through our relentless pursuit of innovation, ongoing commitment to be the best in design,\ndedication to delivering performance excellence, and progress toward becoming a restorative enterprise.\nOur 2023 Impact Report is tangible proof of the power of our purpose-driven culture and exceptional team. Collectively, we strive\nto do the right thing every day and to be generous to people and the planet. In 2023 we launched our One Interface strategy,\nwhich moved us to a more coordinated global operating model. The strategy is working, enabling a more collaborative approach\nto how we work across the enterprise.\nWe continued to accelerate progress toward our ambitious climate goals and drive carbon emission reductions across our\nproducts, operations, and supply chain, making impressive strides toward our 2030 science-based targets.\nBy focusing on our values and activating programs and initiatives in response to employee feedback, we are fostering an\nequitable and inclusive culture where employees feel empowered to bring their whole selves to work every day.\nWe have positive momentum moving forward and remain focused on leveraging the power of our global company to drive\nsustainable growth and value for all of our stakeholders. We’re excited about the next 50 years at Interface.\nLaura Hurd, President & Chief Executive Officer\n2023 Impact Report Page 3\nIntroduction Environmental Stewardship Social & Community Impact Governance, Compliance & Ethics Appendix\nInterface At A Glance Who We Are\nInterface, Inc., (NASDAQ: TILE) is a global flooring solutions company and sustainability Leading\nleader, offering an integrated portfolio of carpet tile and resilient flooring products that\nprovider of commercial flooring: carpet tile, rubber, and LVT\nincludes Interface® carpet tile and luxury vinyl tile (LVT), nora® rubber flooring, and FLOR®\npremium area rugs for commercial and residential spaces.

We’ve constantly challenged the idea of business-as-usual, asking\nourselves how we can further reduce our environmental impact and make progress toward our climate goals. For\nthree decades, we’ve focused on transforming our business to become restorative. This has challenged us to think\ndifferently and address environmental impacts across every aspect of our business.\n2023 was another step in the right direction as we continue to work toward our ambitious climate goals and reduce the impact of\nour products and operations around the world. We realigned and solidified the structure of our Global Sustainability team, which\nwill help ensure we are well-positioned to make progress toward our sustainability objectives. We also introduced our inaugural\nGlobal Sustainability Council, a passionate, cross-functional global team that will help us accelerate our progress and explore new\npathways to becoming a carbon negative enterprise by 2040.\nIn 2024, we’re commemorating the 30th anniversary of founder Ray Anderson’s “spear in the chest moment,” which changed\neverything for Interface. This was when the seeds of sustainability were first planted at Interface, and they quickly grew to define\nwho we are as a company.\nWith Ray in mind, we recently announced a bold step on our journey to become carbon negative by focusing on direct carbon\nreductions – not offsets – to meet the urgency of the climate crisis.

manage risks materials and finished products. Interface’s goal is to have no chemicals of concern in our entire\nand/or hazards associated portfolio of products.\nwith chemicals in products\nInterface determines chemicals of concern based on a rigorous review of medical and scientific\nliterature, regulations, and market trends and adopts global goals for their substitution and phase out\nfor all product lines. Using this approach, Interface has phased out the use of numerous categories of\nchemicals including the elimination of ortho-phthalate esters, formaldehyde, fluorocarbons (including\nPFAS) and flame retardants.\nIn 2021, Interface eliminated several materials from our product portfolio, including fly ash, as well as\nseveral materials in our rubber and resilient product group. In 2021, our European business eliminated\nits bitumen-based backing system for carpet tiles, replacing those virgin petroleum derived materials\nwith biobased materials. In 2021, Interface also made progress to reduce virgin raw materials used\nin the backing of our carpet tile products and replaced them with recycled and biobased materials.\nTo achieve this, Interface created and launched a new standard backing system which has 99%\ncombined biobased and recycled content.\nPercentage of eligible products CG-BF-250a.2 All Interface flooring products (100%) meet indoor air quality standards for low VOC emissions.

Interface leads the industry in the\nby UL and IBU\nsustainable products adoption and use of EPDs for product disclosures and our full product portfolio is covered by EPDs.\nEPDs show the progress Interface has made to reduce the environmental impacts of our products\nusing various strategies including: reducing the energy used to manufacture products, using\nrenewable energy to make products, the use of recycled materials, and the reduced use of chemicals\nof concern in products. All EPDs are publicly available and are published on company websites.\nInterface has significantly reduced the carbon footprint of our products. As of 2023, the global sales\nweighted average product carbon footprint (cradle-to-gate) was 3.7 kg CO2e/m2 for our carpet tile\nproducts, 8.0 kg CO2e/m2 for nora rubber and for 8.9 kg CO2e/m2 for our LVT flooring.\nInterface’s ReEntry program collects used carpet tile for reuse and recycling. Since 2016, we have\nrecovered over 75 million pounds of post-consumer carpet through our global ReEntry programs.\nFrom that total, 56 million pounds were given a second life through recycling internally or reused/\nrecycled through one of our ReEntry partners.\nWood Supply Chain Management (1) Weight of end-of-life CG-BF-410a.2 1) In 2023, Interface recovered 5.7 million pounds, or 2,568 metric tonnes of post-consumer carpet\nmaterial recovered through its global ReEntry program.
