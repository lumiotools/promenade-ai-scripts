The aim of the relationship is to develop intellectual property specifically for\nsourcing and the refining of mined feedstock and ores containing gold, silver, and platinum group metals\n(or PGMs) that is expected to be more environmentally sensitive and lower cost than traditional methods.\nIn return and as consideration of funding the development, the Company will earn a royalty stream from\nall refined products sold utilizing the developed intellectual property and patents.\nReElement Technologies Corporation has previously pioneered development of the refining of other critical\nminerals and metals through low-cost methods that involve innovative technologies that are changing the\nway industries are approaching metal and elemental refining. Royalty Management has agreed to provide\nfunding for new technology development outside their current intellectual property to refine Platinum\nGroup Metals (PGM), gold, and silver in what is expected to be a substantially lower cost and more\nenvironmentally sensitive method than the traditional methods for processing and refining these ores.\nFurthermore, the Company has entered into a strategic cooperation agreement with LVC Global, an energy,\nnatural resources, and infrastructure asset acquisition and advisory firm, to assist Royalty Management in\nsourcing mining operations and reserves containing elements in PGM, gold, and silver, while creating new\nmarket opportunities in this space. LVC Global has decades of experience in sourcing and conducting due\ndiligence of mining assets that will complement Royalty Management’s deployment and scaling of the\nintellectual property being developed under this program.\nThomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “Our teams our obviously very close and\nhave jointly seen the need for a better and lower cost refining in the gold, silver and PGM marketplace. By\npartnering with both LVC Global and ReElement for these specific feedstocks, we can lean on each other\nto efficiently develop the process, source the feedstock and deploy the process throughout the globe. At\nRoyalty, alongside LVC Global, we are looking at several very attractive feedstock relationships, but it\nalways comes down to the refining process being the limiting factor to viable projects in the gold, silver\nand PGM marketplace. Ourselves and the mutual teams are confident that with the funding provided by\nRoyalty we can develop this process quickly and efficiently for commercial applications in the gold and\nsilver space but also the defense sector.”\nSauve continued, “As one can imagine, there is an immense number of mining projects that have high-\nquality resources that contain PGM, gold, and silver but are inhibited from extraction due to other logistics\nor impediments to their production. This technology will change the game on that front: we can build\nalongside mining operations to increase the value of the production by refining to very high purity locally,\ncreating substantial value for the operators. Furthermore, being a generally lower-cost and more\nenvironmentally friendly method of purification of elements, our technology will also enable the more\nefficient extraction of PGM, gold, and silver from resources and reserves, thereby opening up a larger\nmarket of otherwise unmerchantable or unprofitable operations. With such a large addressable market,\neven a small deployment of this developing technology to mining companies has the ability to translate into\nlarge royalties and returns for Royalty Management.”\nC. Derek Campbell, Executive Chairman of LVC Global stated, “We are excited to partner with Royalty\nManagement and ReElement to find ways to monetize this newly developed IP within our network of\ninternational mine owners and operators. With our experience in this sector, we are eager to activate this\npartnership with Royalty Management and see this as a long-term value creation for both of our companies.”\nThe intellectual property and patent development agreement with ReElement Technologies involves the\nfollowing:\n• Royalty Management will fund the development process of ReElement to develop environmentally\nsensitive and cost-effective intellectual property for the refining of such products.\n• Royalty Management will fund the IP and patent process post development.\n• For the capital provided, Royalty Management will earn a royalty stream from any revenues generated\nby any users of the intellectual property developed through Royalty Management’s investment and for\nthe gold, silver and PGM based feedstocks.\n• Royalty Management, LVC, and ReElement will source PGM, gold, and silver based feedstock where\nthe sourced product partners will leach the feedstock into a pregnant leach solution to be separated and\npurified by the developed IP.\nAbout Royalty Management Holding Corporation\nRoyalty Management Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: RMCO) is a royalty company building shareholder\nvalue to benefit both its shareholders and communities by acquiring and developing high value assets in\nsustainable market environments.

This transaction further positions the Company\nfor future growth and results in an increase of shareholder equity to $12.3 million.\nTo accomplish this effort, the Company’s board of directors recently approved the creation of a new class\nof preferred stock to enable the conversion of debts to equity to further strengthen its balance sheet. Thus\nfar, conversations with debt holders have been extremely positive, resulting in over half (approximately\n$1.6 million) of debt converted (out of $3.1 million total debt and liability at June 30, 2024) into the\npreferred stock. The preferred stock (known as the “Series A Preferred Stock”) converts, at the option of\nthe holder, into common stock of the company at $1.70 per share, a significant premium to the current\ncommon stock share price. The continued strengthening of the balance sheet will enable the Company to\nmore aggressively utilize future cashflows to focus on portfolio growth, expansion, stock repurchases, and,\nif authorized, future dividends.\nThomas Sauve, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “Having a strong balance sheet is\nimperative as we continue our growth as a business.

As part of this new initiative,\nthe Company will be selectively investing in certain raw and processed minerals and materials\nfrom various global sources, including those feedstocks produced by RMCO’s own portfolio\ncompanies, in negotiated transactions and offtake agreements that link producers with consumers\n(or refiners) of these mined or recycled materials and elements. The transactional nature of this\ndivision is structured to provide Royalty Management with a “cost-plus” investment model\ndesigned to also provide the Company with additional revenue potential from profit sharing\narrangements negotiated with the consumer or refiner of RMCO’s purchased feedstock, although\nother investment structures will be considered by management.\nThis new division of the Company is intended to be complimentary and synergistic to Royalty\nManagement’s existing and future investments in the critical mineral and infrastructure space by\nutilizing the Company’s relationships, network, balance sheet, trade financing and confidence in\nits own investments to help initiate or expand production from its portfolio holdings.\n“As discussed in the annual shareholder letter released earlier this year, one of our targeted themes\nfor investment by RMCO in the coming months and years is the resources, minerals, and materials\nneeded for the growing energy storage and infrastructure industries”, commented Tom Sauve,\nChief Executive Officer of Royalty Management Holding Corporation. “We have been executing\non this plan with our continued work with Ferrox Holdings, the owner of the Tivani Project in\nLimpopo, South Africa, a titanium, vanadium, and pig iron resource rich mine, and our recent\nroyalty investment into T.R. Mining, which holds the exclusive prospective rights to a large\nresource in Jamaica. While we continue to evaluate other exciting investments in this sector, we\nsaw the opportunity to not only provide a secondary source of capital to our existing and upcoming\ninvestments, but also another way to participate in this exciting segment of the resource space\nthrough select investment into the resources themselves. These investments will be structured\nthrough a combination of investment into the minerals produced by mining companies and a sale\nof this feedstock to end users and refiners, with our Company receiving additional margin and fees\non these transactions, while being synergistic and assisting our portfolio companies.\nConcurrent with the formation of this new investment division within Royalty Management, the\nCompany is excited to also announce its first executed agreement under this structure, whereby\nthe Company will be selectively purchasing raw feedstock for resale to ReElement Technologies\nCorporation, for use in their refining process. This innovative investment structure alongside the\ngrowing balance sheet strength of Royalty Management enables the Company to offer a variety of\nstrategic investment options, such as trade financing or commodity brokering, frequently at a lower\ncost than RMCO’s partners or customers can secure by themselves, ultimately making this\npartnership accretive for all parties while also enabling partner companies, such as ReElement\nTechnologies, to rapidly increase their feedstock source availability as they expand their refining\nproduction in Indiana and Kentucky.\nAbout Royalty Management Holding Corporation\nRoyalty Management Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: RMCO) is a royalty company building\nshareholder value to benefit both its shareholders and communities by acquiring and developing\nhigh value assets in sustainable market environments.

(Nasdaq: RMCO)\n(“Royalty Management” or the “Company”) an innovative royalty company building shareholder\nvalue by acquiring and developing high value assets in sustainable market environments, is pleased\nto provide an update to its investment in a state-of-the-art permanent magnet materials program\nwith Advanced Magnet Lab, Inc. (“AML”). The sponsorship is focused on the stand up of lab-\nscale capabilities for the development of proprietary metal alloy compositions that are used in the\nmanufacturing of permanent magnets.\n“We are excited to explore a new frontier for new alloys and material compositions for the creation\nof the next generation of permanent magnets and see the potential for many new markets based on\nour collaboration and investment with AML,” stated Thomas Sauve, CEO of RMCO. Mr. Sauve\ncontinued, “this lab will enable AML to begin exploring novel material compositions for\npermanent magnet applications with leading companies in defense, automotive, and general\nindustry. These capabilities will be key to reshoring a domestic supply chain of permanent magnet\nproduction within the United States, thereby reducing reliance on nations such as China.”\nThe strategic partnership between RMCO and AML began in December 2022, when RMCO\nengaged with AML to fund the setup and development of a pilot-scale lab for producing novel\nmetal alloys compositions for producing magnet powder. This relationship also provides RMCO\nwith a royalty interest in these novel compositions developed that are consumed in producing\npermanent magnets.\nAML is a leading developer of magnet-based technologies and has developed a novel process,\nPM-Wire™, for producing permanent magnets, which has been funded by the U.S. Department of\nDefense (DoD) and commercial partners. AML is presently being sought after to scale its\nmanufacturing process by several strategic partners across the United States.\nPM-Wire™ is a scalable and modular, manufacturing process, that has ability to produce non-\nsintered and sintered permanent magnets at a high-rate and high-yield from a variety of materials.\nThe process is adaptable to a variety of applications, including those that benefit from magnets in\nunique configurations and material compositions, such as electric motors. The added benefit of\nPM-Wire™ is that the process enables for magnets of equal or greater performance with much less\nemphasis on the grade or quality of the alloys produced. This has enabled the team to focus on\ncompositions that are less dependent on critical rare earth elements such as neodymium,\npraseodymium, and dysprosium, which are costly and difficult for suppliers to extract.\nThe collaboration between RMCO and AML, with the pilot-scale lab, is expected to begin\nproducing sintered and non-sintered magnet alloy samples in the first half of 2024 for prototyping\nwith AML’s PM-Wire™ process.\nRMCO and AML will continue to explore further business opportunities, including, but not limited\nto, additional material development programs and the commercial scale-up of metal alloys\nproduction capabilities.\nRMCO has funded this effort through an investment in AML with subscription to convertible notes\nunder the AML 2022 Convertible Note Round.\nTo learn more about the rapidly growing market for permanent magnets, please visit\nhttp://mitusmagnets.com for industry white papers and additional information.\nAbout Advanced Magnet Lab, Inc. (AML)\nFounded in 1995, AML is a recognized leader in the development of innovative magnet\ntechnologies and magnet-based applications.
