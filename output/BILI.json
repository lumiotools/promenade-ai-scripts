Gross profit margin reached 34.9%, improving from 25.0% in the same period last year.\n  * **Net loss** was RMB79.8 million (US$11.4 million), narrowing by 94% year over year.\n  * **Adjusted net profit****1** was RMB235.9 million (US$33.6 million), compared with an adjusted net loss of RMB863.5 million in the same period last year.\n  * **Operating cash flow** was RMB2.23 billion (US$317.1 million) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with RMB277.4 million in the same period last year.\n  * **Average daily active users (DAUs)** were 107.3 million, compared with 102.8 million in the same period last year.\n\n\n\n“This quarter, we sustained strong growth momentum across our community metrics and key business lines,” said Mr. Rui Chen, chairman and chief executive officer of Bilibili. “Both DAUs and MAUs hit record highs of 107 million and 348 million, respectively. Users' average daily time spent also reached a new high of 106 minutes, increasing by 6 minutes compared to the same period last year. With our thriving community and highly engaged user base, we are well-positioned to tap into greater user value through our diverse commercial offerings. Total revenues in the third quarter came in at RMB7.31 billion, increasing by 26% year over year. In particular, revenues from our mobile games and advertising businesses increased by 84% and 28% year over year, respectively. With our consistent effort in improving commercialization efficiency, we achieved our first non-GAAP net profit in this quarter. This milestone is just a new starting point. Going forward, we will further develop our commercial capabilities while reinforcing our community ecosystem, bringing long-term value to all of our stakeholders.”\n\nMr. Sam Fan, chief financial officer of Bilibili, said, “In the third quarter, robust growth in our high-margin mobile games and advertising businesses accelerated our total revenue growth and significantly expanded our margins. Our gross profit surged by 76% year on year and our gross profit margin rose considerably to 34.9%, up from 25.0% in the same period last year. Consequently, we recorded an adjusted operating profit of RMB272.2 million compared with a loss of RMB755.4 million from the same period of 2023. The significant improvement in our financials showed the elasticity of our business model, as well as the vast commercialization potential within our community. We will build on this landmark and continue to drive sustainable growth in the future.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results**\n\n**Total net revenues.** Total net revenues were RMB7.31 billion (US$1,041.0 million) in the third quarter of 2024, representing an increase of 26% from the same period of 2023.\n\n_Value-added services (VAS)_. Revenues from VAS were RMB2.82 billion (US$402.0 million), representing an increase of 9% from the same period of 2023, led by increases in revenues from live broadcasting and other value-added services.\n\n_Advertising._ Revenues from advertising were RMB2.09 billion (US$298.5 million), representing an increase of 28% from the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the Company’s improved advertising product offerings and enhanced advertising efficiency.\n\n_Mobile games._ Revenues from mobile games were RMB1.82 billion (US$259.7 million), representing an increase of 84% from the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the strong performance of the Company’s exclusively licensed game, _San Guo: Mou Ding Tian Xia_.\n\n_IP derivatives and others._ Revenues from IP derivatives and others were RMB567.3 million (US$80.8 million), representing a decrease of 2% from the same period of 2023.\n\n**Cost of revenues.** Cost of revenues was RMB4.76 billion (US$678.1 million), representing an increase of 9% from the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly due to higher revenue-sharing costs and was partially offset by lower content costs. Revenue-sharing costs, a key component of cost of revenues, were RMB2.91 billion (US$414.8 million), representing an increase of 19% from the same period of 2023, mainly due to the increase of mobile games-related revenue-sharing costs.\n\n**Gross profit.** Gross profit was RMB2.55 billion (US$363.0 million), representing an increase of 76% from the same period of 2023, mainly attributable to the growth in total net revenues, while costs related to platform operations remained relatively stable.\n\n**Total operating expenses.** Total operating expenses were RMB2.61 billion (US$372.5 million), representing an increase of 2% from the same period of 2023.\n\n_Sales and marketing expenses._ Sales and marketing expenses were RMB1.20 billion (US$171.3 million), representing a 21% increase from the same period of 2023.

The decrease was mainly attributable to higher termination expenses of certain game projects in the same period of 2023.\n\n**Loss from operations.** Loss from operations was RMB66.7 million (US$9.5 million), narrowing by 94% from the same period of 2023.\n\n**Adjusted profit/(loss) from operations****1****.** Adjusted profit from operations was RMB272.2 million (US$38.8 million), compared with an adjusted loss from operations of RMB755.4 million from the same period of 2023.\n\n**Total other (expenses)/income, net.** Total other expenses were RMB21.5 million (US$3.1 million), compared with RMB212.1 million in the same period of 2023.

The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures help identify underlying trends in its business by excluding the impact of share-based compensation expenses, amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, income tax related to intangible assets acquired through business acquisitions, gain/loss on fair value change in investments in publicly traded companies, and gain/loss on repurchase of convertible senior notes. The Company believes that the non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information about the Company’s results of operations, enhance the overall understanding of the Company’s past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company’s management in its financial and operational decision-making.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing the Company’s operating performance, cash flows or liquidity, investors should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for net loss, cash flows provided by operating activities or other consolidated statements of operations and cash flows data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\nThe Company mitigates these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP performance measures, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s performance.\n\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “Unaudited Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results.”\n\n**Exchange Rate Information**\n\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars (“US$”) at specified rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise stated, all translations from RMB to US$ were made at the rate of RMB7.0176 to US$1.00, the exchange rate on September 30, 2024 set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. The Company makes no representation that the RMB or US$ amounts referred to could be converted into US$ or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement**\n\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements.

Announces Repurchase Right Notification for 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026\n\nSHANGHAI, Oct. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bilibili Inc. (“Bilibili” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BILI and HKEX: 9626), an iconic brand and a leading video community for young generations in China, today announced that it is notifying holders of its 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (CUSIP No. 090040AF3) (the “Notes”) that, pursuant to the Indenture dated as of November 23, 2021 (the “Indenture”) relating to the Notes by and between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee, each holder has the right, at the option of such holder, to require the Company to repurchase all of such holder’s Notes or any portion thereof that is an integral multiple of US$1,000 principal amount for cash on December 1, 2024 (the “Repurchase Right”). Holders of the Notes may exercise the Repurchase Right from 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on Tuesday, October 29, 2024 until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, November 27, 2024.\n\nAs required by rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Company will file a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO today. In addition, documents specifying the terms, conditions, and procedures for exercising the Repurchase Right will be available through the Depository Trust Company and the paying agent, which is Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. None of the Company, its board of directors, or its employees has made or is making any representation or recommendation to any holder as to whether to exercise or refrain from exercising the Repurchase Right.\n\nThe Repurchase Right entitles each holder of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase all of such holder’s Notes, or any portion thereof that is an integral multiple of US$1,000 principal amount. The repurchase price for such Notes will be an amount in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, December 1, 2024, which is the date specified for repurchase in the Indenture (the “Repurchase Date”), subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture and the Notes. The Repurchase Date is an interest payment date under the terms of the Indenture and the Notes. As December 1, 2024 is a Sunday, pursuant to the Indenture and the Notes, on Monday, December 2, 2024, which is the next succeeding business day, the Company will pay accrued and unpaid interest on all of the Notes through November 29, 2024 to all holders who were holders of record as of close of business on Friday, November 15, 2024, regardless of whether the Repurchase Right is exercised with respect to such Notes, with the same force and effect as if paid on December 1, 2024 and no interest shall accrue in respect of the delay. As a result, on the Repurchase Date, there will be no accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes. As of October 21, 2024, there was US$432,407,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. If all outstanding Notes are surrendered for repurchase through exercise of the Repurchase Right, the aggregate cash purchase price will be US$432,407,000.\n\nIn order to exercise the Repurchase Right, a holder must follow the transmittal procedures set forth in the Company’s Repurchase Right Notice to holders (the “Repurchase Right Notice”), which is available through the Depository Trust Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. Holders may withdraw any previously tendered Notes pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Right at any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, November 27, 2024, which is the second business day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date. If a holder has tendered any Notes pursuant to the Repurchase Right, such Notes cannot be converted unless the holder withdraws the tender in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.\n\nThis press release is for information only and is not an offer to purchase, a solicitation of an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an offer to sell the Notes or any other securities of the Company. The offer to purchase the Notes will be only pursuant to, and the Notes may be tendered only in accordance with, the Company’s Repurchase Right Notice dated October 21, 2024 and related documents.\n\nHolders of the Notes should refer to the Indenture for a complete description of repurchase procedures and direct any questions concerning the mechanics of repurchase to the Trustee by contacting Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas. Holders of Notes may request the Company’s Repurchase Right Notice from the paying agent, at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, c/o DB Services Americas Inc., 5022 Gate Parkway Suite 200, MS JCK01-218, Jacksonville, FL 32256.\n\n**HOLDERS OF NOTES AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE URGED TO READ THE COMPANY’S TENDER OFFER STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE TO, REPURCHASE RIGHT NOTICE, AND OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT BILIBILI INC.

I will now turn the call to Mr. Chen.\nRui Chen - Bilibili Inc. - CEO\nThank you, Juliet, and thank you everyone, for participating in our third quarter 2024\nconference call to discuss our Oinancial and operating results. I’m pleased to deliver today’s\nopening remarks.\nThe third quarter of 2024 was a landmark quarter for Bilibili. We are excited to share that we\nachieved our Oirst quarterly adjusted net proOit while setting new records across our\ncommunity metrics. These milestones are a strong testament to our ability to deliver\nproOitable growth and the unique community value that we continue to unlock.\n1\nLooking at our Oinancials in more detail: total revenues in the third quarter accelerated, rising\nby 26% year over year, reaching RMB7.3 billion. Driven by our successful diversiOication into\nthe strategy game genre, games revenue led our growth, surging by 84% year over year.\nMeanwhile, our advertising business maintained its strong performance in the third quarter,\nrecording a 28% year-over-year increase. The increasing top-line contribution from our\nhigh-margin games and advertising business propelled our gross proOit up by 76% year over\nyear, driving our gross proOit margin jump to 34.9% from 25.0% in the same period last year.\nAs a result, we successfully exceeded our commitment to reaching breakeven in the third\nquarter, achieving an adjusted operating proOit of RMB272 million and an adjusted net proOit\nof RMB236 million.\nWhile making remarkable Oinancial progress, we continued to grow and cultivate our\ncommunity. Both DAUs and MAUs reached record highs in the third quarter, hitting 107\nmillion and 348 million, respectively. Meanwhile, the average daily time spent per user rose\nto a new high of 106 minutes. With robust user retention and engagement, our users have\nstayed with us and grown with the platform. The average age of Bilibili users is now 25. As\nthese users enter new life stages with increasing spending power, we will continue to curate\nmore diverse content and services that cater to their evolving needs.\nMoving ahead, we remain committed to building a welcoming and inspiring video\ncommunity with ‘all the videos you like.’ Our turn to proOitability marks a new starting point\nin our journey. We will continue to invest in key infrastructure that supports content creation\nand distribution, reinforcing our leading position in the high-quality video content space and\ncreating value for all our stakeholders.\nWith that overview, let’s look at our core content, community and commercialization\npillars in more detail.\nBeginning with content and community. In the third quarter, our average daily video views\nexceeded 5.7 billion, up 23% year over year. The growth reOlects the effectiveness of our\nstrategy to broaden content categories and encourage high-quality content creation. While\nour leading categories maintained their popularity, consumption-related categories\ncontinued rising. This is being driven by increasing user demand as the young generation\nbecomes the mainstream of consumer society. Video views in fashion, and home appliances\nand decoration grew by over 25% year over year, while views in automotive, baby and\nmaternity, sports and Oitness categories surged by more than 40% compared with the same\nperiod last year.\n2\nThe diverse commercialization channels we offer continue to empower our content creators\nto realize their commercial value while pursuing what they love. For the Oirst nine months of\n2024, nearly 2.7 million content creators received income through various channels on our\nplatform. Content creators’ total income through our various advertising and VAS products\ngrew by 24% during this period. Notably, content creators’ total income through our fan-\ncharging product saw an over 400% increase year over year in the same period.\nTurning to our community metrics. In the third quarter, our DAUs spent nearly 106 minutes\non our platform every day, compared with 100 minutes in the same period last year. Our\nmonthly interactions surpassed 19.3 billion, marking a 14% year-over-year increase. By the\nend of Q3, our ofOicial members grew to 251 million, with our 12-month retention rate\nremaining around 80%.\nAdditionally, our sponsored e-sports team, Bilibili Game, BLG, fought their way to second\nplace in the League of Legends S14 World Championship, marking a new record in the team’s\nhistory. We are proud of their achievement and look forward to their continued success in\nthe upcoming year. Events like these continue to support our leadership in the game\ncommunity and make Bilibili the top choice for young generations.\nLast but not least, we are excited to share that our MSCI ESG rating was upgraded to an “A”\nthis year – a testament to our steady ESG improvements over the past few years. This\nachievement underscores our dedication to advancing our ESG practices, where we use our\ninOluence to impact communities and society positively.\nNow, I’d like to talk about the progress of our commercialization in each of our\nbusiness lines.\nFirst, on our Games business. In the third quarter, our games revenues increased by 84%\nyear over year to RMB1.8 billion, driven by the outstanding performance of our strategy\ngame San Guo: Mou Ding Tian Xia (San Mou). The game’s initial performance reinforces our\nconOidence in the longevity of San Mou. We will continue to roll out new content updates and\ngameplay to deliver better gaming experiences to users.\nSan Mou's success shows the vast potential that lies within our game community. We plan to\nleverage our unique game industry advantage to further explore other game opportunities\nin different genres. Meanwhile, we remain committed to bringing the best ACG titles to our\nusers. Our legacy titles, FGO and Azur Lane, maintained their popularity as they celebrated\n3\ntheir 8th and 7th year anniversaries, respectively. In addition, we launched the Japanese RPG\ngame Jujutsu Kaisen: Phantom Parade 《咒术回战 幻影夜⾏》in overseas markets in\nNovember, which was well received.\nTurning to our Advertising business. Our advertising business continued to outperform\nthe industry in the third quarter. Advertising revenues increased by 28% year over year to\nRMB2.1 billion. Robust revenue growth in our performance-based ads was the largest\ncontributor, increasing nearly 50% year over year in the third quarter. We also achieved\ndecent year-on-year growth in brand and native ad revenues, reinforcing our strength in\nintegrated marketing capabilities.\nOur top Oive advertising industry verticals in the third quarter were games, e-commerce,\ndigital products and home appliances, internet services and automotive. As more and more\ne-commerce platforms recognized the commercial value of our unique young user base, they\nallocated larger advertising budgets to our platform. We saw a particular uptick over the\nsummer vacation and back-to-school season, resulting in an 80% year over year surge in e-\ncommerce advertising revenues. Meanwhile, we are also attracting more advertisers from\nemerging verticals. In the third quarter, ad revenues from education, baby and maternity,\nand travel and lodging all grew by over 100% year over year.\nIn addition, we continued to enhance our ad infrastructure to improve efOiciency, and we\nhave seen early beneOits from these efforts. For example, as we roll out a more user-friendly\nand effective ad placement system, the number of performance-based advertisers increased\nby over 40% year over year in the third quarter. We plan to further incorporate AI\ntechnologies into our smart ad delivery system and launch a series of tools for ad material\ncreation. With higher efOiciency and lower costs, these initiatives are expected to attract and\nretain more advertisers on our platform.\nTurning to our VAS business. Revenues from our VAS business increased by 9% year over\nyear to RMB2.8 billion in the third quarter. This quarter, we welcomed more users to join and\nenjoy our live broadcasting universe as we continued expanding our content offerings to\nmeet their diverse interests. Simultaneously, we remain focused on reOining our operations\nto ensure sustainable business growth while improving margins.\nOur premium membership program grew steadily year over year, reaching nearly 22.0\nmillion members in the third quarter. Over 80% of these members are on annual subscription\n4\nor auto-renewal packages. Additionally, other VAS products experienced rapid growth. Fan\ncharging revenues surged by over 500% year over year during the quarter, demonstrating\nour users’ strong willingness to pay for good content.\nAs we celebrate our Oirst quarter of proOitability, I want to thank our dedicated team, our loyal\nuser community, and our supportive partners and shareholders. Looking back over the past\n15 years, we’ve made signiOicant breakthroughs in our content offerings, expanded our user\nbase, and developed diverse commercialization products. These efforts have helped us build\na unique video community with a one-of-a-kind user experience in a competitive industry\nlandscape. Turning proOitable is just a new beginning. Building on this milestone, we will\ncontinue to reinforce our business's positive growth cycle to drive sustainable proOits in the\nfuture.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Sam to share more Oinancial details.\nSam Fan - Bilibili Inc. - CFO\nThank you, Mr. Chen.
