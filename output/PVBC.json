Provident Financial Services, Inc. Reports Third Quarter Earnings and Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend\n\nCompany Release - 10/29/2024 5:00 PM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nISELIN, N.J., Oct. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Financial Services, Inc. (NYSE:PFS) (the “Company”) reported net income of $46.4 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and net income of $28.5 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income totaled $67.0 million, or $0.65 per basic and diluted share, compared to $101.1 million, or $1.35 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe Company’s earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected the impact of the May 16, 2024 merger with Lakeland Bancorp, Inc. (“Lakeland”), which added $10.91 billion to total assets, $7.91 billion to loans, and $8.62 billion to deposits, net of purchase accounting adjustments. The merger with Lakeland significantly impacted provisions for credit losses in the trailing quarter due to the initial CECL provisions recorded on acquired loans. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included other transaction costs related to the merger with Lakeland, totaling $15.6 million and $36.7 million, respectively, compared with transaction costs totaling $2.3 million and $5.3 million for the respective 2023 periods. Additionally, the Company realized a $2.8 million loss related to the sale of subordinated debt issued by Lakeland from the Provident investment portfolio, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\nAnthony J. Labozzetta, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, “We achieved solid performance this quarter, and we are optimistic that our results will continue to improve as we further realize the synergies of the merger. Provident generated strong earnings and core metrics, aided by robust performance in our fee-based businesses. We continue to expand our operations prudently and believe we are well-positioned for even greater success as market conditions improve.”\n\nRegarding the Company's merger with Lakeland, Mr. Labozzetta added, “We are proud to announce that, with the conversion of our core system in early September, our merger is complete and we are a unified organization. Our cultures are combining well and we are already experiencing the benefits of cost savings and enhanced revenue opportunities. We are grateful to the many team members whose hard work allowed for a smooth conversion and the retention of almost all legacy Lakeland customers.”\n\n**Performance Highlights for the****Third Quarter****of****2024**\n\n  * Net interest income increased $42.2 million to $183.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $141.5 million for the trailing quarter primarily due to the full quarter impact of net assets acquired from Lakeland, including the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments and four basis points of core margin expansion. \n  * The net interest margin increased ten basis points to 3.31% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, from 3.21% for the trailing quarter. The weighted average yield on interest-earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 17 basis points to 5.84%, compared to the trailing quarter, while the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased ten basis points to 3.19%, compared to the trailing quarter. The increases in the yields and costs on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities were primarily due to a full quarter of accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to the Lakeland merger, which contributed approximately 53 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter.\n  * Non-interest income increased $4.6 million to $26.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from $22.3 million for the trailing quarter, while non-interest expense increased $20.6 million to $136.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $115.4 million for the trailing quarter. The increases in both non-interest income and non-interest expense were reflective of a full quarter of combined operations with Lakeland.\n  * Wealth management and insurance agency income increased 9.0% and 12.6%, respectively, versus the same period in 2023. The increase in wealth management income was primarily due to an increase in the average market value of assets under management during the period, while the increase in insurance agency income was largely due to an increase in business activity.\n  * Adjusting for transaction costs related to the merger with Lakeland, net of tax, the Company's annualized adjusted returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity(1) were 0.95%, 8.62% and 14.53% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.06%, 0.53% and 2.01% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. A reconciliation between GAAP and the above non-GAAP ratios are shown on page 13 of the earnings release.\n  * The Company's annualized adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity(2) were 1.48%, 13.48% and 19.77% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.47%, 13.26% and 19.21% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. A reconciliation between GAAP and the above non-GAAP ratios are shown on page 14 of the earnings release.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, the Company's loan pipeline, consisting of work-in-process and loans approved pending closing, totaled $1.98 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.18%, compared to $1.67 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.53%, as of June 30, 2024.\n  * The Company recorded a $9.6 million provision for credit losses on loans for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a $66.1 million provision for the trailing quarter. The provision for credit losses on loans in the quarter was primarily attributable to specific reserves required on individually analyzed loans, combined with some economic forecast deterioration. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans increased to 1.02% as of September 30, 2024, from 1.00% as of June 30, 2024.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, CRE loans related to office properties totaled $921.1 million, compared to $953.5 million as of June 30, 2024. CRE loans secured by office properties constitutes only 4.9% of total loans and have an average loan size of $1.9 million, with just seven relationships greater than $10.0 million. There were four loans totaling $9.2 million on non-accrual as of September 30, 2024, however we do not expect to incur losses on any of these loans.\n  * As of September 30, 2024, multi-family CRE loans secured by New York City properties totaled $226.6 million, compared to $227.7 million as of June 30, 2024. This portfolio constitutes only 1.2% of total loans and has an average loan size of $2.6 million. Loans that are collateralized by rent stabilized apartments comprise less than 0.80% of the total loan portfolio and are all performing.\n  * Non-performing loans to total loans as of September 30, 2024 increased to 0.47%, compared to 0.36% as of June 30, 2024, while non-performing assets to total assets as of September 30, 2024 increased to 0.41%, compared to 0.33% as of June 30, 2024. The increase in non-performing loans, compared to the prior quarter was primarily attributable to one commercial real estate credit secured by an industrial property which has a loan-to-value ratio of approximately 39%. We anticipate a near-term resolution of this credit with no expected loss. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs totaled $6.8 million, or an annualized 14 basis points of average loans. Of this total, $6.4 million was attributable to one previously identified commercial relationship that had a $4.4 million specific reserve as of June 30, 2024. This credit is expected to be fully resolved in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n\n\n**Declaration of Quarterly Dividend**\n\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per common share payable on November 29, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 15, 2024.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\n**_Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024_**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $46.4 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $11.5 million, or $0.11 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to the Lakeland merger contributed 53 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter. The current net interest margin reflects a full quarter of the acquisition of Lakeland’s interest-bearing assets and liabilities, the prior quarter sale of $554.2 million of securities acquired from Lakeland and the repayment of overnight borrowings as well as the prior quarter issuance of subordinated debt.\n\nThe weighted average yield on interest-earning assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 increased 17 basis points to 5.84%, compared to the trailing quarter.

All yields and costs reflect a full quarter of combined operations with Lakeland.\n\n**_Provision for Credit Losses on Loans_**\n\nFor the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $9.6 million provision for credit losses on loans, compared with a provision for credit losses on loans of $66.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The provision for credit losses on loans in the quarter was primarily attributable to specific reserves required on individually analyzed loans, combined with some economic forecast deterioration, while the provision for credit losses on loans in the prior quarter was primarily attributable to an initial CECL provision for credit losses of $60.1 million, recorded as part of the Lakeland merger in accordance with GAAP requirements for accounting for business combinations.

Net gain on securities transactions increased $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to a $2.8 million loss realized on the sale from the Provident investment portfolio of subordinated debt issued by Lakeland in the prior quarter. Fee income increased $1.1 million to $9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to increases in deposit and debit card related fee income. The increases in fee income are primarily attributable to the addition of the Lakeland customer base. BOLI income increased $1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, primarily due to an increase in benefit claims recognized. Partially offsetting these increases in non-interest income, insurance agency income decreased $857,000 to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, due to a seasonal decrease in business activity in the current quarter, while wealth management income decreased $149,000 to $7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, mainly due to a seasonal decrease in tax preparation fees, partially offset by an increase in the average market value of assets under management during the period.\n\nNon-interest expense totaled $136.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $20.6 million, compared to $115.4 million for the trailing quarter. Compensation and benefits expense increased $8.6 million to $63.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $54.9 million for the trailing quarter.

Additionally, FDIC insurance increased $1.1 million to $4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulting from the impact of the Lakeland merger. Partially offsetting these increases, merger-related expenses decreased $3.3 million to $15.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter.\n\nThe Company’s annualized adjusted non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets(5) declined to 1.98% for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.02% for the trailing quarter.

The increase in tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the trailing quarter was largely due to an increase in taxable income in the current quarter as a result of the Lakeland merger and a $5.3 million tax benefit realized in the trailing quarter related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets to reflect the imposition by the State of New Jersey of a 2.5% Corporate Transit Fee, effective January 1, 2024. \n\n**_Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023_**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported net income of $46.4 million, or $0.36 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $28.5 million, or $0.38 per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to the Lakeland merger contributed 53 basis points to the net interest margin in the current quarter.

The efficiency ratio (adjusted non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income)(6) was 57.20% for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 54.81% for the same respective period in 2023.\n\n**_Income Tax Expense_**\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's income tax expense was $18.9 million with an effective tax rate of 28.9%, compared with an income tax expense of $8.8 million with an effective tax rate of 23.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period last year was largely due to an increase in taxable income in the quarter, as a result of the Lakeland merger and the imposition by the State of New Jersey of a 2.5% Corporate Transit Fee in the prior quarter.\n\n**_Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023_**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net income totaled $67.0 million, or $0.65 per basic and diluted share, compared to net income of $101.1 million, or $1.35 per basic and diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Company’s earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were impacted by an initial CECL provision for credit losses on loans and commitments to extend credit of $60.1 million recorded as part of the Lakeland merger in accordance with GAAP requirements for accounting for business combinations. Transaction costs related to our merger with Lakeland totaled $36.7 million and $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additionally, the Company realized a $2.8 million loss related to the sale from the Provident investment portfolio of subordinated debt issued by Lakeland, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**_Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin_**\n\nNet interest income increased $115.2 million to $418.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from $303.7 million for same period in 2023. Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was favorably impacted by the net assets acquired from Lakeland, combined with the favorable repricing of adjustable rate loans, higher market rates on new loan originations and the originations of higher-yielding loans, partially offset by the unfavorable repricing of both deposits and borrowings.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net interest margin decreased one basis point to 3.18%, compared to 3.19% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The weighted average yield on interest earning assets increased 85 basis points to 5.61% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 99 basis points to 3.06% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.07% for the same period last year. The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 102 basis points to 2.84% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.82% for the same period last year. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $514.3 million to $2.90 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with $2.38 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of total deposits, including non-interest-bearing deposits, was 2.27% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.40% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The average cost of borrowings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.73%, compared to 3.29% for the same period last year.\n\n**_Provision for Credit Losses on Loans_**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $75.9 million provision for credit losses on loans, compared with a provision for credit losses on loans of $27.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increased provision for credit losses on loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to an initial CECL provision for credit losses on loans of $60.1 million recorded as part of the Lakeland merger in accordance with GAAP requirements for accounting for business combinations, partially offset by an improved economic forecast for the current nine-month period within our CECL model, compared to the same period last year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net charge-offs totaled $9.1 million or an annualized eight basis points of average loans.\n\n**_Non-Interest Income and Expense_**\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2024, non-interest income totaled $69.9 million, an increase of $9.1 million compared to the same period in 2023. Fee income increased $6.1 million to $24.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in deposit fee income, debit and credit card related fee income and loan related fee income resulting from the Lakeland merger. BOLI income increased $4.6 million to $9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in benefit claims recognized, combined with an increase in income related to the addition of Lakeland's BOLI, while wealth management income increased $2.1 million to $22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to an increase in the average market value of assets under management during the period. Additionally, insurance agency income increased $1.7 million to $12.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $11.2 million for the same period in 2023, largely due to increases in contingent commissions, retention revenue and new business activity. Partially offsetting these increases in non-interest income, net gains on securities transactions decreased $3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to a $2.8 million loss related to the sale from the Provident investment portfolio of subordinated debt issued by Lakeland. Other income decreased $2.4 million to $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.7 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to a $2.0 million gain from the sale of a foreclosed commercial property recorded in the prior year, combined with a decrease in gains on sales of SBA loans.\n\nNon-interest expense totaled $323.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of $123.7 million, compared to $199.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Compensation and benefits expense increased $48.7 million to $158.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $109.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to the addition of Lakeland. Merger-related expenses increased $31.3 million to $36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Amortization of intangibles increased $17.2 million to $19.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, largely due to core deposit intangible amortization related to Lakeland. Data processing expense increased $9.2 million to $25.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to additional software and hardware expenses needed for the addition of Lakeland, while net occupancy expense increased $8.0 million to $32.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in depreciation and maintenance expense related to the addition of Lakeland. Other operating expenses increased $5.6 million to $37.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to $31.8 million for the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in professional service expenses, while FDIC insurance increased $3.9 million to $9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the addition of Lakeland.\n\n**_Income Tax Expense_** For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's income tax expense was $19.9 million with an effective tax rate of 22.9%, compared with $34.9 million with an effective tax rate of 25.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same period last year was largely due to a $5.8 million tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets to reflect the imposition by the State of New Jersey of a 2.5% Corporate Transit Fee, effective January 1, 2024, combined with a decrease in taxable income as a result of the initial CECL provision for credit losses on loans of $60.1 million recorded in accordance with GAAP requirements for accounting for business combinations and additional expenses from the Lakeland merger.\n\n**_Asset Quality_**\n\nThe Company’s total non-performing loans as of September 30, 2024 were $89.9 million, or 0.47% of total loans, compared to $67.9 million, or 0.36% of total loans as of June 30, 2024 and $49.6 million, or 0.46% of total loans as of December 31, 2023. The $22.1 million increase in non-performing loans as of September 30, 2024, compared to the trailing quarter, consisted of a $10.4 million increase in non-performing commercial mortgage loans, an $8.9 million increase in non-performing commercial loans, a $1.5 million increase in non-performing construction loans, a $764,000 increase in non-performing residential mortgage loans, a $302,000 increase in non-performing multi-family loans and a $289,000 increase in non-performing consumer loans.

The allowance for credit losses increased $84.0 million to $191.2 million as of September 30, 2024, from $107.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due to a $75.9 million provision for credit losses, which included an initial CECL provision of $60.1 million on loans acquired from Lakeland, and a $17.2 million allowance recorded through goodwill related to Purchased Credit Deteriorated loans acquired from Lakeland, partially offset by net charge-offs of $9.1 million.\n\nThe following table sets forth accruing past due loans and non-accrual loans on the dates indicated, as well as delinquency statistics and certain asset quality ratios.\n\n**September 30, 2024**| **June 30, 2024**| **December 31, 2023**  \n---|---|---  \n**Number****of****Loans**| **Principal****Balance****of Loans**| **Number****of****Loans**| **Principal****Balance****of Loans**| **Number****of****Loans**| **Principal****Balance****of Loans**  \n**(Dollars in thousands)**  \n**Accruing past due loans:**  \n30 to 59 days past due:  \nCommercial mortgage loans| 2| $| 430| 3| $| 1,707| 1| $| 825  \nMulti-family mortgage loans| —| —| —| —| 1| 3,815  \nConstruction loans| —| —| —| —| —| —  \nResidential mortgage loans| 23| 5,020| 9| 1,714| 13| 3,429  \nTotal mortgage loans| 25| 5,450| 12| 3,421| 15| 8,069  \nCommercial loans| 14| 1,952| 20| 3,444| 6| 998  \nConsumer loans| 53| 4,073| 38| 2,891| 31| 875  \nTotal 30 to 59 days past due| 92| $| 11,475| 70| $| 9,756| 52| $| 9,942  \n60 to 89 days past due:  \nCommercial mortgage loans| 1| $| 641| 3| $| 1,231| —| $| —  \nMulti-family mortgage loans| —| —| —| —| 1| 1,635  \nConstruction loans| —| —| —| —| —| —  \nResidential mortgage loans| 11| 1,991| 10| 2,193| 8| 1,208  \nTotal mortgage loans| 12| 2,632| 13| 3,424| 9| 2,843  \nCommercial loans| 9| 1,240| 6| 1,146| 3| 198  \nConsumer loans| 10| 606| 9| 648| 5| 275  \nTotal 60 to 89 days past due| 31| 4,478| 28| 5,218| 17| 3,316  \nTotal accruing past due loans| 123| $| 15,953| 98| $| 14,974| 69| $| 13,258  \n**Non-accrual:**  \nCommercial mortgage loans| 17| $| 13,969| 10| $| 3,588| 7| $| 5,151  \nMulti-family mortgage loans| 6| 7,578| 5| 7,276| 1| 744  \nConstruction loans| 2| 13,151| 1| 11,698| 1| 771  \nResidential mortgage loans| 24| 5,211| 20| 4,447| 7| 853  \nTotal mortgage loans| 49| 39,909| 36| 27,009| 16| 7,519  \nCommercial loans| 69| 48,592| 58| 39,715| 26| 41,487  \nConsumer loans| 32| 1,433| 24| 1,144| 10| 633  \nTotal non-accrual loans| 150| $| 89,934| 118| $| 67,868| 52| $| 49,639  \nNon-performing loans to total loans| 0.47| %| 0.36| %| 0.46| %  \nAllowance for loan losses to total non-performing loans| 217.09| %| 277.50| %| 215.96| %  \nAllowance for loan losses to total loans| 1.02| %| 1.00| %| 0.99| %  \n  \nAs of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held foreclosed assets of $9.8 million and $11.7 million, respectively.

Provident Bank’s First-Time Home Buyer Survey Reveals That While Homeownership Continues to Be Challenging, Many Americans Are Finding Their Home in Less Than a Year\n\nCompany Release - 10/15/2024 8:00 AM ET\n\nDownload the PDF version PDF Format (opens in new window)\n\nISELIN, N.J., Oct. 15, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- [**Provident Bank,**](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=wvdM0Y2i96V_XungZ1rDeuTb7Pg-xfRqgpLKRjXJLeGgFIlJX_Y5uRNd7nxBqME92z_SVCe2iywswhzvXuyeacM0Wo1QL9RgqXZa3E_jPCfJbwnvMOD5pc4L8FUSpUr893DgBVKOPno8wkkO-Ql9QtjLM4g0IMyy5pCU4XThFMXyAi-yIfvY8whrBYL0R4w53axBYRAGf48QOCMdr6Q--TWX-jBEZeDpXeT2WCrVyYD4zaJvF_3MkMEU-u3K53F-ZW-J6S8j-kkQB0GYqcpXyCVP893o8Vg8IizYkxKWN67_QWq-877km9sAKd6eda6ne2Zbz5mqQMY4rb_kS-OjFmAkBQgniuMoJB4tqlYnnlA=) a leading New Jersey-based financial institution, has released the results of its First-Time Home Buyer Survey, taking stock of the generational differences in how Americans are navigating a complicated housing market. This year’s survey revealed that, not surprisingly, searching for a first home is extremely challenging. The top two factors impacting budgets are high mortgage rates and the lack of homes within an original budget. However, across generations, Americans appear to be buying their first home after only looking less than a year, signaling growing optimism in the market.\n\n**Potential homeowners are prolonging the buying process and waiting to make a final purchase:**\n\nSearching for a new home is challenging for first-time home buyers across generations. There are frequent bidding wars, which can lead to many making sacrifices for their dream home.\n\n  * Over 40% of Gen Xers have been involved in a significant number (5+) of bidding wars during the home-buying process. Comparatively, only 30% of Millennial respondents have had the same experience.\n  * Over 50% of Gen X respondents have had to significantly adjust their search criteria to stay within budget. Nearly 50% of both Millennials and Gen X respondents noted that they’ve settled for an older home that needs renovations to complete the buying process, compared to only 39% of Gen Z respondents.\n\n\n\n**Amidst all of these challenges, Americans still look toward traditional financial avenues to complete the home-buying process:**\n\nOverall, potential homeowners are still looking to traditional financial institutions to help them through the home-buying process. However, there are clear differences between how generations think about their financing options and the experts available to them.\n\n  * Over half of respondents noted that their savings account is their main source of capital for their down payment. The second highest source of capital stems from access to first-time home buyer program grant(s).\n  * 15% of Gen X respondents will look to a fintech company for financing for buying a first home compared to only 6% of Gen Z respondents. Nearly 56% of Gen X respondents will be speaking to a traditional bank as a source for the financing process in buying their first home.\n  * Just under 50% of all Millennial respondents noted they would look to a traditional bank for financing to buy their first home.\n\n\n\n“The findings from this year’s survey support what we’ve been hearing directly from customers - in order to navigate a highly competitive home buying market, understanding all of the financing resources and capital requirements at your disposal is the key to success,” said Margaret Volk, Senior Vice President, and Director of Mortgage and Consumer Lending, at Provident Bank. “Especially as we enter a new phase of the mortgage rate cycle, we believe it is our responsibility to ensure our customers are equipped with the resources and information needed to navigate the financing process to achieve such an important life goal like buying a home.”\n\nThe survey was conducted by Survey Monkey, a market research provider, on behalf of Provident Bank. The findings are based on 1,000 responses.\n\n**About Provident Bank**\n\nFounded in Jersey City in 1839, Provident Bank is the oldest community-focused financial institution based in New Jersey and is the wholly owned subsidiary of Provident Financial Services, Inc.
