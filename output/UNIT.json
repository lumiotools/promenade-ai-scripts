(“Uniti” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: UNIT) today announced its results for the third quarter 2024.\n\n“We continue to see solid demand for our mission critical fiber infrastructure at Uniti with consolidated bookings of nearly $1 million in monthly recurring revenue during the quarter. Demand from our Hyperscaler customers also remains strong as we recently announced a long-term award in Montgomery, AL that will add fiber in a strategic market for Uniti that will be available for lease-up,” commented President and Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Gunderman.\n\nMr. Gunderman continued, “Turning to our transformational merger with Windstream that we announced earlier this year, we continue to make significant progress and remain on track to close the merger by the second half of 2025. Through the recent credit agreement amendments and successful refinancing activity at Windstream, we now have a clear path to collapsing the dual debt silos of Uniti and Windstream upon closing of the merger, thus greatly simplifying the capital structure of the combined company. Finally, Windstream now has the capital on-hand to accelerate Kinetic’s fiber-to-the-home buildout, further strengthening its position within the residential fiber market.”\n\n**QUARTERLY RESULTS**\n\nConsolidated revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $292.2 million. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were $12.2 million and $235.3 million, respectively, for the same period, achieving Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 81%. Net income attributable to common shares was $11.9 million for the period. AFFO attributable to common shareholders was $87.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share.\n\nUniti Fiber contributed $69.3 million of revenues and $25.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024. Uniti Fiber’s net success-based capital expenditures during the quarter were $26.2 million.\n\nUniti Leasing contributed revenues of $222.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $215.2 million for the third quarter. During the quarter, Uniti Leasing deployed capital expenditures of $35.5 million, including $34.2 million of GCI capex.\n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\nAt quarter-end, the Company had approximately $529.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and undrawn borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement. The Company’s leverage ratio at quarter-end was 6.05x based on net debt to third quarter 2024 annualized Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the debt and the net contributions from the ABS loan facility.\n\n**UPDATED FULL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK**\n\nThe Company is updating its 2024 outlook primarily for business unit level revisions, and transaction related and other costs incurred to date. Our outlook excludes any impact from the expected merger with Windstream, future acquisitions, capital market transactions, and future transaction-related and other costs not mentioned herein.\n\nThe Company’s consolidated outlook for 2024 is as follows (in millions):\n\n**Full Year 2024**  \n---  \nRevenue | $ | 1,157 | to | $ | 1,177  \nNet income attributable to common shareholders | 88 | to | 108  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) | 930 | to | 950  \nInterest expense, net (2) | 514 | to | 514  \nAttributable to common shareholders:  \nFFO (1) | 290 | to | 310  \nAFFO (1) | 351 | to | 371  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted | 285 | to | 285  \n________________________  \n(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.(2) See “Components of Interest Expense” below.  \n  \n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nUniti will hold a conference call today to discuss this earnings release at 8:30 AM Eastern Time (7:30 AM Central Time). The conference call will be webcast live on Uniti’s Investor Relations website at [investor.uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Vdzg8YIM29EP0uenaOdvz9mCeL55hUvVdojDU8j9LYbGku--Sgu4n5QNezrLEO7QQuNTKs-00aCpybaEhGyrm8fkzQ1RAiDnvFiy-koQ0zo=).

Those forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical statements of fact, including, without limitation, our 2024 financial outlook, expectations regarding lease-up of our network, strong demand trends, business strategies, growth prospects, and statements regarding our merger with Windstream and potential synergies, cost savings and the future performance of New Uniti (together with Windstream and Uniti, the “Merged Group”). In addition, this communication contains statements concerning the intentions, beliefs and expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of the directors and management of Uniti and Windstream for Uniti and Windstream, respectively, and the Merged Group, the anticipated timing for and outcome and effects of the Merger (including expected benefits to shareholders of Uniti), expectations for the final capital structure, ongoing development and growth potential of the Merged Group and the future operation of Uniti, Windstream and the Merged Group._\n\n_Words such as \"anticipate(s),\" \"expect(s),\" \"intend(s),\" “estimate(s),” “foresee(s),” \"plan(s),\" \"believe(s),\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"seek(s),\" “appear(s),” “target(s),” “project(s),” “contemplate(s),” “predict(s),” “potential,” “continue(s)” and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could lead to actual results differing materially from those projected, forecasted or expected. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained. Factors which could materially alter our expectations include, but are not limited to, the future prospects of Windstream, our largest customer; the ability and willingness of our customers to renew their leases with us upon their expiration, and the ability to reposition our properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or in the event we replace an existing tenant; the availability of and our ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to acquire and lease the respective properties on favorable terms; the risk that we fail to fully realize the potential benefits of acquisitions or have difficulty integrating acquired companies; our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness and fund our capital funding commitments; our ability to access debt and equity capital markets; the impact on our business or the business of our customers as a result of credit rating downgrades and fluctuating interest rates; our ability to retain our key management personnel; changes in the U.S. tax law and other state, federal or local laws, whether or not specific to real estate investment trusts; covenants in our debt agreements that may limit our operational flexibility; the possibility that we may experience equipment failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or terrorist attacks for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; other risks inherent in the communications industry and in the ownership of communications distribution systems, including potential liability relating to environmental matters and illiquidity of real estate investments; the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals on the terms desired or anticipated; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Merger, including, without limitation, difficulties that result in the failure to realize expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings from the Merger within the expected time period (if at all); potential difficulties in Uniti’s and Windstream’s ability to retain employees as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Merger; risks relating to the value of New Uniti’s securities to be issued in connection with the Merger; disruptions of Uniti’s and Windstream’s current plans, operations and relationships with customers caused by the announcement and pendency of the Merger; legal proceedings that may be instituted against Uniti or Windstream following announcement of the Merger; funding requirements; regulatory restrictions (including changes in regulatory restrictions or regulatory policy); and additional factors described in our reports filed with the SEC._\n\n_There can be no assurance that the Merger will be implemented or that plans of the respective directors and management of Uniti and Windstream for the Merged Group will proceed as currently expected or will ultimately be successful. Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, including in respect of the financial or operating outlook for Uniti, Windstream or the Merged Group (including the realization of any cost savings or expected synergies). See also “Additional Information and Where to Find it.”_\n\n_All forward-looking statements are based on information and estimates available at the time of this communication and are not guarantees of future performance._\n\n_Except as required by applicable law, Uniti does not assume any obligation to, and expressly disclaims any duty to, provide any additional or updated information or to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results, or otherwise. Nothing in this communication will, under any circumstances (including by reason of this communication remaining available and not being superseded or replaced by any other presentation or publication with respect to Uniti, Windstream or the Merged Group, or the subject matter of this communication), create an implication that there has been no change in the affairs of Uniti or Windstream since the date of this communication._\n\n**NON-GAAP PRESENTATION**\n\n_This release and today’s conference call contain certain supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Such measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP.

While we believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\n\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction and integration related costs, costs associated with Windstream’s bankruptcy, costs associated with litigation claims made against us, and costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, (collectively, “Transaction Related and Other Costs”), costs related to the settlement with Windstream, goodwill impairment charges, severance costs, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBecause the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires the recognition of depreciation expense except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of FFO from unconsolidated entities. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition.\n\nThe Company defines AFFO, as FFO excluding (i) Transaction Related and Other Costs; (ii) costs related to the litigation settlement with Windstream, accretion on our settlement obligation, and gains on the prepayment of our settlement obligation as these items are not reflective of ongoing operating performance; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt and equity discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, straight line revenues, non-cash income taxes, and the amortization of other non-cash revenues to the extent that cash has not been received, such as revenue associated with the amortization of tenant capital improvements; and (v) the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, additional costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, severance costs, taxes associated with tax basis cancellation of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments and similar or infrequent items less maintenance capital expenditures. AFFO includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of AFFO from unconsolidated entities. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and analysts, and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating performance. In particular, we believe AFFO, by excluding certain revenue and expense items, can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and events, such as transaction and integration related costs. The Company uses FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, only as performance measures, and FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.\n\nFurther, our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to that reported by other REITs or companies that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO differently than we do.\n\nINVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nPaul Bullington, 251-662-1512Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer[paul.bullington@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a9rTAn9ZNHnnI9IUJS7-6NAf_MGRPxQcVwVGwkODvCHL2622YSTZzJt92o8Z5xwUUwMeiOGiPjiIi6Q6ywBBU8BBhIUx9esj6gUp1fP1nVhxhAjpRBaWudrdwAiB1qiU)\n\nBill DiTullio, 501-850-0872Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasury[bill.ditullio@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=25asv9fO2lPyzq-SbzXUyj5J_SC1mX-nqXtaPxqb3rMdptfLqR6EeNifWNLbx8ZZMkCIzR_JEJjJVaF8C8orYryLlwPvFo7AjkCjoLJt31k=)\n\nThis press release was published by a CLEAR® Verified individual.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NTAyOCM2NTU3Njc3IzIwMTczNzg=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MGQ0Nzc1Y2QtMjMyNi00OTQ5LWIxMjYtYjk2ZTNkOWUyYTRlLTEwMjg5NTE=/tiny/Uniti-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158/small/uniti-50632-uniti-parent-logo-rgb-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158)\n\nSource: Uniti Group Inc.\n"

Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results\n\nOctober 31, 2024\n\n[PDF Version](/node/13701/pdf)\n\n**_Third Quarter Consolidated Bookings Monthly Recurring Revenue of $0.9 Million Increased Over 20% From Prior Year_**\n\n**_Updates 2024 Outlook_**\n\n  * **Net Income of $12.2 Million for the Third Quarter**\n  * **Net Income of $0.05 Per Diluted Common Share for the Third Quarter**\n  * **AFFO of $0.33 Per Diluted Common Share for the Third Quarter**\n\n\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark., Oct. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uniti Group Inc. (“Uniti” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: UNIT) today announced its results for the third quarter 2024.\n\n“We continue to see solid demand for our mission critical fiber infrastructure at Uniti with consolidated bookings of nearly $1 million in monthly recurring revenue during the quarter. Demand from our Hyperscaler customers also remains strong as we recently announced a long-term award in Montgomery, AL that will add fiber in a strategic market for Uniti that will be available for lease-up,” commented President and Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Gunderman.\n\nMr. Gunderman continued, “Turning to our transformational merger with Windstream that we announced earlier this year, we continue to make significant progress and remain on track to close the merger by the second half of 2025. Through the recent credit agreement amendments and successful refinancing activity at Windstream, we now have a clear path to collapsing the dual debt silos of Uniti and Windstream upon closing of the merger, thus greatly simplifying the capital structure of the combined company. Finally, Windstream now has the capital on-hand to accelerate Kinetic’s fiber-to-the-home buildout, further strengthening its position within the residential fiber market.”\n\n**QUARTERLY RESULTS**\n\nConsolidated revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were $292.2 million. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were $12.2 million and $235.3 million, respectively, for the same period, achieving Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 81%. Net income attributable to common shares was $11.9 million for the period. AFFO attributable to common shareholders was $87.1 million, or $0.33 per diluted common share.\n\nUniti Fiber contributed $69.3 million of revenues and $25.6 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2024. Uniti Fiber’s net success-based capital expenditures during the quarter were $26.2 million.\n\nUniti Leasing contributed revenues of $222.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $215.2 million for the third quarter. During the quarter, Uniti Leasing deployed capital expenditures of $35.5 million, including $34.2 million of GCI capex.\n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\nAt quarter-end, the Company had approximately $529.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and undrawn borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement. The Company’s leverage ratio at quarter-end was 6.05x based on net debt to third quarter 2024 annualized Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the debt and the net contributions from the ABS loan facility.\n\n**UPDATED FULL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK**\n\nThe Company is updating its 2024 outlook primarily for business unit level revisions, and transaction related and other costs incurred to date. Our outlook excludes any impact from the expected merger with Windstream, future acquisitions, capital market transactions, and future transaction-related and other costs not mentioned herein.\n\nThe Company’s consolidated outlook for 2024 is as follows (in millions):\n\n**Full Year 2024**  \n---  \nRevenue | $ | 1,157 | to | $ | 1,177  \nNet income attributable to common shareholders | 88 | to | 108  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) | 930 | to | 950  \nInterest expense, net (2) | 514 | to | 514  \nAttributable to common shareholders:  \nFFO (1) | 290 | to | 310  \nAFFO (1) | 351 | to | 371  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted | 285 | to | 285  \n________________________  \n(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.(2) See “Components of Interest Expense” below.  \n  \n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nUniti will hold a conference call today to discuss this earnings release at 8:30 AM Eastern Time (7:30 AM Central Time).

Those forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical statements of fact, including, without limitation, our 2024 financial outlook, expectations regarding lease-up of our network, strong demand trends, business strategies, growth prospects, and statements regarding our merger with Windstream and potential synergies, cost savings and the future performance of New Uniti (together with Windstream and Uniti, the “Merged Group”). In addition, this communication contains statements concerning the intentions, beliefs and expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of the directors and management of Uniti and Windstream for Uniti and Windstream, respectively, and the Merged Group, the anticipated timing for and outcome and effects of the Merger (including expected benefits to shareholders of Uniti), expectations for the final capital structure, ongoing development and growth potential of the Merged Group and the future operation of Uniti, Windstream and the Merged Group._\n\n_Words such as \"anticipate(s),\" \"expect(s),\" \"intend(s),\" “estimate(s),” “foresee(s),” \"plan(s),\" \"believe(s),\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"seek(s),\" “appear(s),” “target(s),” “project(s),” “contemplate(s),” “predict(s),” “potential,” “continue(s)” and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could lead to actual results differing materially from those projected, forecasted or expected. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained. Factors which could materially alter our expectations include, but are not limited to, the future prospects of Windstream, our largest customer; the ability and willingness of our customers to renew their leases with us upon their expiration, and the ability to reposition our properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or in the event we replace an existing tenant; the availability of and our ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to acquire and lease the respective properties on favorable terms; the risk that we fail to fully realize the potential benefits of acquisitions or have difficulty integrating acquired companies; our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness and fund our capital funding commitments; our ability to access debt and equity capital markets; the impact on our business or the business of our customers as a result of credit rating downgrades and fluctuating interest rates; our ability to retain our key management personnel; changes in the U.S. tax law and other state, federal or local laws, whether or not specific to real estate investment trusts; covenants in our debt agreements that may limit our operational flexibility; the possibility that we may experience equipment failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or terrorist attacks for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; other risks inherent in the communications industry and in the ownership of communications distribution systems, including potential liability relating to environmental matters and illiquidity of real estate investments; the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals on the terms desired or anticipated; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Merger, including, without limitation, difficulties that result in the failure to realize expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings from the Merger within the expected time period (if at all); potential difficulties in Uniti’s and Windstream’s ability to retain employees as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Merger; risks relating to the value of New Uniti’s securities to be issued in connection with the Merger; disruptions of Uniti’s and Windstream’s current plans, operations and relationships with customers caused by the announcement and pendency of the Merger; legal proceedings that may be instituted against Uniti or Windstream following announcement of the Merger; funding requirements; regulatory restrictions (including changes in regulatory restrictions or regulatory policy); and additional factors described in our reports filed with the SEC._\n\n_There can be no assurance that the Merger will be implemented or that plans of the respective directors and management of Uniti and Windstream for the Merged Group will proceed as currently expected or will ultimately be successful. Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, including in respect of the financial or operating outlook for Uniti, Windstream or the Merged Group (including the realization of any cost savings or expected synergies). See also “Additional Information and Where to Find it.”_\n\n_All forward-looking statements are based on information and estimates available at the time of this communication and are not guarantees of future performance._\n\n_Except as required by applicable law, Uniti does not assume any obligation to, and expressly disclaims any duty to, provide any additional or updated information or to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results, or otherwise. Nothing in this communication will, under any circumstances (including by reason of this communication remaining available and not being superseded or replaced by any other presentation or publication with respect to Uniti, Windstream or the Merged Group, or the subject matter of this communication), create an implication that there has been no change in the affairs of Uniti or Windstream since the date of this communication._\n\n**NON-GAAP PRESENTATION**\n\n_This release and today’s conference call contain certain supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Such measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP. Further information with respect to and reconciliations of such measures to the nearest GAAP measure can be found herein._\n\n**Uniti Group Inc.****Consolidated Balance Sheets****(In thousands, except

While we believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\n\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction and integration related costs, costs associated with Windstream’s bankruptcy, costs associated with litigation claims made against us, and costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, (collectively, “Transaction Related and Other Costs”), costs related to the settlement with Windstream, goodwill impairment charges, severance costs, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBecause the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires the recognition of depreciation expense except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of FFO from unconsolidated entities. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition.\n\nThe Company defines AFFO, as FFO excluding (i) Transaction Related and Other Costs; (ii) costs related to the litigation settlement with Windstream, accretion on our settlement obligation, and gains on the prepayment of our settlement obligation as these items are not reflective of ongoing operating performance; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt and equity discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, straight line revenues, non-cash income taxes, and the amortization of other non-cash revenues to the extent that cash has not been received, such as revenue associated with the amortization of tenant capital improvements; and (v) the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, additional costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, severance costs, taxes associated with tax basis cancellation of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments and similar or infrequent items less maintenance capital expenditures. AFFO includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of AFFO from unconsolidated entities. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and analysts, and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating performance. In particular, we believe AFFO, by excluding certain revenue and expense items, can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and events, such as transaction and integration related costs. The Company uses FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, only as performance measures, and FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.\n\nFurther, our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to that reported by other REITs or companies that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO differently than we do.\n\nINVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nPaul Bullington, 251-662-1512Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer[paul.bullington@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=a9rTAn9ZNHnnI9IUJS7-6NAf_MGRPxQcVwVGwkODvCHL2622YSTZzJt92o8Z5xwUUwMeiOGiPjiIi6Q6ywBBU8BBhIUx9esj6gUp1fP1nVhxhAjpRBaWudrdwAiB1qiU)\n\nBill DiTullio, 501-850-0872Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasury[bill.ditullio@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=25asv9fO2lPyzq-SbzXUyj5J_SC1mX-nqXtaPxqb3rMdptfLqR6EeNifWNLbx8ZZMkCIzR_JEJjJVaF8C8orYryLlwPvFo7AjkCjoLJt31k=)\n\nThis press release was published by a CLEAR® Verified individual.\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTI2NTAyOCM2NTU3Njc3IzIwMTczNzg=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/MGQ0Nzc1Y2QtMjMyNi00OTQ5LWIxMjYtYjk2ZTNkOWUyYTRlLTEwMjg5NTE=/tiny/Uniti-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158/small/uniti-50632-uniti-parent-logo-rgb-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158)\n\nSource: Uniti Group Inc.\n"

Approximately 40% of our consolidated bookings during the quarter, the highest level since 2022, was driven by Hyperscalers and Generative AI demand, and we expect that growth to continue. Our core recurring strategic fiber business grew 3% in the second quarter of 2024 when compared to the second quarter of 2023, while net success-based capital intensity at Uniti Fiber during the quarter declined to 27% from 44% in the second quarter of 2023,” commented President and Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Gunderman.\n\nMr. Gunderman continued, “We continue to make significant progress on our recently announced transformational merger with Windstream, and remain on track to close the transaction by the second half of 2025. As a combined company, we will continue our disciplined growth trajectory while expanding our fiber network into Tier II and III markets, and significantly improving our overall financial profile. The demand for both commercial and residential fiber has never been greater and Uniti is well positioned to capture this growth potential going forward.”\n\n**QUARTERLY RESULTS**\n\nConsolidated revenues for the second quarter of 2024 were $294.9 million. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were $18.3 million and $236.7 million, respectively, for the same period, achieving Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 80%. Net income attributable to common shares was $17.6 million for the period. AFFO attributable to common shareholders was $92.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted common share.\n\nUniti Fiber contributed $76.7 million of revenues and $31.1 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024, achieving Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 40%. Uniti Fiber’s net success-based capital expenditures during the quarter were $20.8 million.\n\nUniti Leasing contributed revenues of $218.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $210.9 million for the second quarter. During the quarter, Uniti Leasing deployed capital expenditures of $69.6 million, including $65.3 million of GCI capex.\n\n**FINANCING TRANSACTIONS**\n\nOn May 17, 2024, Uniti closed on the issuance of $300 million of additional senior secured notes due February 2028 (the “Additional 2028 Notes”). The Additional 2028 Notes bear interest of 10.50% and were issued at 103.00% of their principal amount. The proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the previously announced merger with Windstream.\n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\nAt quarter-end, the Company had approximately $618.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and undrawn borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement. The Company’s leverage ratio at quarter-end was 5.97x based on net debt to second quarter 2024 annualized Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the debt and Adjusted EBITDA impact from the ABS loan facility.\n\n**UPDATED FULL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK**\n\nThe Company is updating its 2024 outlook primarily for business unit level revisions, recent financing transactions, and transaction related and other costs incurred to date. Our outlook excludes any impact from the expected merger with Windstream, future acquisitions, capital market transactions, and future transaction-related and other costs not mentioned herein.\n\nThe Company’s consolidated outlook for 2024 is as follows (in millions):\n\n**Full Year 2024**  \n---  \nRevenue | $ | 1,154 | to | $ | 1,174  \nNet income attributable to common shareholders | 98 | to | 118  \nAdjusted EBITDA (1) | 930 | to | 950  \nInterest expense, net (2) | 514 | to | 514  \nAttributable to common shareholders:  \nFFO (1) | 301 | to | 321  \nAFFO (1) | 353 | to | 373  \nWeighted-average common shares outstanding – diluted | 285 | to | 285  \n________________________  \n(1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.(2) See “Components of Interest Expense” below.  \n  \n**CONFERENCE CALL**\n\nUniti will hold a conference call today to discuss the announced merger with Windstream and this earnings release at 8:30 AM Eastern Time (7:30 AM Central Time).

While we believe that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measure, we also believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance for a REIT.\n\nWe define “EBITDA” as net income, as defined by GAAP, before interest expense, provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction and integration related costs, costs associated with Windstream’s bankruptcy, costs associated with litigation claims made against us, and costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, (collectively, “Transaction Related and Other Costs”), costs related to the settlement with Windstream, goodwill impairment charges, severance costs, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBecause the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires the recognition of depreciation expense except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of FFO from unconsolidated entities. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition.\n\nThe Company defines AFFO, as FFO excluding (i) Transaction Related and Other Costs; (ii) costs related to the litigation settlement with Windstream, accretion on our settlement obligation, and gains on the prepayment of our settlement obligation as these items are not reflective of ongoing operating performance; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt and equity discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, straight line revenues, non-cash income taxes, and the amortization of other non-cash revenues to the extent that cash has not been received, such as revenue associated with the amortization of tenant capital improvements; and (v) the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, additional costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, severance costs, taxes associated with tax basis cancellation of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments and similar or infrequent items less maintenance capital expenditures. AFFO includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of AFFO from unconsolidated entities. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and analysts, and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating performance. In particular, we believe AFFO, by excluding certain revenue and expense items, can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and events, such as transaction and integration related costs. The Company uses FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, only as performance measures, and FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.\n\nFurther, our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to that reported by other REITs or companies that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO differently than we do.\n\nINVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nPaul Bullington, 251-662-1512Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer[paul.bullington@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=1Xt9lVrNMlF_AvoUdYhoOfYc6styMh_QaonOs192f_DeCsV_mvxf1Ljx51NjhyOBdPaefkIrp88uz2UFQURdeo2I-_7cD_bMxD63NDAOwerPfIy7SKXfgTjKo0HIwKA5)\n\nBill DiTullio, 501-850-0872Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasury[bill.ditullio@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=4XX9mNxob3iVICiHOg5Y6410In1Kyu7WoTZ-ed0oecHCsjRoTVU_e0o4i6yo03e1sEBKc0UpLaUknmSPIJQOpj9acNPavoy3WAbEoligOGI=)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTE5NzE0MyM2NDAyNDk4IzIwMTczNzg=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/M2IyZGFlZjgtNmFkYy00YzdiLWFmZDEtMWNlOTBiNjY4NTlmLTEwMjg5NTE=/tiny/Uniti-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158/small/uniti-50632-uniti-parent-logo-rgb-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158)\n\nSource: Uniti Group Inc.\n"

(“Uniti” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: UNIT) today announced its results for the first quarter 2024.\n\n“Uniti is off to a solid start in 2024. Our core recurring strategic fiber business grew 4% in the first quarter of 2024 when compared to the first quarter of 2023. Also, our net success-based capital intensity at Uniti Fiber during the quarter declined to 34% from 46% in the first quarter of 2023. These metrics further reiterate that our lease-up strategy continues to be successful. We also continue to see increasing demand from bandwidth intensive applications like Generative AI further reinforcing the mission critical nature of fiber,” commented President and Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Gunderman.\n\nMr. Gunderman continued, “Our transformational merger with Windstream that we announced earlier this morning will expand Uniti's network reach even further to 1.5 million homes passed with next-gen fiber. As a combined company, we will continue our disciplined growth trajectory while expanding fiber-to-the-home buildouts and significantly improving our overall financial profile. The demand for fiber broadband has never been greater and Uniti is well positioned for growth well into the future.”\n\n**QUARTERLY RESULTS**\n\nConsolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2024 were $286.4 million. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA were $41.3 million and $228.6 million, respectively, for the same period, achieving Adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 80%. Net income attributable to common shares was $40.9 million for the period. AFFO attributable to common shareholders was $87.6 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share.\n\nUniti Fiber contributed $68.8 million of revenues and $23.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024. Uniti Fiber’s net success-based capital expenditures during the quarter were $23.1 million.\n\nUniti Leasing contributed revenues of $217.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $210.7 million for the first quarter. During the quarter, Uniti Leasing deployed capital expenditures of $139.7 million, including $131.3 million of GCI capex.\n\n**LIQUIDITY**\n\nAt quarter-end, the Company had approximately $470.1 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and undrawn borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement. The Company’s leverage ratio at quarter-end was 6.07x based on net debt to first quarter 2024 annualized Adjusted EBITDA, excluding the debt and Adjusted EBITDA impact from the ABS loan facility.\n\nOn May 2, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per common share, payable on June 28, 2024, to stockholders of record on June 14, 2024.\n\n**UPDATED FULL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOK**\n\nThe Company is updating its 2024 outlook primarily for business unit level revisions and transaction related and other costs incurred to date.

In addition, this communication contains statements concerning the intentions, beliefs and expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of the directors and management of Uniti and Windstream for Uniti and Windstream, respectively, and the Merged Group, the anticipated timing for and outcome and effects of the Transaction (including expected benefits to shareholders of Uniti), expectations for the ongoing development and growth potential of the Merged Group and the future operation of Uniti, Windstream and the Merged Group. _\n\n_Words such as \"anticipate(s),\" \"expect(s),\" \"intend(s),\" “estimate(s),” “foresee(s),” \"plan(s),\" \"believe(s),\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"seek(s),\" “appear(s),” “target(s),” “project(s),” “contemplate(s),” “predict(s),” “potential,” “continue(s)” and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could lead to actual results differing materially from those projected, forecasted or expected. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that our expectations will be attained. Factors which could materially alter our expectations include, but are not limited to, the future prospects of Windstream, our largest customer; the ability and willingness of our customers to renew their leases with us upon their expiration, and the ability to reposition our properties on the same or better terms in the event of nonrenewal or in the event we replace an existing tenant; the availability of and our ability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities and our ability to acquire and lease the respective properties on favorable terms; the risk that we fail to fully realize the potential benefits of acquisitions or have difficulty integrating acquired companies; our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to service our outstanding indebtedness and fund our capital funding commitments; our ability to access debt and equity capital markets; the impact on our business or the business of our customers as a result of credit rating downgrades and fluctuating interest rates; our ability to retain our key management personnel; changes in the U.S. tax law and other state, federal or local laws, whether or not specific to real estate investment trusts; covenants in our debt agreements that may limit our operational flexibility; the possibility that we may experience equipment failures, natural disasters, cyber-attacks or terrorist attacks for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage; other risks inherent in the communications industry and in the ownership of communications distribution systems, including potential liability relating to environmental matters and illiquidity of real estate investments; the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the Transaction, including, without limitation, the receipt of shareholder and regulatory approvals on the terms desired or anticipated; unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Transaction, including, without limitation, difficulties that result in the failure to realize expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings from the Transaction within the expected time period (if at all); potential difficulties in Uniti’s and Windstream’s ability to retain employees as a result of the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; risks relating to the value of New Uniti’s securities to be issued in the Transaction; disruptions of Uniti’s and Windstream’s current plans, operations and relationships with customers caused by the announcement and pendency of the Transaction; legal proceedings that may be instituted against Uniti or Windstream following announcement of the Transaction; funding requirements; regulatory restrictions (including changes in regulatory restrictions or regulatory policy); and additional factors described in our reports filed with the SEC. _\n\n_There can be no assurance that the Transaction will be implemented or that plans of the respective directors and management of Uniti and Windstream for the Merged Group will proceed as currently expected or will ultimately be successful. Investors are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, including in respect of the financial or operating outlook for Uniti, Windstream or the Merged Group (including the realization of any expected synergies). _\n\n_All forward-looking statements are based on information and estimates available at the time of this communication and are not guarantees of future performance._\n\n_Except as required by applicable law, Uniti does not assume any obligation to, and expressly disclaims any duty to, provide any additional or updated information or to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results, or otherwise. Nothing in this communication will, under any circumstances (including by reason of this communication remaining available and not being superseded or replaced by any other presentation or publication with respect to Uniti, Windstream or the Merged Group, or the subject matter of this communication), create an implication that there has been no change in the affairs of Uniti or Windstream since the date of this communication._\n\n**NON-GAAP PRESENTATION**\n\n_This release and today’s conference call contain certain supplemental measures of performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Such measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP.

We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA before stock-based compensation expense and the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of transaction and integration related costs, costs associated with Windstream’s bankruptcy, costs associated with litigation claims made against us, and costs associated with the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system, (collectively, “Transaction Related and Other Costs”), costs related to the settlement with Windstream, goodwill impairment charges, severance costs, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs, costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments, and other similar or infrequent items (although we may not have had such charges in the periods presented). Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated entities. We believe EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are important supplemental measures to net income because they provide additional information to evaluate our operating performance on an unleveraged basis. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated similar to defined terms in our material debt agreements used to determine compliance with specific financial covenants. Since EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP.\n\nBecause the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires the recognition of depreciation expense except on land, such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that uses historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, NAREIT created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined by NAREIT as net income attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, and includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of FFO from unconsolidated entities. We compute FFO in accordance with NAREIT’s definition.\n\nThe Company defines AFFO, as FFO excluding (i) Transaction Related and Other Costs; (ii) costs related to the litigation settlement with Windstream, accretion on our settlement obligation, and gains on the prepayment of our settlement obligation as these items are not reflective of ongoing operating performance; (iii) goodwill impairment charges; (iv) certain non-cash revenues and expenses such as stock-based compensation expense, amortization of debt and equity discounts, amortization of deferred financing costs, depreciation and amortization of non-real estate assets, amortization of non-cash rights-of-use assets, straight line revenues, non-cash income taxes, and the amortization of other non-cash revenues to the extent that cash has not been received, such as revenue associated with the amortization of tenant capital improvements; and (v) the impact, which may be recurring in nature, of the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, additional costs incurred as a result of the early repayment of debt, including early tender and redemption premiums and costs associated with the termination of related hedging activities, severance costs, taxes associated with tax basis cancellation of debt, gains or losses on dispositions, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and financial instruments and similar or infrequent items less maintenance capital expenditures. AFFO includes adjustments to reflect the Company’s share of AFFO from unconsolidated entities. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among investors and analysts, and makes comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating performance. In particular, we believe AFFO, by excluding certain revenue and expense items, can help investors compare our operating performance between periods and to other REITs on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated items and events, such as transaction and integration related costs. The Company uses FFO and AFFO, and their respective per share amounts, only as performance measures, and FFO and AFFO do not purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance.\n\nFurther, our computations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to that reported by other REITs or companies that do not define FFO in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition or define EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO differently than we do.\n\nINVESTOR AND MEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nPaul Bullington, 251-662-1512Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer[paul.bullington@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=lOfjtMyKXrbCCYzFg18EJDnIj8hnS3Bn5Ass3ADQP64wesXwGNxsdsynX1MZyDxaufGTsR5UnTaEhqjrcJdaD84pYz8BFgTwi_5t1abJCU8Yg8I1BTJEGKEh9yMMMHJG)\n\nBill DiTullio, 501-850-0872Vice President, Investor Relations & Treasury[bill.ditullio@uniti.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=POsThfOtvUt4So_QxUNSZ_z6G3faGD2jnyibONJ249RVOSfbtYjIgagK_xkpSka_N9CxMq0B9s26TY8-eKT1OVVX8AEncCizplE0tVQNvtk=)\n\n![](https://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/ti?nf=OTExMDc2OCM2MjMyNzMzIzIwMTczNzg=)![](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/Nzc0ZTM0MGMtMDVjMi00MmQ0LTkyMjgtNDVlMGQ3MGRkZmE3LTEwMjg5NTE=/tiny/Uniti-Group-Inc-.png)\n\n[![Primary Logo](https://ml.globenewswire.com/media/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158/small/uniti-50632-uniti-parent-logo-rgb-png.png)](https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/b065ce09-4401-49b3-a72d-688f19428158)\n\nSource: Uniti Group Inc.\n"
