(NASDAQ:COCO) (“Vita Coco” or “the Company”), a leading high-growth platform of better-for-you beverage brands, today announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter and Year-To-Date 2024 Highlights Compared to Prior Year Period**\n\n  * Net sales declined 4% in the third quarter to $133 million resulting in year-to-date being flat at $389 million.\n  * _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water net sales growth of 8% in the third quarter and 5% year-to-date.\n  * Gross profit was $52 million in the third quarter, a decrease of $5 million and $157 million year-to-date, an increase of $17 million.\n  * Gross margin was 39% of net sales in the third quarter compared to 41% of net sales, and 41% of net sales year-to-date as compared to 36% of net sales.\n  * Net income was $19 million in the third quarter compared to net income of $15 million, and year-to-date was $53 million compared to $40 million.\n  * Net income per diluted share was $0.32 in the third quarter compared to $0.26, and was $0.89 per diluted share year-to-date compared to $0.68.\n  * Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 for the third quarter was $23 million compared to $27 million and year-to-date was $76 million, compared to $60 million.\n\n\n\nMichael Kirban, the Company's Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, stated, \"I am very proud of our team and our performance during the third quarter. The coconut water category remains one of the fastest growing categories in the beverage aisle, and we believe this growth is being fueled by our focus as the category leader in driving increased household adoption and new consumption occasions. Our reduced inventory availability during most of the quarter limited our ability to meet consumer demand. With an improving inventory situation, I expect accelerated growth for the balance of the year. Based on our expectation for continued strong category growth in 2025, I could not be more excited for what is to come.\"\n\nMartin Roper, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “Our sales performance in the quarter was affected by our inventory flow, which was lower than we had planned due to the difficulty in obtaining ocean freight containers that started in the second quarter. We are pleased that we have weathered these shortages and, in late September, saw our product flow and availability in market improving. Based on continued strong category growth and improved inventory levels, we are raising our full year guidance for net sales and adjusted EBITDA.\"\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results**\n\nNet sales decreased $5 million, or 4%, to $133 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $138 million in the prior year period. The decrease in net sales was driven by declines in private label case equivalent (\"CE\") volume which more than offset the _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water CE volume growth. The decline in private label was due to the reduction in private label oil sales, coupled with lower private label water volumes due primarily to supply constraints.\n\nGross profit was $52 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $56 million in the prior year period. Gross margin of 39% in the third quarter of 2024 decreased from 41% in the prior year period. Gross profit decrease was driven by lower overall volumes and increased transportation costs, which were partially offset by increased _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water net pricing and price/mix effects in private label.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in the third quarter of 2024 were $31 million, compared to $33 million in the prior year period. The decrease was largely due to the timing of marketing investments, which was partially offset by higher year on year personnel expenses.\n\nNet income was $19 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $15 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Net income benefited from a gain on mark to market adjustment on derivative instruments, lower SG&A expenses and higher interest income driven by higher cash investments compared to the prior year period, partly offset by lower year-on-year gross profit.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 for the third quarter of 2024 was $23 million, compared to $27 million in the prior year period. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 was primarily driven by lower gross profit resulting primarily from reduced volume and higher transportation costs, which were partially offset by higher _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water net pricing, price/mix effects in private label, and lower SG&A.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $157 million, compared to $133 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Inventories as of September 30, 2024 totaled $65 million. On September 30, 2024, there were 56,731,839 shares of common stock outstanding.\n\nOn October 30, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $40 million of the Company's common stock. As of September 30, 2024, and to date, the Company has repurchased a total of 534,246 shares for an aggregate value of $12.8 million at an average share price of $23.97 with 112,702 shares repurchased during the most recent quarter.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Full Year Outlook**\n\nThe Company is raising its full year guidance for net sales and adjusted EBITDA:\n\n  * Expect 2024 net sales to be between $505 million and $515 million, with projected _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water and private label coconut water volume growth, being offset by expected decreases in private label coconut oil business and price/mix effects.\n  * Full year gross margin expected to be between 37% and 39%, with recent increases on certain ocean freight routes expected to adversely affect gross margins in the fourth quarter.\n  * SG&A expenses expected to be flat to slightly down versus 2023.\n  * Forecasting adjusted EBITDA in the range of $80 million to $84 million.2\n\n\n\nUncertainty and instability of the current operating environment, global economies, and geopolitical landscape could affect this outlook and our future results.\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures herein for further discussion and reconciliation of this measure to GAAP measures.\n\n(2) GAAP Net Income 2024 outlook is not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details** The Vita Coco Company will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss these results.

These non-GAAP measures are a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.\n\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including but not limited to, statements regarding our future financial and operating performance, including our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance, our strategy, projected costs, prospects, expectations, plans, objectives of management, supply chain predictions, customer and supplier relationships, and expected net sales and category share growth.\n\nThe forward-looking statements in this release are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties or other factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") as such factors may be updated from time to time and which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and the Investor Relations page of our website at https://investors.thevitacococompany.com. Any forward-looking statements contained in this press release speak only as of the date hereof and accordingly undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.

(NASDAQ:COCO) (“Vita Coco” or “the Company”), a leading high-growth platform of better-for-you beverage brands, today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024.\n\n**Second Quarter and Year-To-Date 2024 Highlights**\n\n  * Net sales grew 3% in the second quarter to $144 million and 3% year-to-date to $256 million.\n  * _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water net sales growth of 4% in the second quarter and 3% year-to-date.\n  * Gross profit was $59 million in the second quarter, an increase of $8 million and $106 million year-to-date, an increase of $21 million.\n  * Gross Margin was 41% of net sales in the second quarter compared to 37% of net sales, and 41% of net sales year-to-date as compared to 34% of net sales.\n  * Net income was $19 million, in the second quarter compared to net income of $18 million, and year-to-date was $33 million compared to $25 million.\n  * Net income per diluted share was $0.32 in the second quarter compared to $0.31, and was $0.57 per diluted share year-to-date compared to $0.42.\n  * Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 was $32 million compared to $24 million for the second quarter. Year-to-date Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 was $53 million, compared to $33 million.\n\n\n\nMichael Kirban, the Company’s Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, stated, “I am very proud of our team and the strong financial performance that we delivered in the second quarter. Our focus and investment to expand consumption occasions for coconut water contributed to strong performance for the category and for our flagship _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water brand, which year-to-date has grown 11% in dollar sales in Circana US MULO+C measured channels. Importantly, during the quarter, we saw growth rate acceleration in the US retail scan data for our brand which grew 14%. The organization's ability to drive brand growth through strong retail execution and creative marketing programs, while continuing to improve profitability and cash generation at the same time, is something that every member of the team should be proud of. The coconut water category remains very healthy and one of the fastest growing categories in US beverages. Our team continues to deliver strong results at retail across our major markets. We remain committed to continuing to grow the coconut water category, and I could not be more excited for what is to come.”\n\nMartin Roper, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are pleased with this quarter’s results of 3% net sales growth and with our scan data growth, despite inventory challenges due to delays in product shipments caused by temporary headwinds in ocean freight availability and transit times. Our second quarter branded net sales were up, while private label was down slightly, as strong private label coconut water growth was partially offset by the previously communicated expected decrease in our private label coconut oil shipments. Net income of $19 million, and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $32 million, benefited from improved gross margins, driven primarily by lower transportation costs than last year. Based on a continuation of current trends, we are reaffirming our full year guidance, and we expect the flow of product should allow us to rebuild retail and distributor inventories to more normal levels by the end of the year, which we believe sets us up for a strong 2025. We remain focused on driving long term growth of the coconut water category and our brands.”\n\n**Second Quarter 2024 Consolidated Results**\n\nNet sales increased $4 million, or 3%, to $144 million for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024, compared to $140 million in the prior year period. The increase in net sales was driven by improved volume and net pricing of _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water and growth in private label case equivalent (“CE”) volume, which were partially offset by price/mix impacts from private label products.\n\nGross profit was $59 million for the second quarter of 2024, compared to $51 million in the prior year period. Gross margin of 41% in the second quarter of 2024 increased from 37% in the prior year period. Gross profit increase was driven by gross margin improvement due primarily to decreased finished goods and transportation costs, increased _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water pricing, price/mix effects in private label, and increased net sales.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses in the second quarter of 2024 were $29 million, compared to $30 million in the prior year period. The decrease was largely due to the timing of marketing investments which was partially offset by higher year on year personnel expenses.\n\nNet income was $19 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2024, compared to net income of $18 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, in the prior year period. Net income benefited from strong gross profit growth and slightly lower SG&A expenses.\n\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA1 for the second quarter of 2024 was $32 million, compared to $24 million in the prior year period. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA1 was primarily driven by gross profit improvement resulting primarily from improved finished goods and transportation costs, higher _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water net pricing, price/mix effects in private label, and increased net sales.\n\n**Balance Sheet**\n\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $150 million, compared to $133 million as of December 31, 2023. There was no debt as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Inventories as of June 30, 2024 totaled $45 million. On June 30, 2024, there were 56,775,369 shares of common stock outstanding.\n\nOn October 30, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $40 million of the Company’s common stock. As of June 30, 2024, and to date, the Company has repurchased a total of 421,544 shares for an aggregate value of $10 million at an average share price of $23.72 with no shares repurchased during the most recent quarter.\n\n**Fiscal Year 2024 Full Year Outlook**\n\nThe Company is reaffirming its full year guidance:\n\n  * Expect 2024 net sales to be between $500 million and $510 million, with projected _Vita Coco_ Coconut Water and private label coconut water volume growth, being offset by expected decreases in private label coconut oil business and price/mix effects.\n  * Full year gross margin expected to be between 37% and 39%, with recent increases on certain ocean freight routes expected to adversely affect gross margins in the second half. This impact is expected to be most severe in the fourth quarter.\n  * SG&A expenses expected to be approximately flat to up slightly versus 2023.\n  * Forecasting Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $76 million to $82 million.2\n\n\n\nUncertainty and instability of the current operating environment, global economies, and geopolitical landscape could affect this outlook and our future results.\n\n**Footnotes:**\n\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization as adjusted for certain items as set forth in the reconciliation table of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP information and is a measure calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures herein for further discussion and reconciliation of this measure to GAAP measures.\n\n(2) GAAP Net Income 2024 outlook is not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Details** The Vita Coco Company will host a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. ET today to discuss these results.

These non-GAAP measures are a key metric used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.\n\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.\n\n**Forward-Looking Statements**\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
