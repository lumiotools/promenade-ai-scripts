(NASDAQ: TNYA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying causes of heart disease, today announced that the first patient has been dosed with TN-401 gene therapy in the RIDGE-1 Phase 1b clinical trial at the University of California, San Francisco. Tenaya currently anticipates sharing initial data from the RIDGE-1 trial in 2025.\n\nTN-401 is being developed for the treatment of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC, also known as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy or ACM) caused by mutations in the _plakophilin-2_ (_PKP2)_ gene. _PKP2_ gene mutations result in insufficient levels of critical proteins needed to maintain the structural integrity and cell-to-cell signaling of heart muscle cells. TN-401 gene replacement therapy is designed to deliver a functional _PKP2_ gene into heart muscle cells using an adeno associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) capsid. In preclinical studies, the new, healthy _PKP2_ gene was successfully integrated into heart cells where it produced the missing protein to slow or even reverse the course of disease. Compared to untreated _in vivo_ knock-out models, TN-401 normalized heart rhythms, reversed disease progression and extended survival following a single dose.\n\n“People living with ARVC frequently experience dangerous arrhythmias and are at risk for developing heart failure, cardiac arrest and sudden death. To minimize their risk, ARVC patients live with significant activity restrictions, take chronic medications, and require interventions that together negatively impact their quality of life but don’t address the underlying problem of a defective gene,” said Vasanth Vedantham, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Cardiac Electrophysiologist, Director of Cardiovascular Genetics at the University of California, San Francisco and an investigator for the RIDGE-1 Phase 1b clinical trial. “ _PKP2_ genetic mutations are the most common single gene cause of ARVC and unlike existing treatments for ARVC, TN-401 gene therapy seeks to directly address the underlying cause of disease by delivering a fully functional copy of _PKP2_ to the heart.”\n\nThe RIDGE-1 Phase 1b clinical trial is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalation study being conducted in the U.S. and UK. RIDGE-1 will assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-401. The trial will seek to enroll up to fifteen adults who have been diagnosed with _PKP2-_ associated ARVC, have an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and are at increased risk for arrhythmias as determined by premature ventricular contraction count during screening.\n\nThe first dose of TN-401 being assessed in the RIDGE-1 clinical trial is 3E13 vg/kg, a dose that was associated with near maximal efficacy in preclinical studies. The first three patients will be dosed on a sequential basis. Once three patients have been dosed at the 3E13 vg/kg level, a panel of independent safety reviewers will advise on plans to dose escalate and/or expand enrollment of the initial cohort dosing in parallel.\n\n“Initiation of this first-in-human study of TN-401 is a significant milestone for Tenaya and we are grateful for the ongoing support received from our trial sites, advocacy organizations, patients and families in our efforts to advance a novel gene replacement therapy for PKP2-associated ARVC,” said Whit Tingley, M.D., Ph.D., Tenaya’s Chief Medical Officer. “We believe TN-401 has best-in-class potential due to its differentiated construct, which utilizes an AAV9 capsid to deliver a fully functioning _PKP2_ gene directly to heart cells. We selected AAV9 capsid due to its extensive track record and in preclinical studies it outperformed other capsids and TN-401 restored PKP2 levels in a knockout model, leading to reductions in arrhythmia frequency and severity, and halted disease progression.”\n\nThe RIDGE-1 clinical trial is currently enrolling patients at six leading U.S. centers specializing in ARVC care.

In 2022, Tenaya initiated a non-interventional global natural history and seroprevalence study of adults with _PKP2_ -assocated ARVC ([NCT06311708](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=xD1e5pOULjxQtr5JqbDaG61OvRK-RlJ5JK-Jf3WbkWHDIkDN-XQJo6xv0RfqrI23LSod3uftVuvS23BQdcyslOIkgJdhsATtyZGN-xkAL6bA38PCECBSmtF29CG_kf_8zOGkhXqiKCHMftivu_IJRw==) _)_. The RIDGE study continues to enroll participants at more than 20 clinical sites in the U.S., UK, France, Germany, Italy and Sweden.\n\n**About**** _PKP2_****-Associated ARVC** _Plakophilin-2_ (_PKP2_) mutations are the most common genetic cause of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC, also known as arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy or ACM), estimated to represent approximately 40 percent of the overall ARVC population. The prevalence of  _PKP2_ -associated ARVC is estimated at more than 70,000 people in the U.S. alone.\n\nIn  _PKP2_ -associated ARVC, mutations of the _PKP2_ gene results in insufficient expression of a protein needed for the proper functioning of the desmosomal complex that maintains physical connections and electrical signaling between heart muscle cells. As the desmosome structure degrades, cardiac muscle cells are replaced by fibrofatty tissue and electrical pulses in the heart become unstable, resulting in irregular heart rhythms. ARVC symptoms include arrhythmias, palpitations, lightheadedness, dizziness and fainting. It is typically diagnosed before age 40, and sudden cardiac arrest due to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias is frequently the first manifestation of disease. Current treatments include anti-arrhythmic medications, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and ablation procedures, which do not address the underlying genetic cause of disease.\n\n**About TN-401 Gene Therapy** TN-401 is an investigational AAV9-based gene therapy being developed for the treatment of ARVC due to mutations in the _PKP2_ gene. AAV9 was selected as the vector for delivery of Tenaya’s _PKP2_ gene therapy based on its extensive clinical and commercial safety record and demonstrated ability to target heart muscle cells. In preclinical studies, Tenaya has shown that a single dose of TN-401 restored healthy levels of PKP2 protein, normalized heart rhythms, improved right and left ventricular size and function and extended survival.\n\nTenaya is conducting the RIDGE-1 Phase 1b clinical trial of TN-401 in patients with _PKP2_ -associated ARVC. To support TN-401’s clinical development, the company is currently enrolling the RIDGE global non-interventional study to collect natural history and AAV9 antibody (seroprevalence) data among ARVC patients carrying _PKP2_ gene mutations. TN-401 has received Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations from the FDA.\n\n**About Tenaya Therapeutics** Tenaya Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to a bold mission: to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying drivers of heart disease. Tenaya employs a suite of integrated internal capabilities, including modality agnostic target validation, capsid engineering and manufacturing, to generate a portfolio of genetic medicines aimed at the treatment of both rare genetic disorders and more prevalent heart conditions. Tenaya’s pipeline includes TN-201, a gene therapy for _MYBPC3_ -associated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), TN-401, a gene therapy for _PKP2_ -associated arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), TN-301, a small molecule HDAC6 inhibitor intended for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), and multiple early-stage programs in preclinical development.

(NASDAQ: TNYA), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a mission to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying causes of heart disease, today reported financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, and provided a corporate update.\n\n“We are pleased to share meaningful progress on our lead TN-201 gene therapy program during the third quarter, including an early positive safety update and DSMB clearance to dose escalate to Cohort 2 in the MyPEAK-1 study. We remain on track to report early clinical data from the first three patients from Cohort 1 of this study in December,” said Faraz Ali, Chief Executive Officer of Tenaya. “We also shared updates to MyPEAK-1 study eligibility criteria that are expected to enhance enrollment and adjustments to the timing and frequency of cardiac biopsies that are expected to support deeper insights into TN-201 expression going forward. Overall, these updates create positive momentum going into the year-end data release, as well as for future updates in 2025.”\n\n**Business and Program Updates** _TN-201 – Gene Therapy for MYBPC3-Associated Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM)_\n\n  * Tenaya completed dosing of the first three patients at the 3E13 vg/kg dose (Cohort 1) in [MyPEAK-1](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05836259?term=TN-201&rank=1) clinical trial with no unexpected events or toxicities associated with study drug observed. Safety data from Cohort 1 were reviewed by an independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) that recommended that Tenaya proceed with planned dose escalation to 6E13 vg/kg (Cohort 2), per protocol. \n    * MyPEAK-1 is a Phase 1b/2 multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation trial designed to assess safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-201 in treating patients with HCM caused by mutations in the MYBPC3 gene. The study is being conducted in the U.S. with ten clinical sites activated.\n  * Tenaya implemented changes to the MyPEAK-1 protocol intended to support future development, including adding a baseline biopsy; expanding trial participant eligibility to include obstructive HCM patients and patients without implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); and increasing the potential number of total patients enrolled in the dose expansion portion of the clinical trial.\n  * Tenaya anticipates sharing interim results from MyPEAK-1, including safety and tolerability, analyses of cardiac biopsy, as well as changes from baseline in cardiac biomarkers, from the first cohort of patients in December 2024.\n  * At the virtual HCM Society’s Scientific Sessions in September, Tenaya [presented data](https://www.tenayatherapeutics.com/wp-content/uploads/HCMS2024-Podium-Pediatriac-MYBPC3-HCM-SHaRe-Research.pdf) from a study conducted in partnership with the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) describing the higher disease burden faced by _MYBPC3_ -associated pediatric HCM patients, with 50% experiencing significant morbidity by age 40.\n  * In July, TN-201 was granted rare pediatric disease designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of  _MYBPC3_ -associated HCM in individuals under the age of 18. Tenaya has enrolled more than 200 retrospective and prospective patients across 29 sites in the [MyClimb Natural History Study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05112237) intended to better characterize _MYBPC3_ -associated pediatric HCM patients.\n\n\n\n_TN-401 – Gene Therapy for PKP2-Associated Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC)_\n\n  * Tenaya has activated six clinical sites in [RIDGE](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06228924?cond=TN-401&rank=1)[TM](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06228924?cond=TN-401&rank=1)[ -1](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06228924?cond=TN-401&rank=1) clinical trial and has been screening potential patients for participation. RIDGE-1 is a global multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation trial designed to assess safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a one-time intravenous infusion of TN-401 for the treatment of ARVC caused by mutations to the PKP2 gene. Tenaya has also activated more than 20 sites in 6 countries in the [RIDGE](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06311708) seroprevalence and natural history study.\n  * In October 2024, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued U.S Patent Number 12,104,165 (the ’165 patent). The ’165 patent is directed to a method of treating an arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) with an AAV9 virion encoding the PKP2 protein. The ’165 patent provides method of treatment protection for Tenaya’s PKP2 gene therapy program for the treatment of ARVC and is expected to expire no earlier than 2040.\n\n\n\n_Corporate_\n\n  * In August 2024, Tenaya entered into a $45 million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). Tenaya has not drawn on the credit facility and is under no obligation to do so.\n\n\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights**\n\n  * **Cash Position and Guidance:** As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities were $79.5 million. Tenaya estimates sufficient funds are available to support planned company operations into the second half of 2025.\n\n\n  * **Research & Development (R&D) Expenses: **R&D expenses were $20.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $23.1 million for the comparable period in 2023. Non-cash stock-based compensation included in R&D expense was $2.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $1.9 million for the comparable period in 2023.\n  * **General & Administrative (G&A) Expenses: **G&A expenses were $6.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $7.8 million for the comparable period in 2023. Non-cash stock-based compensation included in G&A expense was $1.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to $2.2 million for the comparable period in 2023.\n  * **Net Loss:** Net loss was $25.6 million, or $0.30 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of $29.1 million, or $0.39 per share, for the comparable period in 2023.\n\n\n\n**About Tenaya Therapeutics** Tenaya Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company committed to a bold mission: to discover, develop and deliver potentially curative therapies that address the underlying drivers of heart disease.
