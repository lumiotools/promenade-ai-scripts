(NASDAQ: NARI) (“Inari”), a medical device company with a mission to treat and transform the lives of patients suffering from venous and other diseases, today announced positive results from the prospective PEERLESS Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing FlowTriever to catheter-directed thrombolytics (CDT). The results were presented by Dr. Wissam Jaber, Professor of Medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and Co-Global Principal Investigator (PI), during the Late-Breaking Clinical Trial Session at the 2024 Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) Annual Scientific Symposium in Washington, D.C. In recognition of the clinical relevance of the study, results were also simultaneously published in _Circulation_ , the premier peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association (AHA).\n\nPEERLESS met its primary composite endpoint (win ratio 5.01, p<0.001), driven by patients experiencing significantly fewer clinical deteriorations or therapy escalations, fewer ICU admissions, and shorter ICU lengths of stay with FlowTriever versus CDT. Patients also had faster recovery of clinical symptoms and hemodynamics, shorter hospital length of stay, and fewer 30-day readmissions.\n\n“These results are crucial to guiding optimal PE treatment decisions, providing strong evidence that FlowTriever may reduce clinical deterioration and the need for reintervention through more effective early thrombus resolution,” said Dr. Jaber. “As the only randomized trial evaluating mechanical thrombectomy in PE, PEERLESS allows us to now confidently say that treatment with FlowTriever is safe, effective, and superior to CDT.”\n\nThe PEERLESS study was conducted across 57 centers worldwide, enrolling 550 intermediate-risk PE patients randomized to receive either FlowTriever thrombectomy or CDT. The primary RCT cohort excluded patients with absolute contraindications to thrombolytics and enrolled very few patients with relative contraindications. In addition to Dr. Jaber, study leadership includes Co-global PI Dr. Carin Gonsalves, Professor of Radiology and Co-Director of the Division of Interventional Radiology at Thomas Jefferson University, and European PI Prof. Stefan Stortecky, Associate Professor, Bern University Hospital, Inselspital, Switzerland.\n\n“These findings underscore FlowTriever’s unique effectiveness in helping PE patients feel better more rapidly,” said Dr. Gonsalves. “What stands out is that large-bore thrombectomy and blood return with the FlowTriever system produced superior clinical outcomes and maintained an excellent safety profile. This shows we can facilitate faster recovery from PE, discharge patients sooner, and do so without additional risks.”\n\n**PEERLESS RCT Highlights:**\n\n  * **Reduced Deteriorations/Bailouts:** FlowTriever patients had 3X fewer clinical deteriorations and/or therapy escalations to bailout compared to CDT.\n  * **Faster Recovery:** FlowTriever patients had greater improvement of clinical symptoms and hemodynamics at 24 hours, and fewer 30-day readmissions.\n  * **Decreased Hospital Resource Use:** FlowTriever patients had significantly less ICU admission, ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS.\n  * **Conclusive FlowTriever Safety Profile:** In the FlowTriever arm, there were 0 patient deaths at discharge or 7 days, 0 deteriorations related to cardiac arrest, high-grade AV block, or respiratory failure, and low 0.4% all-cause mortality at 30-day follow-up.\n\n\n\n“PEERLESS, the first major randomized PE study in over a decade, reiterates our commitment to practice- and guideline-changing research and sets the new standard for clinically meaningful endpoints,” said Dr. Thomas Tu, Inari’s Chief Medical Officer. “The results of this study position FlowTriever as the primary interventional tool for intermediate-risk PE. PEERLESS is the first in a series of randomized controlled studies that Inari and others are bringing to light, kicking off the golden age of PE research. I wish to thank our dedicated steering committee and investigators for bringing this trial to reality and contributing to its ongoing impact on patient care.”\n\nView the PEERLESS Results Summary Presentation: [Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eHVpuSCzgVO-DXbu-MPCL_nGc_kZHgYcZcENXuaiJRJLyqaTTJ4wzRNV0MEood0qxtqpg8z8QtoAsIA4dsHSfP0ZKmlptNI3PIHncXZfzBFAbmlHwSpkkcke2CkaUkXZ)\n\nAccepted for simultaneous publication in Circulation: [Link](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=eHVpuSCzgVO-DXbu-MPCL3yxEJyqx4n-grJaZFIxNOZO2XRSYUd2ZePeXy1v-CdI-AxbwYn3xklP8PlbAg8ukq9gxc5oK8nyZXAhcY_sE4au2YTeMUBRo5dhcrQY33Ik)\n\n**About Inari Medical, Inc.** Patients first.

(NASDAQ: NARI) (“Inari”), a medical device company with a mission to treat and transform the lives of patients suffering from venous and other diseases, today reported financial results for its third quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n**Third Quarter Financial and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n  * Generated revenue of $153 million in Q3 of 2024, up 21% over the same quarter of last year.\n  * GAAP operating loss was $13.6 million in Q3 of 2024, compared to a $2.1 million operating income in the same quarter of last year.\n  * Non-GAAP operating loss was $0.4 million in Q3 of 2024, compared to a $4.8 million non-GAAP operating income in the same quarter of last year.\n  * Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $112 million as of Q3 of 2024.\n  * Received acceptance for the PEERLESS study to be presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the 2024 Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) Annual Scientific Symposium on October 29th.\n\n\n\n“We continue to drive strong performance across the entire Inari portfolio as we advance our leading position in large, underserved vascular markets,” said Drew Hykes, CEO of Inari Medical. “Our products are performing well, and looking ahead, we have several important catalysts on the horizon. On that note, we look forward to the presentation of our PEERLESS data at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) Symposium tomorrow, our upcoming full market release of Artix following FDA clearance earlier this month, and our plans to offer Inari solutions in Japan and China. We’ve never been more committed to our mission of addressing unmet patient needs with purpose-built solutions.”\n\n**Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results** Revenue was $153.4 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 21.4% compared to $126.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase over the prior year quarter was driven primarily by an expansion in our sales territories, opening of new accounts, increase in adoption of our procedures, global commercial expansion, and introduction of new products.\n\nGross profit was $133.5 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to $111.9 million for the third quarter of 2023. Gross margin was 87.1% for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 88.5% for the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year change was primarily due to product mix, the ramp up costs associated with new products, and increasing internationalization of the business.\n\nOperating expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $147.1 million, compared to $109.8 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase was mainly driven by personnel-related expenses, including commissions and share-based compensation associated with increased headcount to fund the expansion of the commercial, research and development, clinical, and support organizations; change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability; capitalized software impairment and related costs; professional fees including legal expenses; amortization expense related to an intangible asset acquired in the LimFlow acquisition, and travel related costs.\n\nGAAP operating loss was $13.6 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a $2.1 million GAAP operating income for the third quarter of 2023. Sequentially, GAAP operating loss improved by $8.8 million.\n\nNon-GAAP operating loss was $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP operating income was $4.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. Sequentially, non-GAAP operating loss improved by $12.8 million. The following items were excluded from the non-GAAP operating loss in the third quarter of 2024: change in fair value of contingent consideration liability of $6.6 million, capitalized software impairment and related costs of $3.8 million, acquired intangible asset amortization of $2.5 million, and acquisition-related expenses of $0.3 million. The following items were excluded from the non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2023: acquisition-related expenses of $2.7 million.\n\nNet loss was $18.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 and net loss per share was $0.31 on a weighted-average basic and diluted share count of 58.4 million, compared to net income of $3.2 million and net income per share of $0.06 on a weighted-average basic share count of 57.4 million and $0.05 on a weighted-average diluted share count of 58.6 million, respectively, in the same period of the prior year.\n\n**Full Year 2024 Revenue Guidance and Operating Income Outlook**\n\n  * Inari raises full year 2024 revenue guidance to $601.5 million to $604.5 million, an increase of $3.5 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance range of $594.5 million to $604.5 million, reflecting growth of approximately 21.9% to 22.5% over 2023.\n  * The company continues to expect to reach sustained operating profitability in the first half of 2025.\n\n\n\n**Webcast and Conference Call Information** Inari Medical will host a conference call to discuss the third quarter 2024 financial results after market close on October 28, 2024 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time / 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. The conference call can be accessed live by dialing (844) 825-9789 for domestic callers or (412) 317-5180 for international callers. The live webinar and presentation may be accessed by visiting the Events Section of the Inari investor relations website at ir.inarimedical.com.\n\n**Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures** This press release contains references to non-GAAP operating income (loss), which is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. This means that non-GAAP operating income (loss) is determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). As used by Inari, non-GAAP operating income (loss) excludes from GAAP operating income (loss) the following items: amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related costs, fair value adjustment to our contingent consideration liability and capitalized software impairment and related costs. We present the non-GAAP operating income (loss) to exclude these charges because we believe these charges are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of acquisitions, such as our LimFlow acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, as well as other non-recurring factors such as wind down of certain projects. Our management believes the presentation of non-GAAP operating income (loss) is useful because it provides meaningful comparisons to prior periods and provides visibility to our underlying operating performance and an additional means to evaluate the cost and expense trends excluding the impact of these acquisition-related items and other non-recurring transactions, which are not related to our core business operations.\n\nOur definition of non-GAAP operating income (loss) may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. Non-GAAP operating income (loss) should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP operating income (loss) to GAAP operating income (loss), which has been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release.\n\n**About Inari Medical, Inc.** Patients first.
