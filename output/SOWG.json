          "content": "Investor Presentation\nAugust 2024\nDisclaimers\nThis Presentation may not be reproduced, forwarded to any person or published, in whole or in part.\nIndustry and Market Data\nWe include in this Presentation statements regarding factors that have impacted our industry. Such statements are statements of belief and are based on industry data and forecasts that we have obtained from internal company surveys, publicly available information, industry publications and\nsurveys and third-party studies. Industry publications, surveys and forecasts generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but there can be no assurance as to the accuracy or completeness of such information. Certain market,\nranking and industry data included in this Presentation, including the size of certain markets and our size or position and the positions of our competitors within these markets, including our services relative to our competitors, are based on estimates of our management. These estimates have\nbeen derived from our management’s knowledge and experience in the market in which we operate, as well as information obtained from internal company surveys, industry publications and surveys, third-party studies and other publicly available information related to the market in which we\noperate. Unless otherwise noted, all of our market share and market position information presented in this Presentation is an approximation based on management’s knowledge. In addition, while we believe that the industry information included herein is generally reliable, such information is\ninherently imprecise. While we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the industry data presented herein, our estimates involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors.\nTrademarks\nThis Presentation includes our trademarks and trade names which are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are our property. This Presentation also contains trademarks, trade names and service marks of other companies, which are the property of their respective owners.\nSolely for convenience, trademarks, trade names and service marks referred to in this Presentation may appear without the ®, or SM symbols, but such references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our rights\nor the right of the applicable licensor to these trademarks, trade names and service marks. We do not intend our use or display of other parties’ trademarks, trade names or service marks to imply, and such use or display should not be construed to imply, a relationship with or endorsement or\nsponsorship of us by these other parties.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements made in this Presentation and oral statements made from time to time by representatives of the Company are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements\ncontained in this Presentation other than statements of historical facts, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, our strategic and financial initiatives, our business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward looking\nstatements. Forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of words such as “estimate,” “projects,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “forecasts,” “plans,” “intends,” “believes,” “seeks,” “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “future,” “propose,” “potential,” “target,” “goal,” “objective,” “outlook”\nand variations of these words or similar expressions (or the negative versions of such words or expressions) are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the financial position, business strategy and\nthe plans and objectives of management for future operations of the Company. These statements are based on various assumptions, whether or not identified in this communication, and on the current expectations of the Company’s management and are not predictions of actual performance.\nThese forward-looking statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to serve as, and must not be relied on by any investor as a guarantee, an assurance, a prediction or a definitive statement of fact or probability. These forward-looking statements are not\nguarantees of future performance, conditions or results, and involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside the control of the parties, that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those\ndiscussed in the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking events and circumstances are inherently uncertain and may not occur, and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not rely upon any\nforward-looking statements as predictions of future events.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Metrics\nThis Presentation contains certain financial information that does not adhere to the generally acceptable accounting practice (“GAAP”) in the United States. These non-GAAP financial measures include Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) excluding\ndepreciation and amortization with additional adjustments for stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash or non-recurring items. Non-GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for GAAP financial measures and are provided only as supplement to other information. These non-\nGAAP measures are an addition to, and not a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that non-GAAP\nmeasures of financial results (including on a forward-looking basis) provide useful supplemental information to investors about the Company and are helpful in highlighting trends in its core operating performance compared to other measures, which can differ significantly depending on long-\nterm strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments, among other things. In addition, other companies may calculate non-GAAP measures differently, or may use other measures to calculate their financial performance,\nand therefore, the Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Please refer to slide 16 for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest corresponding GAAP measures.\nPAGE 2\nManagement Team\nIra Goldfarb Claudia Goldfarb Brendon Fischer\nCo-Founder & Chairman Co-Founder & CEO Interim CFO\n• 30+ years of retail, manufacturing and freeze • Significant expertise in food safety, supply • 20+ years of finance and investment\ndrying experience chain and product innovation analysis experience\n• Proven track record of success in freeze drying\ndesign and production\nPAGE 3\nWhat is Freeze Dried Candy?\nFreeze drying removes moisture from the product, adding a crunch perfect for snackability and\nconcentrating the flavor while extending the shelf-life by years\n1 • Hyper Crunchy\nBefore After\n• Crunchy, not chewy.
