The 1-for-15 ratio is within the range approved by the Company’s stockholders at the Special Meeting of Stockholders held on September 19, 2024.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split is intended to bring the Company into compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Reverse Stock Split is expected to become effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on October 4, 2024 (the “Effective Time”), and the Common Stock is expected to begin trading on a post-split basis when the market opens on October 4, 2024, under the new CUSIP number 86323X205. The Common Stock will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “STRM.”\n\nAt the Effective Time, each 15 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding will be automatically combined into one share of Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and, in lieu thereof, the Company will pay each stockholder of record at the time of effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split who otherwise would be entitled to receive fractional shares (because such stockholder holds a number of pre-Reverse Stock Split shares not evenly divisible by 15) an amount in cash equal to the fraction to which the stockholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the closing sales price of the Common Stock as reported on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the date on which the Effective Time occurs.\n\nThe Reverse Stock Split will also apply to any outstanding securities or rights convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, Common Stock and all references to such Common Stock in agreements, arrangements, documents and plans relating thereto or any option or right to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be references to the Common Stock or options or rights to purchase or acquire shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split. Additionally, all equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split will be proportionately adjusted.\n\nComputershare Inc. (“Computershare”), the Company’s transfer agent, is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive post-split shares. Stockholders owning shares through a bank, broker or other nominee will have their positions adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split and will receive payment for any fractional shares in accordance with their respective bank’s, broker’s, or nominee’s particular processes. Stockholders may direct any questions to Computershare at (800) 962-4284.\n\nAdditional information concerning the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Company’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 19, 2024.\n\n**About Streamline Health**\n\nStreamline Health Solutions, Inc.

For the six months ended July 31, 2024, revenue totaled $8.8 million compared to $11.1 million during the same period in fiscal 2023. The change in total revenue was attributable to previously announced client non-renewals offset by successful implementation of new SaaS contracts.\n\nSaaS revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $3.1 million, 69% of total revenue, compared to SaaS revenue of $3.5 million, 61% of total revenue during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. For the six months ended July 31, 2024, SaaS revenue totaled $5.8 million, 66% of total revenue, compared to $6.7 million, 61% of total revenue, during the same period of fiscal 2023. As previously reported, the Company had a SaaS contract which did not renew at the end of its 2023 fiscal year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the revenue recognized from the SaaS contract that did not renew, SaaS revenue grew 19% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and 21% during the six months ended July 31, 2024, compared to the same period in fiscal 2023.\n\nNet loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was ($2.8 million) compared to a net loss of ($2.5 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increased net loss during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 reflected lower total revenues, higher interest expense and non-cash valuation adjustments offset by a $1.7 million reduction in operating expenses resulting from the Company’s strategic restructuring executed during fiscal 2023. Net loss for the six months ended July 31, 2024 was ($5.5 million) compared to ($5.4 million) in the same period of fiscal 2023. The slight increase in net loss resulted from lower revenues and higher interest and valuation adjustment expenses offset by cost savings achieved through the previously announced strategic restructuring.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of July 31, 2024, were $3.5 million compared to $3.2 million as of January 31, 2024. The Company had no outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility as of July 31, 2024, compared to $1.5 million as of January 31, 2024.\n\n**Fiscal Second Quarter and Six Months Ended July 31, 2024 Non-GAAP Financial Results**\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was ($0.3 million) compared to ($0.9 million) during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2024, was ($1.0 million) compared to ($2.2 million) during the same period in fiscal 2023. The significant improvement of adjusted EBITDA despite lower total revenue is the result of the Company’s focus on the growth of its SaaS revenue solutions as well as significant cost savings achieved through the previously announced strategic restructuring.\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, the Company’s total Booked SaaS Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) was $13.6 million compared to $15.0 million as of January 31, 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company won new contracts which totaled $0.8 million of ACV and received notifications of non-renewals for contracts with aggregate ACV of $2.8 million. Clients gave various reasons for their non-renewal, including full outsourcing of health system revenue cycles. $10.7 million of the Booked SaaS ACV was implemented as of July 31, 2024 compared to $11.1 million as of January 31, 2024.\n\nBooked SaaS ACV represents the annualized value of all executed SaaS contracts, including contracts that have not been fully implemented as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the twelve months following the measurement date is renewed on its existing terms unless the Company has knowledge of the non-renewal.\n\nThe Company reiterated that it believes its adjusted EBITDA breakeven run rate is $15.5 million of implemented SaaS ARR, but due to the aforementioned client non-renewals, the Company has revised its expected timeline to achieve this run rate from the second half of fiscal 2024 to the second half of fiscal 2025. Due to the continued unpredictability of timing related to the closing of new contracts, the Company has not provided more specific guidance related to the timing of bookings.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“During the first half of this year we have expanded the value we provide to the healthcare revenue cycle through our product enhancements for workforce automation and opportunity identification,” stated Ben Stilwill, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “The Streamline team is focused on expanding our client footprint, maintaining a high caliber of client service, improving our solutions and progressing our financial goals and our mission to ensure our nation’s health systems are paid for all of the care they provide.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call on Thursday, September 12, 2024, at 9:00 AM ET to review results and provide a corporate update.

Streamline’s management also evaluates and makes operating decisions using various other measures. One such measure is adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Streamline’s management believes that this measure provides useful supplemental information regarding the performance of Streamline’s business operations.\n\nStreamline defines “adjusted EBITDA” as net earnings (loss) plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense of tangible and intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant non-recurring operating expenses, restructuring expenses, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and transactional related expenses including: gains and losses on debt and equity conversions, associate severances and related alignment expenses, associate inducements, and professional and advisory fees. A table reconciling this measure to “net loss,” to the extent relevant items were recognized in the periods covered, is included in this press release.\n\nBooked SaaS ACV represents the annualized value of all executed SaaS contracts, including contracts that have not been fully implemented, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the twelve months following the measurement date is renewed on its existing terms unless the Company has knowledge of the non-renewal. Booked SaaS ACV should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract execution start and end dates and renewal rates. Booked SaaS ACV is not intended to be a replacement for, or forecast of, revenue. There is no GAAP measure comparable to Booked SaaS ACV.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995**\n\nStatements made by Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements included herein.

The change in total revenue was attributable to previously announced client non-renewals offset by successful implementation of new SaaS contracts.\n\nSaaS revenue totaled $2.7 million and $3.2 million and represented 63% and 60% of total revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and 2023 respectively. As previously reported, the Company had a SaaS contract which did not renew at the end of its 2023 fiscal year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the revenue recognized from that contract SaaS revenue grew 22% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nNet loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was ($2.7 million) compared to a net loss of ($2.9 million) during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The improved net loss despite lower revenue resulted from cost savings achieved through the strategic restructuring executed during fiscal 2023 offset by higher interest expense and non-cash valuation adjustments.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of April 30, 2024 was $4.0 million compared to $3.2 million as of January 31, 2024. The Company had access to $2.0 million of liquidity through its revolving credit facility as of April 30, 2024, compared to $0.5 million as of January 31, 2024. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024 the Company closed a private placement of common stock, unsecured promissory notes and warrants resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.5 million.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was ($0.7 million) compared to ($1.3 million) during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The significant improvement of Adjusted EBITDA is the result of the Company’s focus on the growth of its SaaS revenue solutions as well as significant cost savings achieved through the previously announced strategic restructuring.\n\nAs of April 30, 2024, the Company’s total Booked SaaS Annual Contract Value (“ACV”) was $15.6 million compared to $15.0 million as of January 31, 2024. $11.6 million of the Booked SaaS ACV was implemented as of April 30, 2024 as compared to $11.1 million as of January 31, 2024. Subsequent to the end of the fiscal quarter, the Company successfully booked additional contracts and implemented existing contracts. As a result, as of June 11, 2024 booked SaaS ACV totaled $15.9 million and $13.1 million was implemented.\n\nBooked SaaS ACV represents the annualized value of all executed SaaS contracts, including contracts that have not been fully implemented as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the twelve months following the measurement date is renewed on its existing terms unless the Company has knowledge of the non-renewal.\n\nThe Company reiterated that it believes its adjusted EBITDA breakeven run rate is $15.5 million of SaaS ARR and that it expects to achieve this run rate during the second half of fiscal 2024. Due to the continued unpredictability of timing related to the closing of new contracts, the Company has not provided more specific guidance related to the timing of bookings.\n\n**Management Commentary**\n\n“As a result of executing contract implementations while expanding our footprint with new and existing clients we expect to achieve ongoing adjusted EBITDA profitability during the second half of this fiscal year,” stated Ben Stilwill, President and Chief Executive Officer, of the Company. “Furthermore, we continue to improve the impact of our existing solutions for clients by incorporating novel AI techniques furthering our mission to ensure our nation’s health systems are paid for all of the care they provide.”\n\n**Conference Call**\n\nThe Company will conduct a conference call on Wednesday, June 12, 2024, at 9:00 AM ET to review results and provide a corporate update.

Streamline’s management also evaluates and makes operating decisions using various other measures. One such measure is adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Streamline’s management believes that this measure provides useful supplemental information regarding the performance of Streamline’s business operations.\n\nStreamline defines “adjusted EBITDA” as net earnings (loss) plus interest expense, tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense of tangible and intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, significant non-recurring operating expenses, restructuring expenses, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and transactional related expenses including: gains and losses on debt and equity conversions, associate severances and related alignment expenses, associate inducements, and professional and advisory fees. A table reconciling this measure to “net loss,” to the extent relevant items were recognized in the periods covered, is included in this press release.\n\nBooked SaaS ACV represents the annualized value of all executed SaaS contracts, including contracts that have not been fully implemented, as of the measurement date, assuming any contract that expires during the twelve months following the measurement date is renewed on its existing terms unless the Company has knowledge of the non-renewal. Booked SaaS ACV should be viewed independently of revenue and does not represent revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP on an annualized basis, as it is an operating metric that can be impacted by contract execution start and end dates and renewal rates. Booked SaaS ACV is not intended to be a replacement for, or forecast of, revenue. There is no GAAP measure comparable to Booked SaaS ACV.\n\n**Safe Harbor Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995**\n\nStatements made by Streamline Health Solutions, Inc. that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements included herein.
