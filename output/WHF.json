We are working to optimize the outcomes for these specific credits, and the balance of our portfolio is generally stable and performing well. Although the broader lending market remains aggressive, we continue to see opportunities and source deals in areas of the market where there is less competition. Based on current market terms and conditions, we remain focused on certain segments of the lending market where we believe we have a competitive advantage and are selectively investing in credits with positive free cash flow, limited cyclicality, and strong owners. This is consistent with the rigorous underwriting standards that we adhere to regardless of market conditions.\"\n\n**Summary Information as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 (unaudited):**\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Three Months Ended** | **Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**($ in thousands except per share data)** | **September 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2024** | **$** | **%**  \nTotal investment income | $ | 22,851 | $ | 23,482 | (631) | (2.7)  \nTotal expenses, including excise tax | 13,697 | 14,190 | (493) | (3.5)  \nNet investment income and core net investment income(1) | 9,154 | 9,292 | (138) | (1.5)  \nNet investment income and core net investment income(1) per share | 0.394 | 0.400 | (0.006) | (1.5)  \nDistributions per share | 0.385 | 0.385 | - | -  \nNet realized gains (losses) | 39 | (93) | 132 | (141.9)  \nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) | (16,051) | (1,360) | (14,691) | 1,080.2  \nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations | (6,858) | 7,839 | (14,697) | (187.5)  \n**($ in thousands except per share data)** | **September 30, 2024** | **As of June 30, 2024** | **$** | **%**  \nTotal investments, at fair value(2) | $ | 654,338 | $ | 660,005 | (5,667) | (0.9)  \nSTRS JV total investments, at fair value | 309,797 | 324,844 | (15,047) | (4.6)  \nNet asset value per share | 12.77 | 13.45 | (0.68) | (5.1)  \n  \n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of September 30, 2024, the fair value of WhiteHorse Finance's investment portfolio was $654.3 million, compared with $660.0 million as of June 30, 2024.

Statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\n\n(1) \"Core net investment income\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that core net investment income provides useful information to investors and management because it reflects the Company's financial performance excluding (i) the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, (ii) the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and (iii) excise and other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additional information on core net investment income and a reconciliation of core net investment income to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net investment income, are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto.\n\n(2) Includes investments in WHF STRS Ohio Senior Loan Fund LLC (\"STRS JV\"), an unconsolidated joint venture, totaling $107.9 million, at fair value.\n\n(3) Based on total capital raised by H.I.G. Capital and affiliates.\n\n**SCHEDULE 1**\n\nAs a supplement to GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided information relating to core net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted to exclude the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and excise or other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). There were no excise or other income taxes related to net realized gains and losses for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income to core net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data): \n\n**September 30, 2024** | **September 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Amount** |  **Per Share** | **Amount** |  **Per Share**  \n**Amounts** | **Amounts**  \nNet investment income | $ | 9,154 | $ | 0.394 | $ | 10,813 | $ | 0.465  \nNet impact of costs associated with refinancing of indebtedness | - | - | - | -  \nAccrual for capital gains incentive fee | - | - | - | -  \nNet impact of excise tax expense related to net realized gains and losses | - | - | - | -  \nCore net investment income | $ | 9,154 | $ | 0.394 | $ | 10,813 | $ | 0.465  \n  \n**Contacts**  \n---  \nStuart Aronson  \nWhiteHorse Finance, Inc.  \n212-506-0500  \n_saronson@higwhitehorse.com_  \nor  \nJoyson Thomas  \nWhiteHorse Finance, Inc.  \n305-379-2322  \n_jthomas@higwhitehorse.com_  \nor  \nRobert BrinbergRose & Company212-257-5932 _whitehorse@roseandco.com_  \n  \n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY50435&sd=2024-11-07) View original content to download multimedia:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/whitehorse-finance-inc-announces-third-quarter-2024-earnings-results-and-declares-quarterly-distribution-of-0-385-per-share-302298454.html>\n\nSOURCE WhiteHorse Finance, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://whitehorsefinance.com/investors/press-releases/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://whitehorsefinance.com/faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://whitehorsefinance.com/contact/information-requests/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n1450 Brickell Avenue31st FloorMiami, FL 33131\n\n[(305) 381-6999](tel:305-381-6999) [FAX: (305) 379-2013](phone:305-379-2013)\n\ninvestorrelations@whitehorsefinance.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

In addition, the Company's board of directors has declared a distribution of $0.385 per share with respect to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. The distributions will be payable on October 2, 2024 to stockholders of record as of September 18, 2024. \n\nStuart Aronson, WhiteHorse Finance's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Despite some challenges with specific credits and elevated repayment activity, I am pleased to report that WhiteHorse generated another quarter of core net investment income well in excess of our regular dividend. We are generally seeing balanced activity across our portfolio in terms of credit performance and stability with markdowns partially offset by various net markups during the quarter. Based on current market terms and conditions, we are taking a cautious stance and are focused on credits with positive free cash flow, limited cyclicality, and strong owners.

Statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\n\n(1) \"Core net investment income\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that core net investment income provides useful information to investors and management because it reflects the Company's financial performance excluding (i) the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, (ii) the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and (iii) excise and other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additional information on core net investment income and a reconciliation of core net investment income to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net investment income, are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto.(2) Includes investments in WHF STRS Ohio Senior Loan Fund LLC (\"STRS JV\"), an unconsolidated joint venture, totaling $107.7 million, at fair value.(3) Based on total capital raised by H.I.G. Capital and affiliates.\n\n**SCHEDULE 1**\n\nAs a supplement to GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided information relating to core net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted to exclude the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and excise or other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). There were no excise or other income taxes related to net realized gains and losses for the quarters ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income to core net investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**June 30, 2024** | **June 30, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Amount** |  **Per Share** | **Amount** |  **Per Share**  \n**Amounts** | **Amounts**  \nNet investment income | $ | 9,292 | $ | 0.400 | $ | 10,592 | $ | 0.456  \nNet impact of costs associated with refinancing of indebtedness | - | - | - | -  \nAccrual for capital gains incentive fee | - | - | - | -  \nNet impact of excise tax expense related to net realized gains and losses | - | - | - | -  \nCore net investment income | $ | 9,292 | $ | 0.400 | $ | 10,592 | $ | 0.456  \n  \n**Contacts**\n\nStuart AronsonWhiteHorse Finance, Inc.212-506-0500 _saronson@higwhitehorse.com _\n\nor\n\nJoyson ThomasWhiteHorse Finance, Inc.305-379-2322 _jthomas@higwhitehorse.com _\n\nor\n\nRobert BrinbergRose & Company212-257-5932 _whitehorse@roseandco.com_\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY78644&sd=2024-08-08) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/whitehorse-finance-inc-announces-second-quarter-2024-earnings-results-and-declares-quarterly-distribution-of-0-385-per-share-302217408.html>\n\nSOURCE WhiteHorse Finance, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://whitehorsefinance.com/investors/press-releases/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://whitehorsefinance.com/faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://whitehorsefinance.com/contact/information-requests/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n1450 Brickell Avenue31st FloorMiami, FL 33131\n\n[(305) 381-6999](tel:305-381-6999) [FAX: (305) 379-2013](phone:305-379-2013)\n\ninvestorrelations@whitehorsefinance.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

We are seeing balanced activity across our portfolio in terms of credit performance and stability after incurring realized losses and one markdown on an equity investment in which we had no cash basis during the quarter. As the broader lending market has become more aggressive, WhiteHorse continues to underwrite at conservative terms. Our pipeline level remains high, with opportunities to invest in credits with compelling risk-return characteristics, due in part to our sourcing model, which allows us to source deals in areas of the market where there is less competition. This has allowed us to continue to be conservative in our deal selection and efficiently redeploy capital as repayment activity increases.\"\n\n**Summary Information as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (unaudited):**\n\n**Three Months Ended** | **Three Months Ended** | **Change**  \n---|---|---  \n**($ in thousands except per share data)** | **March 31, 2024** | **December 31, 2023** | **$** | **%**  \nTotal investment income | $ | 25,475 | $ | 25,633 | (158.0) | (0.6)  \nTotal expenses, including excise tax | 14,660 | 15,029 | (369) | (2.5)  \nNet investment income and core net investment income(1) | 10,815 | 10,604 | 211 | 2.0  \nNet investment income and core net investment income(1) per share | 0.465 | 0.456 | 0.009 | 2.0  \nDistributions per share | 0.385 | 0.385 | - | -  \nNet realized gains (losses) | (5,634) | 340 | (5,974) | NMF  \nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) | 788 | (7,518) | 8,306 | (110.5)  \nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations | 5,969 | 3,426 | 2,543 | 74.2  \n**($ in thousands except per share data)** | **As of March 31, 2024** | **As of December 31, 2023** | **$** | **%**  \nTotal investments, at fair value(2) | $ | 697,869 | $ | 696,168 | 1,701 | 0.2  \nSTRS JV total investments, at fair value | 309,429 | 312,217 | (2,788) | (0.9)  \nNet asset value per share | 13.50 | 13.63 | (0.13) | (1.0)  \n  \n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, the fair value of WhiteHorse Finance's investment portfolio was $697.9 million, compared with $696.2 million as of December 31, 2023.

Statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\n\n(1) \"Core net investment income\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that core net investment income provides useful information to investors and management because it reflects the Company's financial performance excluding (i) the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, (ii) the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and (iii) excise and other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additional information on core net investment income and a reconciliation of core net investment income to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net investment income, are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto.(2) Includes investments in WHF STRS Ohio Senior Loan Fund LLC (\"STRS JV\"), an unconsolidated joint venture, totaling $107.0 million, at fair value.(3) Based on total capital raised by H.I.G. Capital and affiliates.\n\n**SCHEDULE 1**\n\nAs a supplement to GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided information relating to core net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted to exclude the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and excise or other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). There were no excise or other income taxes related to net realized gains and losses for the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net investment income to core net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 (in thousands, except per share data):\n\n**March 31, 2024** | **March 31, 2023**  \n---|---  \n**Amount** |  **Per Share** | **Amount** |  **Per Share**  \n**Amounts** | **Amounts**  \nNet investment income | $ | 10,815 | $ | 0.465 | $ | 10,704 | $ | 0.461  \nNet impact of costs associated with refinancing of indebtedness | - | - | - | -  \nAccrual for capital gains incentive fee | - | - | - | -  \nNet impact of excise tax expense related to net realized gains and losses | - | - | - | -  \nCore net investment income | $ | 10,815 | $ | 0.465 | $ | 10,704 | $ | 0.461  \n  \n**Contacts**\n\nStuart AronsonWhiteHorse Finance, Inc.212-506-0500 _saronson@higwhitehorse.com_\n\nor\n\nJoyson ThomasWhiteHorse Finance, Inc.305-379-2322 _jthomas@higwhitehorse.com_\n\nor\n\nRobert BrinbergRose & Company212-257-5932 _whitehorse@roseandco.com_\n\n![Cision](https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY08552&sd=2024-05-08) View original content:<https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/whitehorse-finance-inc-announces-first-quarter-2024-earnings-results-and-declares-quarterly-distribution-of-0-385-per-share-302139118.html>\n\nSOURCE WhiteHorse Finance, Inc.\n\n[View All News](https://whitehorsefinance.com/investors/press-releases/default.aspx)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://whitehorsefinance.com/faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://whitehorsefinance.com/contact/information-requests/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### IR Contact\n\n1450 Brickell Avenue31st FloorMiami, FL 33131\n\n[(305) 381-6999](tel:305-381-6999) [FAX: (305) 379-2013](phone:305-379-2013)\n\ninvestorrelations@whitehorsefinance.com\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

In addition, the Company's board of directors has declared a distribution of $0.385 per share with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The distributions will be payable on April 2, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 22, 2024.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2023 Summary Highlights**\n\n  * Net Asset Value of $316.8 million, or $13.63 per share, compared to $14.30 per share in 2022\n  * Investment portfolio(1) totaling $696.2 million\n  * STRS JV investment portfolio totaling $312.2 million\n  * Gross investment deployments(2) of $56.9 million for the fourth quarter, including new originations of $54.1 million and $2.8 million of fundings for add-ons to existing investments\n  * Gross investment deployments(2) of $135.5 million for the year, including new originations of $100.6 million and $34.9 million of fundings for add-ons to existing investments\n  * Net investment income and core net investment income(3) of $10.6 million, or $0.456 per share, for the fourth quarter\n  * Annual net investment income and core net investment income(3) of $42.7 million, or $1.838 per share\n  * Annual distributions of $1.55 per share, including a special distribution of $0.07 per share\n\n\n\nStuart Aronson, WhiteHorse Finance's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"I am pleased to report that WhiteHorse's core net investment income increased by nearly 15% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022 and was well in excess of our regular dividend. While we marked down certain assets during the period, the investments in our existing portfolio were underwritten at modest leverage levels and are generally well-positioned to service our debt in a sustained high-interest rate environment. Additionally, our portfolio remains overwhelmingly represented by non-cyclical or lightly cyclical borrowers. While we remain cautious about prevailing economic conditions, we are seeing a continuing rebound in terms of both deal volume and quality in the lower middle markets, and our pipeline activity levels remain high with opportunities to invest in credits with compelling risk-return characteristics. The strength of the pipeline enables us to be conservative in our deal selection as repayment activity gains momentum into early 2024.\"\n\n**Portfolio and Investment Activity**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of WhiteHorse Finance's investment portfolio was $696.2 million, compared with $760.2 million as of December 31, 2022. The portfolio as of December 31, 2023 consisted of 116 positions across 72 companies with a weighted average effective yield of 13.7% on income-producing debt investments. The average debt investment size (excluding investments in STRS JV (as defined below)) was $6.7 million with the overall portfolio comprised of approximately 79.9% first lien secured loans, 2.3% second lien secured loans, 2.4% equity and 15.4% in investments in STRS JV. Almost all loans were variable rate investments (primarily indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate) with fixed rate securities representing only 0.9% of loans at fair value. Nearly all performing floating rate investments have interest rate floors.\n\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2023, WhiteHorse Finance made investments in eight new portfolio companies for a total of $54.1 million, added a total of $2.8 million to existing portfolio companies. Proceeds from sales and repayments totaled approximately $34.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, driven by two full realizations in JZ Capital Partners Ltd. and Aeyon LLC, two partial paydowns in JVMC Holdings Corp. (fka RJO Holdings Corp) and Power Service Group CR Acquisition Inc. (d/b/a Power Plant Services) and received net repayments of $0.6 million from revolver loans.\n\nIn addition to the transactions discussed above, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, WhiteHorse Finance transferred assets comprised of four new portfolio companies and one add-on investment, totaling $27.6 million to STRS JV in exchange for cash proceeds.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, WhiteHorse Finance invested $100.6 million across 16 new portfolio companies. The Company also invested $34.9 million in existing portfolio companies. Proceeds from sales and repayments totaled approximately $114.8 million for the year.\n\nIn addition to the transactions above, during the year ended December 31, 2023, WhiteHorse Finance transferred assets totaling $74.9 million in exchange for a net investment in STRS JV of $5.5 million as well as cash proceeds of $69.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company's investment in STRS JV was approximately $107.2 million, at fair value.\n\n**WHF STRS Ohio Senior Loan Fund LLC**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, STRS JV's portfolio totaled $312.2 million, consisted of 34 portfolio companies and had a weighted average effective yield of 12.4% on its portfolio.\n\n**Results of Operations**\n\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's net investment income was approximately $10.6 million and $42.7 million, compared with approximately $11.1 million and $37.3 million for the same periods in the prior year, representing a decrease of approximately 4.5% and an increase of 14.5%, respectively. The increase in net investment income for the year-over-year period was primarily attributable to higher investment income from interest income and the STRS JV due to an increase in base rates. This was partially offset by an increase in interest expense, due to higher base rates, higher incentive fees from higher pre-incentive fee net investment income, partially offset by lower management fees due to lower average assets as compared to the same period in the prior year. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's investment in STRS JV generated an annualized, gross investment yield of approximately 15.4%.\n\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, core net investment income(3) was $10.6 million and $42.7 million, or $0.456 per share and $1.838 per share, respectively, compared with $11.1 million and $35.5 million, or $0.476 per share and $1.526 per share, respectively, for the same periods in the prior year.\n\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, WhiteHorse Finance reported a net realized and unrealized loss on investments and foreign currency transactions of $7.2 million and $22.3 million, respectively. This compares with the three months and year ended December 31, 2022 net realized and unrealized loss on investments and foreign currency transactions of $12.3 million and $21.6 million, respectively. The decrease for the year-over-year period was primarily attributable to markdowns on American Crafts, LC and Arcstor Midco, LLC (d/b/a Arcserve (USA), LLC).\n\nWhiteHorse Finance reported a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $3.4 million and $20.4 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively which compares with a net decrease of $1.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nWhiteHorse Finance's net asset value was $316.8 million, or $13.63 per share, as of December 31, 2023, compared with $322.3 million, or $13.87 per share, as of September 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, WhiteHorse Finance's net asset value was $332.4 million, or $14.30 per share.\n\n**Liquidity and Capital Resources**\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, WhiteHorse Finance had cash and cash equivalents of $24.5 million, compared with $29.8 million as of September 30, 2023, inclusive of restricted cash. As of December 31, 2023, the Company also had $138.5 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facility. \n\n**Distributions**\n\nThe Company's Board of Directors has declared a distribution of $0.385 per share with respect to the quarter ending March 31, 2024. The distributions will be payable on April 2, 2024 to stockholders of record as of March 22, 2024.\n\nOn November 9, 2023, the Company declared a distribution of $0.385 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, consistent with distributions declared for the forty-fifth consecutive quarter since the Company's initial public offering.

Statements other than statements of historical facts included in this press release may constitute forward-looking statements and are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\n\n(1) Includes investments in WHF STRS Ohio Senior Loan Fund LLC (\"STRS JV\"), an unconsolidated joint venture, totaling $107.2 million, at fair value.(2) Excludes investments made in STRS JV.(3) \"Core net investment income\" is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that core net investment income provides useful information to investors and management because it reflects the Company's financial performance excluding (i) the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, (ii) the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and (iii) excise and other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additional information on core net investment income and a reconciliation of core net investment income to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net investment income, are set forth in Schedule 1 hereto.(4) Based on total capital raised by H.I.G. Capital and affiliates.\n\n**SCHEDULE 1**\n\nAs a supplement to GAAP financial measures, the Company has provided information relating to core net investment income, which is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is provided in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net investment income determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company's non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures by other companies, even if similar terms are used to identify such measures. Core net investment income represents net investment income adjusted to exclude the net impact of costs associated with the refinancing of the Company's indebtedness, the accrual of the capital gains incentive fee attributable to net realized and unrealized gains and losses, and excise or other income taxes related to such net realized gains and losses (net of incentive fees). There were no excise or other income taxes related to net realized gains and losses for the quarters and years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe following table provides a
