Accordingly, numerical figures shown as totals in some\ntables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that preceded them.\n● Our functional currency is Renminbi, or RMB. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. We use U.S. dollars as the\nreporting currency in our consolidated financial statements and in this annual report. Assets and liabilities denominated in Renminbi are translated\ninto U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange as of the balance sheet date, equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates, and revenues and\nexpenses are translated using the average rate of exchange in effect during the reporting period.

Known and unknown\nrisks, uncertainties and other factors, including those listed under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors”, may cause our actual results, performance\nor achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.\nYou can identify some of these forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “aim,” “estimate,” “intend,”\n“plan,” “believe,” “is/are likely to,” “potential,” “continue” or other similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our\ncurrent expectations and projections about future events that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy and\nfinancial needs. Factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the\nforward-looking statements, include, but are not limited to, the factors summarized below:\n● We depend upon Blue Hat Fujian to conduct our business in China and control Blue Hat Fujian through contractual arrangements (the\n“Contractual Arrangements”), which may not be as effective as direct ownership;\n● We face risks related to health epidemics, severe weather conditions and other outbreaks, in particular, the current escalating coronavirus\npandemic.\n● We operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of many of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively\nthan we can, preventing us from achieving profitability;\n● Issues with products may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or\nregulatory actions by governmental authorities that could divert resources, affect business operations, decrease sales, increase costs, and put us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition;\n● As a developer and seller of consumer products, we are subject to various government regulations and may be subject to additional regulations in\nthe future, violation of which could subject us to sanctions or otherwise harm our business;\n● If we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, and protect against third party claims that we are\ninfringing on their intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adversely affected; and\n● Uncertainties with respect to China’s legal system could adversely affect us.\nYou should read this annual report and the documents that we refer to in this annual report and have filed as exhibits to this annual report completely and\nwith the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. Other sections of this annual report discuss factors\nwhich could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors emerge from\ntime to time and it is not possible for our management to predict all risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to\nwhich any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We\nqualify all of our forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\nYou should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The forward-looking statements made in this annual report relate only\nto events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this annual report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to\nupdate or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the\nstatements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\niii\nPART I\nITEM 1.

Selected Financial Data\nThe following table presents the selected consolidated financial information for our business. You should read the following information in conjunction\nwith Item 5 “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” below. The following data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and as of\nDecember 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for those years, which were prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, and should be read in conjunction with those statements,\nwhich are included in this annual report beginning on page F-1.\nSelected Consolidated Balance Sheet Data:\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2019 2018 2017\nTotal current assets $ 42,717,316 $ 25,659,179 $ 29,243,641\nTotal assets 58,815,689 35,470,864 33,582,177\nTotal current liabilities 13,680,028 7,122,833 11,594,387\nTotal liabilities 14,065,407 7,214,819 11,771,414\nTotal shareholders’ equity 44,750,282 28,256,045 21,810,763\nTotal liabilities and shareholders’ equity $ 58,815,689 $ 35,470,864 $ 33,582,177\nSelected Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2019 2018 2017\nREVENUES $ 23,834,129 $ 18,531,178 $ 14,144,894\nCOST OF REVENUES (7,531,800) (6,108,676) (5,300,087)\nGROSS PROFIT 16,302,329 12,422,502 8,844,807\nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nSelling (928,680) (759,647) (629,424)\nGeneral and administrative (4,860,189) (3,058,548) (1,915,195)\nResearch and development (1,031,204) (286,842) (355,730)\nTotal operating expenses (6,820,073) (4,105,037) (2,900,349)\nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS 9,482,256 8,317,465 5,944,458\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)\nInterest income 629 219,001 161,382\nInterest expense (171,938) (142,641) (183,291)\nOther finance expenses (4,415) (3,656) (3,473)\nOther (expense) income, net 221,146 134,667 161,091\nTotal other income, net 45,422 207,371 135,709\nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES 9,527,678 8,524,836 6,080,167\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES (453,724) (605,428) 955,194\nNET INCOME 9,073,954 7,919,408 5 ,124,973\nOTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nForeign currency translation adjustment (521,738) (1,474,126) 958,667\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME $ 8,552,216 $ 6,445,282 $ 6,083,640\nBasic and diluted 35,141,114 33,000,000 33,000,000\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic and diluted $ 0.26 $ 0.24 $ 0.16\n1\nSelected Consolidated Cash Flow Data:\nFor the Years Ended December 31,\n2019 2018 2017\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ 12,309,246 $ (414,604) $ 6,989,680\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities (19,111,780) 10,801,986 (15,814,920)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities 10,596,581 (426,221) 10,167,330\nEFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE ON CASH (144,969) (501,935) 72,267\nNET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 3,649,078 9,459,226 1,414,357\nCash paid for income tax 119,243 1,713,763 -\nCash paid for interest 171,938 142,641 183,291\nCash and cash equivalents 10,478,587 11,829,509 2,370,283\nRestricted cash 5,000,000 - -\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 15,478,587 $ 11,829,509 $ 2,370,283\nB. Capitalization and Indebtedness\nNot applicable.\nC. Reasons for the Offer and Use of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nD. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAn investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about these risks, together\nwith the other information appearing elsewhere in this annual report, before deciding to invest in our ordinary shares. The occurrence of any of the\nfollowing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. In these\ncircumstances, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have a limited operating history. There is no assurance that our future operations will result in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate\nsufficient revenues to operate profitably, we may suspend or cease operations.\nGiven our limited operating history, there can be no assurance that we can build our business such that we can earn a significant profit or any profit at\nall. The future of our business will depend upon our ability to obtain and retain customers and when needed, obtain sufficient financing and support from\ncreditors, while we strive to achieve and maintain profitable operations. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses,\ndifficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we undertake. There is no history upon which to base any\nassumption that our business will prove to be successful, and there is significant risk that we will not be able to generate the sales volumes and revenues\nnecessary to achieve profitable operations. To the extent that we cannot achieve our plans and generate revenues which exceed expenses on a consistent\nbasis, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nOur management team has limited public company experience. Prior to our initial public offering, we had never operated as a public company in the\nUnited States and several of our senior management positions are currently held by employees who have been with us for a short period of time. Our entire\nmanagement team, as well as other company personnel, will need to devote substantial time to compliance, and may not effectively or efficiently manage\nour transition into a public company. If we are unable to effectively comply with the regulations applicable to public companies or if we are unable to\nproduce accurate and timely financial statements, which may result in material misstatements in our financial statements or possible restatement of\nfinancial results, our stock price may be materially adversely affected, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of\nNasdaq. Any such failures could also result in litigation or regulatory actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, loss of investor confidence,\ndelisting of our securities, harm to our reputation and diversion of financial and management resources from the operation of our business, any of which\ncould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Additionally, the failure of a key employee\nto perform in his or her current position could result in our inability to continue to grow our business or to implement our business strategy.\n2\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of many of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than\nwe can, preventing us from achieving profitability.\nThe market for animated toys is highly competitive, particular in China, where our operations are located. Competition may result in pricing pressures,\nreduced profit margins or lost market share, or a failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm its business and results of\noperations. We compete directly against manufacturers of games and toys, including large, diversified entertainment companies with substantial market\nshare. In addition, we compete with other companies who are focused on building their brands across multiple product and consumer categories. Across our\nbusiness, we face competitors who are constantly monitoring and attempting to anticipate consumer tastes and trends, seeking ideas which will appeal to\nconsumers and introducing new products that compete with our products for consumer acceptance and purchase. Many of our competitors have significant\ncompetitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, less-costly production, more established relationships with\na broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we\ndo.\nIn addition to existing competitors, the barriers to entry for new participants in the entertainment industry and in the consumer products industry are\nlow, and the increasing importance of digital media, and the heightened connection between digital media and consumer interest, has further increased the\nability for new participants to enter our markets, and has broadened the array of companies we may compete with. New participants with a popular product\nidea or entertainment property can gain access to consumers and become a significant source of competition for our products in a very short period of time.\nThese existing and new competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than us to changes in consumer preferences. Our competitors’ products may\nachieve greater market acceptance than our products and potentially reduce demand for our products, lower our revenues and lower our profitability.\nOur business depends significantly on our ability to maintain an efficient distribution network for our products. Failure by us to maintain such\ndistribution network could adversely affect our financial condition, competitiveness and growth prospects.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain efficient distribution methods for our products. We primarily sell our products in China through local\nChina-based distributors. . In 2019, we primarily relied on five Chinese distributors for the sale of our products, which accounted for 34.9% of our total\nrevenue In 2019, 100% of our products were sold in China and, of these sales in China, approximately 98.4% were generated from Chinese distributors.\nThe impact of economic conditions on any of our distributors, such as bankruptcy, could result in sales channel disruption. In the event our distributors\nfail to sell our products in sufficient amounts, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our revenue. We intend to expand our distribution\nnetwork; however, we cannot make any assurances that we will be successful in doing so or if such relationships will be on favorable terms. Moreover, the\nfunctioning of our products distribution could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control, including: extremes of weather or longer-term\nclimatic changes; accidental damage; disruption to the supply of material or services; product quality and safety issues; systems failure; workforce actions;\nor environmental contamination. Such disruption or failures may materially adversely affect our ability to sell products and therefore materially adversely\naffect our financial condition, competitiveness and growth prospects.\nOur business depends in large part on the success of our vendors and outsourcers, and our brand and reputation may be harmed by actions taken\nby third parties that are outside of our control. In addition, any material failure, inadequacy, or interruption resulting from such vendors or\noutsourcings could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe rely on vendor and outsourcing relationships with third parties for services and systems including manufacturing, transportation and logistics. Any\nshortcoming of a vendor or outsourcer, particularly an issue affecting the quality of these services or systems, may be attributed by customers to us, thus\ndamaging our reputation and brand value, and potentially affecting our results of operations. In addition, problems with transitioning these services and\nsystems to or operating failures with these vendors and outsourcers could cause delays in product sales, and reduce efficiency of our operations, and\nsignificant capital investments could be required to remediate the problem.\n3\nIssues with products may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals, replacements of products, or\nregulatory actions by governmental authorities that could divert resources, affect business operations, decrease sales, increase costs, and put us at a\ncompetitive disadvantage, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may experience issues with products that may lead to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims, recalls, withdrawals,\nreplacements of products, or regulatory actions by governmental authorities. Any of these activities could result in increased governmental scrutiny, harm\nto our reputation, reduced demand by consumers for products, decreased willingness by retailer customers to purchase or provide marketing support for\nthose products, adverse impacts on our ability to enter into licensing agreements for products on competitive terms, absence or increased cost of insurance,\nor additional safety and testing requirements. Such results could divert development and management resources, adversely affect our business operations,\ndecrease sales, increase legal fees and other costs, and put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other companies not affected by similar issues with\nproducts, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is seasonal and therefore our annual operating results will depend, in large part, on our sales during the relatively brief holiday\nshopping season.\nSales of our toys are seasonal, with a majority of sales occurring during the period from August through December in anticipation of the holiday\nseason. This seasonality in our industry has increased over time, as retailers become more efficient in their control of inventory levels through quick\nresponse inventory management techniques. The majority of retail sales of toys generally occur in the fourth quarter, close to the holiday season.\nIf we or our customers determine that one of our products is more popular at retail than was originally anticipated, there may not be sufficient time to\nproduce enough additional products to fully meet consumer demand. Additionally, the logistics of supplying more and more product within shorter time\nperiods increases the risk that we, or our third party providers, will fail to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules, which also may reduce our\nsales and harm our financial performance. This seasonal pattern requires accurate forecasting of demand for products during the holiday season in order to\navoid losing potential sales of popular products or producing excess inventory of products that are less popular with consumers. Our failure to accurately\npredict and respond to consumer demand, resulting in our under producing popular items and/or overproducing less popular items, would reduce our total\nsales and harm our results of operations. In addition, as a result of the seasonal nature of our business, we would be significantly and adversely affected, in\na manner disproportionate to the impact on a company with sales spread more evenly throughout the year, by unforeseen events such as a terrorist attack or\neconomic shock that harm the retail environment or consumer buying patterns during our key selling season, or by events such as strikes or port delays that\ninterfere with the shipment of goods during the critical months leading up to the holiday shopping season.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team listed in the section entitled “Directors, Senior Management and Employees”\nlocated elsewhere in this annual report, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Recruiting and retaining other\nqualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. Competition for skilled personnel is\nintense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous\ncompanies for individuals with similar skill sets. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive or key employee could adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nWe will need to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 100 employees, all of which were full-time employees. As our company matures, we expect to expand our employee\nbase to increase our sales and marketing department. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the\nneed to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert a\ndisproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational\nmistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant\ncapital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. If our\nmanagement is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and grow revenue could be\nreduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product\ncandidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\n4\nFailure of beneficial owners of our shares who are PRC residents to comply with certain PRC foreign exchange regulations could restrict our\nability to distribute profits, restrict our overseas and cross-border investment activities and subject us to liability under PRC law.\nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, has promulgated regulations, including the Notice on Relevant Issues Relating to Foreign\nExchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Investment and Financing and Round-Trip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or Circular 37, and its\nappendices. These regulations require PRC residents, including PRC institutions and individuals, to register with local branches of SAFE in connection\nwith their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents’\nlegally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in Circular 37 as a “special purpose vehicle”, or\nSPV. The term “control” under Circular 37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by the PRC\nresidents in the offshore SPVs by such means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. Circular 37\nfurther requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the SPV, such as increase or decrease of capital\ncontributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests\nin a SPV fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore\nparent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the SPV may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional\ncapital into its PRC subsidiaries. Further, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under\nPRC law for foreign exchange evasion.\nThese regulations apply to our direct and indirect shareholders who are PRC residents and may apply to any offshore acquisitions or share transfers\nthat we make in the future if our shares are issued to PRC residents. However, in practice, different local SAFE branches may have different views and\nprocedures on the application and implementation of SAFE regulations, and there remains uncertainty with respect to its implementation. We cannot assure\nyou that these direct or indirect shareholders of our company who are PRC residents will be able to successfully update the registration of their direct and\nindirect equity interest as required in the future. If they fail to update the registration, our PRC subsidiary could be subject to fines and legal penalties, and\nSAFE could restrict our cross-border investment activities and our foreign exchange activities, including restricting our PRC subsidiary’s ability to\ndistribute dividends to, or obtain loans denominated in foreign currencies from, our company, or prevent us from contributing additional capital into our\nPRC subsidiary. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefits plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.\nCompanies operating in China are required to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain social insurance,\nhousing funds and other welfare-oriented payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including\nbonuses and allowances, of employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where they operate their\nbusinesses. The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different levels\nof economic development in different locations. If we fail to make contributions to various employee benefit plans and to comply with applicable PRC\nlabor-related laws in the future, we may be subject to late payment penalties. We may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to\npay late fees and fines. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid employee benefits, our financial condition and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Corporate Structure\nWe depend upon the Contractual Arrangements in conducting our business in China, which may not be as effective as direct ownership.\nOur affiliation with Blue Hat Fujian is managed through contractual arrangements, or the Contractual Arrangements, which agreements may not be as\neffective in providing us with control over Blue Hat Fujian as direct ownership. The Contractual Arrangements are governed by and would be interpreted in\naccordance with the laws of the People’s Republic of China, or the PRC. If Blue Hat Fujian fails to perform the obligations under the Contractual\nArrangements, we may have to rely on legal remedies under the laws of the PRC, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming\ndamages. There is a risk that we may be unable to obtain any of these remedies. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other\njurisdictions. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the Contractual Arrangements, or could affect the validity\nof the Contractual Arrangements.\nWe may not be able to consolidate the financial results of some of our affiliated companies or such consolidation could materially adversely affect\nour operating results and financial condition.\nAll of our business is conducted through Blue Hat Fujian, which is considered a VIE for accounting purposes, and we, through Blue Hat WFOE, are\nconsidered the primary beneficiary, thus enabling us to consolidate our financial results in our consolidated financial statements. In the event that in the\nfuture a company we hold as a VIE no longer meets the definition of a VIE under applicable accounting rules, or we are deemed not to be the primary\nbeneficiary, we would not be able to consolidate line by line that entity’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes.\nAlso, if in the future an affiliate company becomes a VIE and we become the primary beneficiary, we would be required to consolidate that entity’s\nfinancial results in our consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes. If such entity’s financial results were negative, this would have a\ncorresponding negative impact on our operating results for reporting purposes.\n5\nBecause we rely on the Contractual Arrangements for our revenue, the termination of these agreements would severely and detrimentally affect\nour continuing business viability under our current corporate structure.\nWe are a holding company and all of our business operations are conducted through the Contractual Arrangements. Blue Hat Fujian may terminate the\nContractual Arrangements for any or no reason at all. Because neither we, nor our subsidiaries, own equity interests of Blue Hat Fujian, the termination of\nthe Contractual Arrangements would sever our ability to receive payments from Blue Hat Fujian under our current holding company structure. While we\nare currently not aware of any event or reason that may cause the Contractual Arrangements to terminate, we cannot assure you that such an event or reason\nwill not occur in the future. In the event that the Contractual Arrangements are terminated, this would have a severe and detrimental effect on our\ncontinuing business viability under our current corporate structure, which, in turn, may affect the value of your investment.\nContractual arrangements in relation to our VIE may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that we or our VIE\nowe additional taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.\nUnder applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax\nauthorities within ten years after the taxable year when the transactions are conducted. We could face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax\nauthorities determine that the VIE contractual arrangements were not entered into on an arm’s-length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible\nreduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust the income of our VIE in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A\ntransfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by our VIE for PRC tax purposes, which could\nin turn increase its tax liabilities without reducing our subsidiary’s tax expenses. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and\nother penalties on our VIE for the adjusted but unpaid taxes according to the applicable regulations. Our financial position could be materially and\nadversely affected if our VIE’s tax liabilities increase or if it is required to pay late payment fees and other penalties.\nWe conduct our business through Blue Hat Fujian by means of Contractual Arrangements. If the PRC courts or administrative authorities\ndetermine that these contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties and our business\ncould be adversely affected. In addition, changes in such PRC laws and regulations may materially and adversely affect our business.\nThere are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of PRC laws, rules and regulations, including the laws, rules and regulations\ngoverning the validity and enforcement of the contractual arrangements between Blue Hat WFOE and Blue Hat Fujian. We have been advised by our PRC\ncounsel, Beijing Dentons Law Offices, LLP, or Dentons, based on their understanding of the current PRC laws, rules and regulations, that (i) the structure\nfor operating our business in China (including our corporate structure and contractual arrangements with Blue Hat Fujian, Blue Hat Fujian and their\nshareholders) will not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (ii) the contractual arrangements among Blue Hat WFOE\nand Blue Hat Fujian and their shareholders governed by PRC law are valid, binding and enforceable, and will not result in any violation of PRC laws or\nregulations currently in effect. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and\nregulations concerning foreign investment in the PRC, and their application to and effect on the legality, binding effect and enforceability of the contractual\narrangements. In particular, we cannot rule out the possibility that PRC regulatory authorities, courts or arbitral tribunals may in the future adopt a different\nor contrary interpretation or take a view that is inconsistent with the opinion of our PRC legal counsel.\nIf any of our PRC entities or their ownership structure or the Contractual Arrangements are determined to be in violation of any existing or future PRC\nlaws, rules or regulations, or any of our PRC entities fail to obtain or maintain any of the required governmental permits or approvals, the relevant PRC\nregulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n● revoking the business and operating licenses;\n● discontinuing or restricting the operations;\n● imposing conditions or requirements with which the PRC entities may not be able to comply;\n● requiring us and our PRC entities to restructure the relevant ownership structure or operations;\n● restricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from our initial public offering to finance our business and operations in China; or\n● imposing fines.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties would severely disrupt our ability to conduct business and have a material adverse effect on our financial\ncondition, results of operations and prospects.\n6\nThe shareholders of our VIE may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and\nfinancial condition.\nThe shareholders of our VIE may have actual or potential conflicts of interest with us. These shareholders may refuse to sign or breach, or cause our\nVIE to breach, or refuse to renew, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and our VIE, which would have a material and adverse effect\non our ability to effectively control our VIE and receive economic benefits from it. For example, the shareholders may be able to cause our agreements\nwith our VIE to be performed in a manner adverse to us by, among other things, failing to remit payments due under the contractual arrangements to us on\na timely basis. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise any or all of these shareholders will act in the best interests of our company or\nsuch conflicts will be resolved in our favor. Currently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these\nshareholders and our company. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and these shareholders, we would have to rely on legal\nproceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nOur current corporate structure and business operations may be affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law.\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress, or the NPC, approved the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. Since it\nis relatively new, uncertainties exist in relation to its interpretation and its implementation rules that are yet to be issued. The Foreign Investment Law does\nnot explicitly classify whether variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign-invested\nenterprises if they are ultimately “controlled” by foreign investors. However, it has a catch-all provision under definition of “foreign investment” that\nincludes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council.\nTherefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a\nform of foreign investment. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our control over our VIE through contractual arrangements will not be deemed as\nforeign investment in the future.\nThe Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested entities that operate in industries\nspecified as either “restricted” or “prohibited” from foreign investment in a “negative list” that is yet to be published. It is unclear whether the “negative\nlist” to be published will differ from the current Special Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List). The Foreign\nInvestment Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in “restricted” or “prohibited” industries will require market entry clearance and other\napprovals from relevant PRC government authorities. If our control over our VIE through contractual arrangements are deemed as foreign investment in the\nfuture, and any business of our VIE is “restricted” or “prohibited” from foreign investment under the “negative list” effective at the time, we may be\ndeemed to be in violation of the Foreign Investment Law, the contractual arrangements that allow us to have control over our VIE may be deemed as\ninvalid and illegal, and we may be required to unwind such contractual arrangements and/or restructure our business operations, any of which may have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business operations.\nFurthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing\ncontractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take\ntimely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current\ncorporate structure and business operations.\nIf any of our affiliated entities becomes the subject of a bankruptcy or liquidation proceeding, we may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held\nby such entity, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct our operations in China through our Contractual Arrangements. As part of these arrangements, substantially all of our assets that\nare significant to the operation of our business are held by our affiliated entities. If any of these entities becomes bankrupt and all or part of their assets\nbecome subject to liens or rights of third party creditors, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities, which could materially and\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if any of our affiliated entities undergoes a voluntary or involuntary\nliquidation proceeding, its equity owner or unrelated third party creditors may claim rights relating to some or all of these assets, which would hinder our\nability to operate our business and could materially and adversely affect our business, our ability to generate revenue and the market price of our ordinary\nshares.\n7\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, severe weather conditions and other outbreaks, in particular, the current escalating coronavirus\npandemic.\nIn recent years, there have been outbreaks of epidemics in various countries, including China. Recently, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) in China, which has spread rapidly to many parts of the world. The outbreak has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, and\nthe temporary closure of stores and facilities throughout China and other parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared\nCOVID-19 a pandemic.\nSubstantially all of our revenues and our workforce are concentrated in China. Consequently, our results of operations will likely be adversely, and\nmay be materially, affected, to the extent that the COVID-19 or any other epidemic harms the Chinese and global economy in general. Any potential impact\nto our results will depend on, to a large extent, future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the\nCOVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by government authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, almost all of\nwhich are beyond our control. Potential impacts include, but are not limited to, the following:\n● temporary closure of offices, travel restrictions or suspension of services of our customers and suppliers have negatively affected, and could\ncontinue to negatively affect, the demand for our services;\n● our customers may require additional time to pay us or fail to pay us at all, which could significantly increase the amount of accounts receivable\nand require us to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts;\n● the business operations of our distributors have been and could continue to be negatively impacted by the outbreak, which may negatively impact\nour distribution channel, or result in loss of customers or disruption of our services, which may in turn materially adversely affect our financial\ncondition and operating results; and\n● any disruption of our supply chain, logistics providers or customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nBecause of the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak, the financial impact related to the outbreak cannot be reasonably estimated at this\ntime, but our consolidated results for the first quarter of 2020 and full year 2020 may be adversely affected. We expect our total revenues in the first quarter\nof 2020 to decrease, and there is no guarantee that our total revenues will grow or remain at a similar level in the next three quarters of 2020. We may have\nto record downward adjustments or impairment in the fair value of investments in the first quarter of 2020, if conditions have not been significantly\nimproved and global stock markets have not recovered from recent declines.\nIn general, our business could be adversely affected by the effects of epidemics, including, but not limited to, COVID-19, avian influenza, severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome (SARS), the influenza A virus, Ebola virus, severe weather conditions such as a snowstorm, flood or hazardous air pollution, or other\noutbreaks. In response to an epidemic, severe weather conditions, or other outbreaks, government and other organizations may adopt regulations and\npolicies that could lead to severe disruption to our daily operations, including temporary closure of our offices and other facilities. These severe conditions\nmay cause us and/or our partners to make internal adjustments, including but not limited to, temporarily closing down business, limiting business hours,\nand setting restrictions on travel and/or visits with clients and partners for a prolonged period of time. Various impacts arising from severe conditions may\ncause business disruption, resulting in material, adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations.\n8\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, and protect against third party claims that we are\ninfringing on their intellectual property rights, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe value of our business depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and information, including our trademarks, copyrights, patents,\ntrade secrets, and rights under agreements with third parties, in China and around the world, as well as our customer, employee, and consumer data. Third\nparties may try to challenge our ownership of our intellectual property in China and around the world. In addition, our business is subject to the risk of third\nparties counterfeiting our products or infringing on our intellectual property rights. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our\nintellectual property. We may need to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of\nresources. If we fail to protect our proprietary intellectual property and information, including with respect to any successful challenge to our ownership of\nintellectual property or material infringements of our intellectual property, this failure could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of\nothers, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our success in obtaining and maintaining issued patents, trademarks and other intellectual property\nrights in China and elsewhere and protecting our proprietary technology. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary\ntechnology, competitors may be able to use our technologies or the goodwill we have acquired in the marketplace and erode or negate any competitive\nadvantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that any of our patents have, or that any of our pending patent applications that mature into issued patents will\ninclude, claims with a scope sufficient to protect our products, any additional features we develop for our products or any new products. Other parties may\nhave developed technologies that may be related or competitive to our system, may have filed or may file patent applications and may have received or\nmay receive patents that overlap or conflict with our patent applications, either by claiming the same methods or devices or by claiming subject matter that\ncould dominate our patent position. Our patent position may involve complex legal and factual questions, and, therefore, the scope, validity and\nenforceability of any patent claims that we may obtain cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, deemed unenforceable,\ninvalidated or circumvented. Proceedings challenging our patents could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application or loss or\nreduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such proceedings may be costly. Thus, any patents that\nwe may own may not provide any protection against competitors. Furthermore, an adverse decision in an interference proceeding can result in a third party\nreceiving the patent right sought by us, which in turn could affect our ability to commercialize our products.\nThough an issued patent is presumed valid and enforceable, its issuance is not conclusive as to its validity or its enforceability and it may not provide\nus with adequate proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Competitors could purchase our products and\nattempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights,\ndesign around our patents, or develop and obtain patent protection for more effective technologies, designs or methods. We may be unable to prevent the\nunauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or trade secrets by consultants, suppliers, vendors, former employees and current employees.\nOur ability to enforce our patent rights depends on our ability to detect infringement. It may be difficult to detect infringers who do not advertise the\ncomponents that are used in their products. Moreover, it may be difficult or impossible to obtain evidence of infringement in a competitor’s or potential\ncompetitor’s product. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be\ncommercially meaningful.\nIn addition, proceedings to enforce or defend our patents could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nSuch proceedings could also provoke third parties to assert claims against us, including that some or all of the claims in one or more of our patents are\ninvalid or otherwise unenforceable. If any of our patents covering our products are invalidated or found unenforceable, or if a court found that valid,\nenforceable patents held by third parties covered one or more of our products, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur\nsignificant expenses to enforce or defend our rights.\n9\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n● any of our patents, or any of our pending patent applications, if issued, will include claims having a scope sufficient to protect our products;\n● any of our pending patent applications will issue as patents;\n● we will be able to successfully commercialize our products on a substantial scale, if approved, before our relevant patents we may have expire;\n● we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents and pending patent applications;\n● we were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n● others will not develop similar or alternative technologies that do not infringe our patents; any of our patents will be found to ultimately be valid\nand enforceable;\n● any patents issued to us will provide a basis for an exclusive market for our commercially viable products, will provide us with any competitive\nadvantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n● we will develop additional proprietary technologies or products that are separately patentable; or\n● our commercial activities or products will not infringe upon the patents of others.\nWe rely, in part, upon unpatented trade secrets, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our\ncompetitive position. Further, our trade secrets could otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors.\nLitigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money\nand could prevent us from selling our products or affect our stock price.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation\nregarding patent rights occurs in our industry. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources\nand have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and\nobtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. We do not always conduct independent\nreviews of patents issued to third parties. In addition, patent applications in China and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, or\nunintentionally abandoned patents or applications can be revived, so there may be applications of others now pending or recently revived patents of which\nwe are unaware. These applications may later result in issued patents, or the revival of previously abandoned patents, that will prevent, limit or otherwise\ninterfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Third parties may, in the future, assert claims that we are employing their proprietary technology\nwithout authorization, including claims from competitors or from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own\npatent portfolio may have no deterrent effect. As we continue to commercialize our products in their current or updated forms, launch new products and\nenter new markets, we expect competitors may claim that one or more of our products infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business\nstrategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent\napplications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved, and the uncertainty of litigation may increase the risk of business resources and\nmanagement’s attention being diverted to patent litigation. We have, and we may in the future, receive letters or other threats or claims from third parties\ninviting us to take licenses under, or alleging that we infringe, their patents.\nMoreover, we may become party to future adversarial proceedings regarding our patent portfolio or the patents of third parties. Patents may be\nsubjected to opposition, post-grant review or comparable proceedings lodged in various foreign, both national and regional, patent offices. The legal\nthreshold for initiating litigation or contested proceedings may be low, so that even lawsuits or proceedings with a low probability of success might be\ninitiated. Litigation and contested proceedings can also be expensive and time-consuming, and our adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to\ndedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we can. We may also occasionally use these proceedings to challenge the\npatent rights of others. We cannot be certain that any particular challenge will be successful in limiting or eliminating the challenged patent rights of the\nthird party.\n10\nAny lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential\nintellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n● stop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n● lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our\nintellectual property rights against others; incur significant legal expenses;\n● pay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n● pay the attorney’s fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n● redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and infeasible; and\n● attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or from\nthird parties who may attempt to license rights that they do not have.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our\nfinancial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property\nrights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial\nroyalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such\nlicense may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to redesign our products in a way that would\nnot infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods\nor products. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing\nproducts from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position could be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements with our employees,\nconsultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential\nnature of our proprietary information using commonly accepted physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the\ncase of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary\ninformation. Our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor,\nand recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to\ncopy or reverse engineer certain aspects of our products that we consider proprietary. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a\ntrade secret can be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Even though we use commonly accepted security measures,\ntrade secret violations are often a matter of state law, and the criteria for protection of trade secrets can vary among different jurisdictions. In addition, trade\nsecrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information,\nsuch as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor, our business\nand competitive position could be harmed.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. We incorporate licensed technology\nin some of our products. Any infringement claims or lawsuits, even if not meritorious, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, divert\nmanagement’s attention and resources, require us to redesign our products and services, if feasible, require us to pay royalties or enter into licensing\nagreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies, and/or may materially disrupt the conduct of our business.\nIn addition, we may face claims by third parties that our agreements with employees, contractors or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual\nproperty to us are ineffective or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes\nregarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual\nproperty. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual\nproperty or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could harm our business and competitive position.\n11\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade\nsecrets.\nWe may employ individuals who previously worked with other companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to\nensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims\nthat we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property or personal data,\nincluding trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these\nclaims. If we fail in defending any such claims or settling those claims, in addition to paying monetary damages or a settlement payment, we may lose\nvaluable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and\nbe a distraction to management and other employees.\nOur computer systems and operations may be vulnerable to security breaches.\nWe expect that the cloud-based applications embedded in our toys will be an important foundation for establishing our company as a leading source of\ntechnology. For that reason, among others, the safety of our network and our secure transmission of information over the internet will be essential to our\noperations and our services. Our network and our computer infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to physical breaches or to the introduction of computer\nviruses, abuse of use and similar disruptive problems and security breaches that could cause loss (both economic and otherwise), interruptions, delays or\nloss of services to our users. It is possible that advances in computer capabilities or new technologies could result in a compromise or breach of the\ntechnology we use to protect user transaction data. A party that is able to circumvent our security systems could misappropriate proprietary information,\ncause interruptions in our operations or utilize our network without authorization. Security breaches also could damage our reputation and expose us to a\nrisk of loss, litigation and possible liability. We cannot guarantee you that our security measures will prevent security breaches.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China’s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and\noperations.\nSubstantially all of our assets and operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects\nmay be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies\nof most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign\nexchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for\neconomic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a\nsubstantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role\nin regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China’s economic\ngrowth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential\ntreatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various\nsectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the\nChinese government or in the laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such\ndevelopments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive\nposition. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these\nmeasures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations\nmay be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government\nhas implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased\neconomic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating results.\n12\nUncertainties with respect to China’s legal system could adversely affect us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions under the civil law system\nmay be cited for reference but have limited precedential value.\nIn 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters in general. The\noverall effect of legislation over the past three decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China.\nHowever, China has not developed a fully integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of\neconomic activities in China. In particular, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. Since PRC administrative\nand court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory provisions and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate\nthe outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. These uncertainties may affect our judgment on the\nrelevance of legal requirements and our ability to enforce our contractual rights or tort claims. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited\nthrough unmerited or frivolous legal actions or threats in attempts to extract payments or benefits from us.\nFurthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at\nall and may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of any of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation.\nIn addition, any administrative and court proceedings in China may be protracted, resulting in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\nattention.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing actions in China against us or our\nmanagement named in the annual report based on foreign laws.\nWe are a holding company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. We conduct substantially all of our operations in China and\nsubstantially all of our assets are located in China. In addition, all our senior employees reside within China for a significant portion of the time and most\nare PRC residents. As a result, it may be difficult for our shareholders to effect service of process upon us or those persons inside mainland China. In\naddition, China does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the Cayman Islands and many\nother countries and regions. Therefore, recognition and enforcement in China of judgments of a court in any of these non-PRC jurisdictions in relation to\nany matter not subject to a binding arbitration provision may be difficult or impossible.\nWe may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have,\nand any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiary to make payments to us could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our\nbusiness.\nWe are a Cayman Islands holding company and we rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC subsidiary for our\ncash requirements, including for services of any debt we may incur. Our PRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends is based upon its distributable\nearnings. Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiary to pay dividends to its respective shareholders only out of their accumulated profits, if any,\ndetermined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our PRC subsidiary, our VIE and its subsidiaries are\nrequired to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital.\nOur PRC subsidiary as a FIE is also required to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund, although the amount to\nbe set aside, if any, is determined at its discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. If our PRC subsidiary incurs debt on their own\nbehalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Any limitation on the\nability of our PRC subsidiary to distribute dividends or other payments to their respective shareholders could materially and adversely limit our ability to\ngrow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct our business.\nIn addition, the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules provide that a withholding tax rate of up to 10% will be applicable to\ndividends payable by Chinese companies to non-PRC-resident enterprises unless otherwise exempted or reduced according to treaties or arrangements\nbetween the PRC central government and governments of other countries or regions where the non-PRC resident enterprises are incorporated.\n13\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nThe value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in political and\neconomic conditions in China and by China’s foreign exchange policies. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging\nthe value of the Renminbi to the U.S. dollar, and the Renminbi appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between\nJuly 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since\nJune 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. On November 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the regular five-year review of the basket of currencies that make up the Special Drawing Right, or the SDR,\nand decided that with effect from October 1, 2016, Renminbi is determined to be a freely usable currency and will be included in the SDR basket as a fifth\ncurrency, along with the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Renminbi depreciated significantly\nin the backdrop of a surging U.S. dollar and persistent capital outflows of China. With the development of the foreign exchange market and progress\ntowards interest rate liberalization and Renminbi internationalization, the PRC government may in the future announce further changes to the exchange rate\nsystem, and we cannot assure you that the Renminbi will not appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar in the future. It is\ndifficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the\nfuture.\nSignificant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to convert\nU.S. dollars from our initial public offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse\neffect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose\nof making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a\nnegative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to U.S. dollars\nwould affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms regardless of any underlying change in our business or results of operations.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any\nhedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the\nfuture, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited, and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure, or at all. In addition,\nour currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our net revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency\nout of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our Cayman Islands holding company\nprimarily relies on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiary to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign\nexchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange\ntransactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under\nthe existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary in China may be used to pay\ndividends to our company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted\ninto foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we\nneed to obtain SAFE approval to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiary and VIE to pay off their respective debt in a currency other\nthan Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. The PRC\ngovernment may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system\nprevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies\nto our shareholders.\nCertain PRC regulations may make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions.\nAmong other things, the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six\nPRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition\nactivities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. Such regulation requires, among other things, that the MOFCOM be notified in advance\nof any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor acquires control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC\noperations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council in\n2008, are triggered. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law promulgated by the Standing Committee of the NPC which became effective in 2008 requires that\ntransactions which are deemed concentrations and involve parties with specified turnover thresholds must be cleared by the MOFCOM before they can be\ncompleted. In addition, PRC national security review rules which became effective in September 2011 require acquisitions by foreign investors of PRC\ncompanies engaged in military related or certain other industries that are crucial to national security be subject to security review before consummation of\nany such acquisition. We may pursue potential strategic acquisitions that are complementary to our business and operations. Complying with the\nrequirements of these regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining\napproval or clearance from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our\nbusiness or maintain our market share.\n14\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial\nowners or our PRC subsidiary to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary’s ability to\nincrease their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment\nand Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, to replace the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning\nForeign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents’ Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE\nCircular 75, which ceased to be effective upon the promulgation of SAFE Circular 37. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents (including PRC\nindividuals and PRC corporate entities) to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities.\nSAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future.\nUnder SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments in\noffshore SPVs will be required to register such investments with the SAFE or its local branches. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect\nshareholder of a SPV is required to update its filed registration with the local branch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change.\nMoreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of\nSAFE. If any PRC shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration or to update the previously filed registration, the subsidiary of such SPV\nin China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV\nmay also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions into its subsidiary in China. On February 13, 2015, the SAFE promulgated a Notice on\nFurther Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective on June 1,\n2015. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound overseas direct\ninvestments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, will be filed with qualified banks instead of the SAFE. The qualified banks will directly\nexamine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of the SAFE.\nWe cannot assure you that all of our shareholders that may be subject to SAFE regulations have completed all necessary registrations with the local\nSAFE branch or qualified banks as required by SAFE Circular 37, and we cannot assure you that these individuals may continue to make required filings or\nupdates in a timely manner, or at all. We can provide no assurance that we are or will in the future continue to be informed of identities of all PRC residents\nholding direct or indirect interest in our company. Any failure or inability by such individuals to comply with the SAFE regulations may subject us to fines\nor legal sanctions, such as restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our PRC subsidiary’s ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain foreign\nexchange-denominated loans from, our company or prevent us from making distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our\nability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as these foreign exchange regulations are still relatively new and their interpretation and implementation has been constantly evolving, it\nis unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented\nby the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign\nexchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the\ncase may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations.\nThis may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\n15\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Relating to Enterprise Income Tax\non Transfers of Assets between Non-resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, which was partially abolished on December 29, 2017. SAT Bulletin 7 extends\nits tax jurisdiction to transactions involving transfer of taxable assets through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition,\nSAT Bulletin 7 has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT\nBulletin 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-\nresident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which was partially revised. SAT Bulletin 37 came into effect on December 1, 2017. The\nSAT Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as\noffshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our\ncompany is transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under SAT\nBulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. For transfer of shares in our company by investors who are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiary may be\nrequested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with\nSAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to\nestablish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of\noperations.\nOur use of third party manufacturers to produce our products presents risks to our business.\nFor the foreseeable future, all of our products will be manufactured by third party manufacturers, the majority of which are, and we expect will\ncontinue to be, located in China. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our two largest suppliers accounted for 54.84% and 31.53%, respectively, of our\ntotal purchases. If we were prevented or delayed in obtaining products or components for a material portion of our product line due to political, civil, labor\nor other factors beyond our control, including natural disasters or pandemics, our operations may be substantially disrupted, potentially for a significant\nperiod of time. This delay could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability and harm our business while alternative sources of supply are secured.\nAdditionally, the suspension of operations of a third party manufacturer by government inspectors in China could result in delays to us in obtaining\nproducts and may harm sales.\nOur dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOne or a few customers have in the past, and may in the future, represent a substantial portion of our total revenues in any one year or over a period of\nseveral years. For example, in 2019, two customers under the same ownership together accounted for 12.1% of our total revenues. Therefore, the loss of\nbusiness from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, a default or delay in\npayment on a significant scale by a customer could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAdditional factors outside of our control related to doing business in China could negatively affect our business.\nAdditional factors that could negatively affect our business include a potential significant revaluation of the Renminbi, which may result in an increase\nin the cost of producing products in China, labor shortages and increases in labor costs in China as well as difficulties in moving products manufactured in\nChina out of the country, whether due to port congestion, labor disputes, slow downs, product regulations and/or inspections or other factors. Prolonged\ndisputes or slowdowns can negatively impact both the time and cost of transporting goods. Natural disasters or health pandemics impacting China can also\nhave a significant negative impact on our business. Further, the imposition of trade sanctions or other regulations against products imported by us from, or\nthe loss of “normal trade relations” status with, China, could significantly increase our cost of products exported outside of China and harm our business.\nRisks Related to our Ordinary Shares\nAn active trading market for our ordinary shares may not be sustained.\nOur ordinary shares have been listed on Nasdaq only since July 26, 2019, and we cannot assure you that an active trading market for our ordinary\nshares will be sustained or maintained. The lack of an active trading market may impair the value of your shares and your ability to sell your shares at the\ntime you wish to sell them. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our ordinary shares and enter into\nstrategic partnerships or acquire other complementary products, technologies or businesses by using shares of our ordinary shares as consideration. In\naddition, if we fail to satisfy exchange continued listing standards, we could be de-listed, which would have a negative effect on the price of our ordinary\nshares.\nWe expect that the price of our ordinary shares will fluctuate substantially and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price you\npurchased the shares at.\n16\nThe market price of our ordinary shares is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors, including:\n● the volume and timing of sales of our products;\n● the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or others in our industry;\n● disputes or other developments with respect to our or others’ intellectual property rights;\n● our ability to develop, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n● product liability claims or other litigation;\n● quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of others in our industry;\n● media exposure of our products or of those of others in our industry;\n● changes in governmental regulations or in reimbursement;\n● changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\n● general market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our\ncompetitors.\nIn recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate\nto the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our ordinary shares,\nregardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in\nmarket price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation,\ncould result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management’s attention and resources from our\nbusiness.\nOur ordinary shares are considered to be penny stock. Trading in penny stocks has certain restrictions and these restrictions could negatively affect\nthe price and liquidity of our ordinary shares.\nOur ordinary shares trade below $5.00 per share. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security\nthat has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. As a result, our ordinary shares are considered “penny stock”. A penny\nstock is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities to persons other than established Members\nand accredited investors. For transactions covered by these rules, the broker/dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of these\nsecurities. In addition, a broker/dealer must receive the purchaser’s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase and must also provide certain\nwritten disclosures to the purchaser. Consequently, the “penny stock” rules may restrict the ability of broker/dealers to sell our ordinary shares, and may\nnegatively affect the ability of holders of shares of our ordinary shares to resell them. These disclosures require you to acknowledge that you understand the\nrisks associated with buying penny stocks and that you can absorb the loss of your entire investment. Penny stocks generally do not have a very high\ntrading volume. Consequently, the price of the stock is often volatile and you may not be able to buy or sell the stock when you want to.\n17\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This\ncould cause the market price of our ordinary shares to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that these\nsales may occur, could result in a decrease in the market price of our ordinary shares. We have issued and outstanding 35,141,114 ordinary shares. Of that\namount, 24,784,800 shares are restricted as of May 8, 2020 as a result of securities laws and/or lock-up agreements, but will be able to be sold in the future\nsubject to securities laws and/or lock-up agreements. If held by one of our affiliates, the resale of those securities will also be subject to volume limitations\nunder Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nOur directors, officers and principal shareholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our\nother shareholders.\nOur officers, directors and principal shareholders holding more than 5% of our ordinary shares, collectively, control approximately 67% of our\noutstanding ordinary shares. As a result, these shareholders, if they act together, will be able to control the management and affairs of our Company and\nmost matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. The interests of these\nshareholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with your interests. For example, these shareholders could attempt to delay or prevent a change\nin control of our Company, even if such change in control would benefit our other shareholders which could deprive our shareholders of an opportunity to\nreceive a premium for their ordinary shares as part of a sale of our Company or our assets, and might affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary\nshares due to investors’ perceptions that conflicts of interest may exist or arise. As a result, this concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests\nof our other shareholders.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of proceeds from our initial public offering designated for working capital and general corporate purposes,\nand we may not succeed in using those net proceeds effectively.\nIn July 2019, we issued and sold 2,000,000 ordinary shares in our initial public offering. In connection with our initial public offering, we also issued\nand sold an additional 141,114 shares pursuant to the partial exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option. We intended to use the net proceeds from\nour initial public offering for research and development, including expanding our research and development team and continuing to invest in and develop\nour products, for selling and marketing, particularly strengthening our sales channels and establishing physical experience stores, and for working capital\nand general corporate purposes, including increasing our liquidity. In 2019, we used approximately $1.8 million of the net proceeds from our initial public\noffering for research and development, selling and marketing, and working capital and other general corporate purposes. Our management has broad\ndiscretion over the use and investment of the net proceeds from the initial public offering within those categories. Accordingly, investors have only limited\ninformation concerning management’s specific intentions and need to rely upon the judgment of our management with respect to the use of proceeds.\nWe incur significant additional costs as a result of being a public company, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant additional costs associated with corporate governance requirements that apply to us as a public company,\nincluding rules and regulations of the SEC, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and\nthe Exchange Act, as well as the rules of Nasdaq. Compliance with these rules and regulations will significantly increase our accounting, legal and financial\ncompliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming. We also expect these rules and regulations could make it more expensive for us to obtain\nand maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our\nboard of directors or as executive officers. Accordingly, such increases in costs incurred as a result of becoming a public company may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.\n18\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable\nassurance that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and\nrecorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls\nand procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system\nare met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error\nor mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized\noverride of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be\ndetected.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of\ninternal control, we may be unable to accurately report our operating results, meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our\ninternal controls and procedures. Our management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and\nour independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. In preparing our consolidated\nfinancial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, three material weaknesses were identified in our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the United States, and other significant\ndeficiencies. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a\nreasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely\nbasis. The three material weaknesses identified are as follows: (i) no sufficient personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience\nto address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii) ineffective\noversight of our financial reporting and internal control by those charged with governance; and (iii) inadequate design of internal control over the\npreparation of the financial statements being audited. These material weaknesses remained as of December 31, 2019. As a result of inherent limitations, our\ninternal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements, errors or omissions.\nWe are now a public company in the United States subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires\nthat we include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on Form 20-F beginning with our annual report\nfor the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. In addition, once we cease to be an “emerging growth company” as such term is defined under the Jumpstart\nOur Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective. Moreover, even if our\nmanagement concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm, after conducting its\nown independent testing, may issue a report that is qualified if it is not satisfied with our internal controls or the level at which our controls are\ndocumented, designed, operated or reviewed, or if it interprets the relevant requirements differently from us. In addition, our reporting obligations may\nplace a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future. We may be unable to timely\ncomplete our evaluation testing and any required remediation.\nDuring the course of documenting and testing our internal control procedures, in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act of 2002, we may identify other weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the\nadequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able\nto conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\nof 2002. Generally, if we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements, errors or omissions\nin our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial\ninformation. This could in turn limit our access to capital markets, and harm our results of operations. Additionally, ineffective internal control over\nfinancial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on\nwhich we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole\nsource of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development\nof our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our ordinary shares will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\n19\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our\nstock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares is influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us\nand our business. We do not control these analysts. As a newly public company, we may be slow to attract research coverage and the analysts who publish\ninformation about our ordinary shares will have had relatively little experience with us or our industry, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast\nour results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. If any of the analysts who cover us provide inaccurate or unfavorable research\nor issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish\nreports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and result in the\nloss of all or a part of your investment in us.\nRecently introduced economic substance legislation of the Cayman Islands may impact us and our operations.\nThe Cayman Islands, together with several other non-European Union jurisdictions, has recently introduced legislation aimed at addressing concerns\nraised by the Council of the European Union as to offshore structures engaged in certain activities which attract profits without real economic activity. With\neffect from January 1, 2019, the International Tax Co-operation (Economic Substance) Law, 2018, or the Substance Law, and issued Regulations and\nGuidance Notes came into force in the Cayman Islands introducing certain economic substance requirements for “relevant entities” which are engaged in\ncertain “relevant activities,” which in the case of exempted companies incorporated before January 1, 2019, will apply in respect of financial years\ncommencing July 1, 2019 and onwards. A “relevant entity” includes an exempted company incorporated in the Cayman Islands; however, it does not\ninclude an entity that is tax resident outside the Cayman Islands. Accordingly, for so long as we are a tax resident outside the Cayman Islands, we are not\nrequired to satisfy the economic substance test. Although it is presently anticipated that the Substance Law will have little material impact on us and our\noperations, as the legislation is new and remains subject to further clarification and interpretation it is not currently possible to ascertain the precise impact\nof these legislative changes on us and our operations.\nYou may face difficulties in protecting your interests, and your ability to protect your rights through U.S. courts may be limited, because we are\nincorporated under Cayman Islands law.\nWe are an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Our corporate affairs are governed by our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association, the Companies Law (as amended) of the Cayman Islands and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights\nof shareholders to take action against our directors, actions by our minority shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors to us under Cayman\nIslands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from\ncomparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from the common law of England, the decisions of whose courts are of\npersuasive authority, but are not binding, on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors under\nCayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In\nparticular, the Cayman Islands have a less developed body of securities laws than the United States. Some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have more fully\ndeveloped and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to\ninitiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States.\nShareholders of Cayman Islands exempted companies like us have no general rights under Cayman Islands law to inspect corporate records or to\nobtain copies of lists of shareholders of these companies. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, our directors have\ndiscretion to determine whether or not, and under what conditions, our corporate records may be inspected by our shareholders, but are not obliged to make\nthem available to our shareholders. This may make it more difficult for you to obtain the information needed to establish any facts necessary for a\nshareholder motion or to solicit proxies from other shareholders in connection with a proxy contest.\nCertain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands, which is our home country, differ significantly from requirements for companies\nincorporated in other jurisdictions such as the United States. Currently, we do not plan to rely on home country practice with respect to any corporate\ngovernance matter. To the extent we choose to follow home country practice with respect to corporate governance matters, our shareholders may be\nafforded less protection than they otherwise would under rules and regulations applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\nAs a result of all of the above, our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by\nmanagement, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as public shareholders of a company incorporated in the\nUnited States.\n20\nCertain judgments obtained against us by our shareholders may not be enforceable.\nWe are a Cayman Islands company and substantially all of our assets are located outside of the United States. Substantially all of our current operations\nare conducted in China. In addition, most of our current directors and officers are nationals and residents of countries other than the United States.\nSubstantially all of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to bring an action\nagainst us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe that your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the Cayman Islands and of China may render you\nunable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements.\nWe are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from requirements applicable\nto other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, most significantly, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation\nrequirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. As a result, if we elect not to\ncomply with such auditor attestation requirements, our investors may not have access to certain information they may deem important.\nThe JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until\nsuch date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. We do not plan to “opt out” of such\nexemptions afforded to an emerging growth company. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that\ncomply with public company effective data.\nWe qualify as a foreign private issuer and, as a result, we are not be subject to U.S. proxy rules and are subject to Exchange Act reporting\nobligations that permit less detailed and less frequent reporting than that of a U.S. domestic public company.\nWe report under the Exchange Act as a non-U.S. company with foreign private issuer status. Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under the\nExchange Act, we are exempt from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that are applicable to U.S. domestic public companies, including (i) the sections\nof the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies, consents or authorizations in respect of a security registered under the Exchange Act; (ii) the\nsections of the Exchange Act requiring insiders to file public reports of their stock ownership and trading activities and liability for insiders who profit from\ntrades made in a short period of time; and (iii) the rules under the Exchange Act requiring the filing with the SEC of quarterly reports on Form 10-\nQ containing unaudited financial and other specified information, or current reports on Form 8-K upon the occurrence of specified significant events. In\naddition, our officers, directors and principal shareholders are exempt from the reporting and “short-swing” profit recovery provisions of Section 16 of the\nExchange Act and the rules thereunder. Therefore, our shareholders may not know on a timely basis when our officers, directors and principal shareholders\npurchase or sell our ordinary shares. In addition, foreign private issuers are not required to file their annual report on Form 20-F until 120 days after the end\nof each fiscal year, while U.S. domestic issuers that are accelerated filers are required to file their annual report on Form 10-K within 75 days after the end\nof each fiscal year. Foreign private issuers also are exempt from Regulation Fair Disclosure, aimed at preventing issuers from making selective disclosures\nof material information. As a result of the above, you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are not foreign private\nissuers.\nIf we lose our status as a foreign private issuer, we would be required to comply with the Exchange Act reporting and other requirements applicable to\nU.S. domestic issuers, which are more detailed and extensive than the requirements for foreign private issuers. We may also be required to make changes in\nour corporate governance practices in accordance with various SEC and Nasdaq rules. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws\nif we are required to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly higher than the cost we would incur\nas a foreign private issuer. As a result, we expect that a loss of foreign private issuer status would increase our legal and financial compliance costs and\nwould make some activities highly time consuming and costly. We also expect that if we were required to comply with the rules and regulations applicable\nto U.S. domestic issuers, it would make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain and maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, and we may\nbe required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult\nfor us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to adopt certain home country practices in relation to corporate governance matters that differ\nsignificantly from Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. These practices may afford less protection to shareholders than they would enjoy if\nwe complied fully with corporate governance listing standards.\nAs a foreign private issuer, we are permitted to take advantage of certain provisions in the Nasdaq rules that allow us to follow our home country law\nfor certain governance matters. Certain corporate governance practices in our home country, the Cayman Islands, may differ significantly from corporate\ngovernance listing standards. Currently, we do not plan to rely on home country practice with respect to our corporate governance. However, if we choose\nto follow home country practice in the future, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they would otherwise enjoy under the Nasdaq\ncorporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.\n21\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any\ntaxable year, which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders of our ordinary shares.\nA non-U.S. corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable year if either (1) at least 75% of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of\n“passive” income; or (2) at least 50% of the value of its assets (based on an average of the quarterly values of the assets) during such year is attributable to\nassets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income (the “asset test”). Based on our current and expected income and assets\n(taking into account the expected cash proceeds and our market capitalization), we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for the current taxable year or the\nforeseeable future. However, no assurance can be given in this regard because the determination of whether we are or will become a PFIC is a fact-\nintensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part, upon the composition of our income and assets. In addition, there can be no assurance that\nthe Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, will agree with our conclusion or that the IRS would not successfully challenge our position. Fluctuations in the\nmarket price of our ordinary shares may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of our assets for the\npurpose of the asset test may be determined by reference to the market price of our ordinary shares. The composition of our income and assets may also be\naffected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets and the cash raised in our initial public offering. If we were to be or become a PFIC for any\ntaxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. Holder.\nSee “Taxation— Passive Foreign Investment Company Consequences.”\nWe may lose our foreign private issuer status in the future, which could result in significant additional costs and expenses.\nAs discussed above, we are a foreign private issuer, and therefore, we are not required to comply with all of the periodic disclosure and current\nreporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The determination of foreign private issuer status is made annually on the last business day of an issuer’s most\nrecently completed second fiscal quarter. We would lose our foreign private issuer status if, for example, more than 50% of our ordinary shares are directly\nor indirectly held by residents of the United States and we fail to meet additional requirements necessary to maintain our foreign private issuer status. If we\nlose our foreign private issuer status on this date, we will be required to file with the SEC periodic reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic\nissuer forms, which are more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. We will also have to mandatorily comply with U.S.\nfederal proxy requirements, and our officers, directors and principal shareholders will become subject to the short-swing profit disclosure and recovery\nprovisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, we will lose our ability to rely upon exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements\nunder the Nasdaq rules. As a U.S. listed public company that is not a foreign private issuer, we will incur significant additional legal, accounting and other\nexpenses that we will not incur as a foreign private issuer, and accounting, reporting and other expenses in order to maintain a listing on a U.S. securities\nexchange.\n22\nITEM 4. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY\nA. History and Development of the Company\nOur company, Blue Hat Interactive Entertainment Technology, is a holding company incorporated on June 13, 2018 under the laws of the Cayman\nIslands, or Blue Hat.\nWe have no substantive operations other than holding all of the issued and outstanding shares of Brilliant Hat Limited, or Blue Hat BVI, established\nunder the laws of the British Virgin Islands on June 26, 2018.\nBlue Hat BVI is also a holding company holding all of the outstanding equity of Blue Hat Interactive Entertainment Technology Limited, or Blue Hat\nHK, which was established in Hong Kong on June 26, 2018. Blue Hat HK is also a holding company holding all of the outstanding equity of Xiamen\nDuwei Consulting Management Co., Ltd., or Blue Hat WFOE, which was established on July 26, 2018 under the laws of the PRC.\nWe, through our variable interest entity, or VIE, Fujian Blue Hat Interactive Entertainment Technology Ltd., or Blue Hat Fujian, a PRC company, and\nthrough its wholly owned subsidiaries, including Hunan Engaomei Animation Culture Development Co., Ltd., or Blue Hat Hunan, and Shenyang\nQimengxing Trading Co., Ltd., or Blue Hat Shenyang, each a PRC company, engage in designing, producing, promoting and selling animated toys with\nmobile games features, original intellectual property and peripheral derivatives features worldwide.\nOn September 18, 2017, Blue Hat Fujian formed a joint venture with Xiamen Youth Education Development Co., Ltd. and Youying Wang,\ncontributing a 48.5% equity interest in Fujian Youth Hand in Hand Educational Technology Co., Ltd., or Fujian Youth, a PRC company. As of December\n31, 2019, Fujian Youth had no operations.\nOn January 25, 2018, Blue Hat Fujian established its wholly owned subsidiary, Chongqing Lanhui Technology Co. Ltd., or Blue Hat Chongqing, a\nPRC company. As of December 31, 2019, Blue Hat Chongqing had no operations.\nOn September 10, 2018, Blue Hat Fujian established its wholly owned subsidiary, Pingxiang Blue Hat Technology Co. Ltd., or Blue Hat Pingxiang, a\nPRC company. Blue Hat Pingxiang also engages in designing, producing, promoting and selling interactive toys with mobile games features, original\nintellectual property and peripheral derivatives features worldwide.\nOn September 20, 2018, Blue Hat Fujian formed a joint venture with Fujian Jin Ge Tie Ma Information Technology Co., contributing a 20.0% equity\ninterest in Xiamen Blue Wave Technology Co. Ltd., or Xiamen Blue Wave, a PRC company.\nOn October 16, 2018, Blue Hat Fujian formed a joint venture with Renchao Huyu (Shanghai) Culture Development Co. Ltd., contributing a 49%\nownership interest in Renchao Huyu (Shanghai) Culture Propagation Co. Ltd., or Renchao Huyu, with the remaining 51% ownership owned by Renchao\nHuyu (Shanghai) Culture Development Co. Ltd.\nOn November 13, 2018, Blue Hat completed a reorganization of entities under common control of its then existing shareholders, who collectively\nowned a majority of the equity interests of Blue Hat prior to the reorganization. Blue Hat, Blue Hat BVI, and Blue Hat HK were established as the holding\ncompanies of Blue Hat WFOE. Blue Hat WFOE is the primary beneficiary of Blue Hat Fujian and its subsidiaries, and all of these entities included in Blue\nHat are under common control which results in the consolidation of Blue Hat Fujian and subsidiaries which have been accounted for as a reorganization of\nentities under common control at carrying value. The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis as if the reorganization became effective\nas of the beginning of the first period presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n23\nContractual Arrangements\nDue to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, the production, development and operation of AR interactive\nentertainment games and toys in China, including interactive educational materials, mobile games, and toys with mobile game features, we operate our\nbusinesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through certain PRC domestic companies. As such, Blue Hat Fujian is\ncontrolled through contractual arrangements in lieu of direct equity ownership by us or any of our subsidiaries. Such contractual arrangements consist of a\nseries of three agreements, along with shareholders’ POAs and irrevocable commitment letters, or collectively, the Contractual Arrangements, which were\nsigned on November 13, 2018.\nThe significant terms of the Contractual Arrangements are as follows:\nExclusive Business Cooperation Agreement\nPursuant to the exclusive business cooperation agreement between Blue Hat WFOE and Blue Hat Fujian, Blue Hat WFOE has the exclusive right to\nprovide Blue Hat Fujian with technical support services, consulting services and other services, including technical support, technical assistance, technical\nconsulting, and professional training necessary for Blue Hat Fujian’s operation, network support, database support, software services, business management\nconsulting, grant use rights of intellectual property rights, lease hardware and device, provide system integration service, research and development of\nsoftware and system maintenance, provide labor support and to develop the related technologies based on Blue Hat Fujian’s needs. In exchange, Blue Hat\nWFOE is entitled to a service fee that equals to all of the consolidated net income after offsetting previous year’s loss (if any) of Blue Hat Fujian. The\nservice fee may be adjusted by Blue Hat WFOE based on the actual scope of services rendered by Blue Hat WFOE and the operational needs and\nexpanding demands of Blue Hat Fujian.\nPursuant to the exclusive business cooperation agreement, Blue Hat WFOE has the unilateral right to adjust the service fee at any time, and Blue Hat\nFujian has no right to adjust the service fee. We believe that such conditions under which the service fee may be adjusted will be primarily based on the\nneeds of Blue Hat Fujian to operate and develop its business in the AR market. For example, if Blue Hat Fujian needs to expand its business, increase\nresearch input or consummate mergers or acquisitions in the future, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to decrease the amount of the service fee, which would\nallow Blue Hat Fujian to have additional capital to operate and develop its business in the AR market.\nThe exclusive business cooperation agreement remains in effect until November 13, 2028 and shall be automatically renewed for one year at the\nexpiration date of the validity term. However, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to terminate this agreement upon giving 30 days’ prior written notice to Blue\nHat Fujian at any time.\nCall Option Agreements\nPursuant to the call option agreements, among Blue Hat WFOE, Blue Hat Fujian and the shareholders who collectively owned all of Blue Hat Fujian,\nsuch shareholders jointly and severally grant Blue Hat WFOE an option to purchase their equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian. The purchase price shall be\nthe lowest price then permitted under applicable PRC laws. Blue Hat WFOE or its designated person may exercise such option at any time to purchase all\nor part of the equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian until it has acquired all equity interests of Blue Hat Fujian, which is irrevocable during the term of the\nagreements.\nThe call option agreements remain in effect until November 13, 2028 and shall be automatically renewed for one year at the expiration date of the\nvalidity term. However, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to terminate these agreements upon giving 30 days’ prior written notice to Blue Hat Fujian at any\ntime.\nEquity Pledge Agreement\nPursuant to the equity pledge agreement among the shareholders who collectively owned all of Blue Hat Fujian, such shareholders pledge all of the\nequity interests in Blue Hat Fujian to Blue Hat WFOE as collateral to secure the obligations of Blue Hat Fujian under the exclusive business cooperation\nagreement and call option agreements. These shareholders are prohibited or may not transfer the pledged equity interests without prior consent of Blue Hat\nWFOE unless transferring the equity interests to Blue Hat WFOE or its designated person in accordance to the call option agreements.\nThe equity pledge agreement shall come into force the date on which the pledged interests is recorded, which is three days after signing of the\nAgreement on November 13, 2018, under Blue Hat Fujian’s register of shareholders and is registered with competent administration for industry and\ncommerce of Blue Hat Fujian until all of the liabilities and debts to Blue Hat WFOE have been fulfilled completely by Blue Hat Fujian. Blue Hat Fujian\nand the shareholders who collectively owned all of Blue Hat Fujian shall not terminate these agreements in any circumstance for any reason. However,\nBlue Hat WFOE has the right to terminate these agreements upon giving 30 days’ prior written notice to Blue Hat Fujian at any time.\n24\nShareholders’ POAs\nPursuant to the shareholders’ POAs, the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian give Blue Hat WFOE an irrevocable proxy to act on their behalf on all\nmatters pertaining to Blue Hat Fujian and to exercise all of their rights as shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian, including the right to attend shareholders\nmeeting, to exercise voting rights and all of the other rights, and to sign transfer documents and any other documents in relation to the fulfillment of the\nobligations under the call option agreements and the equity pledge agreement. The POAs shall remain in effect while the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian\nhold the equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian.\nIrrevocable Commitment Letters\nPursuant to the irrevocable commitment letters, the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian commit that their spouses or inheritors have no right to claim any\nrights or interest in relation to the shares that they hold in Blue Hat Fujian and have no right to impose any impact on the daily managing duties of Blue Hat\nFujian, and commit that if any event which refrains them from exercising shareholders’ rights as a registered shareholder, such as death, incapacity, divorce\nor any other event, could happen to them, the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian will take corresponding measures to guarantee the rights of other registered\nshareholders and the performance of the Contractual Arrangements. The letters are irrevocable and shall not be withdrawn without the consent of Blue Hat\nWFOE.\nBased on the foregoing contractual arrangements, which grant Blue Hat WFOE effective control of Blue Hat Fujian and enable Blue Hat WFOE to\nreceive all of their expected residual returns, we account for Blue Hat Fujian as a VIE. Accordingly, we consolidate the accounts of Blue Hat Fujian for the\nperiods presented herein, in accordance with Regulation S-X-3A-02 promulgated by the SEC, and ASC 810-10, Consolidation.\nOn July 30, 2019, we completed our initial public offering, and since July 26, 2019, our ordinary shares have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market\nunder the symbol “BHAT”.\nOur principal executive office is located at 7th Floor, Building C, No. 1010 Anling Road, Huli District, Xiamen, China 361009. Our telephone number\nis 86-592-228-0081. Our registered office in the Cayman Islands is located at the offices of Walkers Corporate Limited, Cayman Corporate Centre, 27\nHospital Road, George Town, Grand Cayman KY1-9008, Cayman Islands.\nThe SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically\nwith the SEC on www.sec.gov. You can also find information on our website located at http://www.irbluehatgroup.com. Information contained on, or that\ncan be accessed through, our website is not a part of, and shall not be incorporated by reference into, this annual report.\nWe have not had any material commitments for capital expenditures for the last three financial years.\nB. Business Overview\nWe are a producer, developer and operator of augmented reality, or AR, interactive entertainment games and toys in China, including interactive\neducational materials, mobile games, and toys with mobile game features. Our mobile-connected entertainment platform enables us to connect physical\nitems to mobile devices through wireless technologies, creating a unique interactive user experience. Our goal is to create a rich visual and interactive\nenvironment for users through the integration of real objects and virtual scenery. We believe this combination provides users with a more natural form of\nhuman-computer interaction and enhances users’ perception of reality, thus providing a more diversified entertainment experience. By leveraging our\nstrong technological capabilities and infrastructure, we believe we are able to deliver a superior user experience and conduct our operations in a highly\nefficient manner.\nThe core of our business is our proprietary technology. Our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights serve to distinguish\nour products, protect our products from infringement, and contribute to our competitive advantages. To secure the value of our technology and\ndevelopments, we are aggressive in pursuing a combination of patent, trademark and copyright protection for our proprietary technologies. As of December\n31, 2019, we had 199 authorized patents, 37 patents pending in various stages of the application process, 13 applications for PCT international patents and\n1 authorized patent for PCT international patents, and 37 patents pending in various stages of the application process. As of December 31, 2019, we also\nhad 645 copyrights of art work, 29 software copyrights and 95 registered trademarks.\n25\nWe strive to create an engaging, interactive and immersive community for users of our products. The majority of our users are among the young\nChinese generation between the ages of 3 and 23, although many of our products appeal to users outside of this demographic. We intend to further penetrate\nthe Chinese market with new products that will target users ages 14 and above. Specifically, our strategies include marketing Fidolle, a ball-jointed “smart\ndoll”, and QI, a gaming and entertainment platform designed for both family home use and amusement arcades. We believe our high-quality content is a\nmagnet for users with common interests to connect, interact and share their passions on our platform, which helps to cultivate a strong sense of belonging,\neffectively strengthening our user retention.\nOur products resemble traditional children’s toys - including cars, ladybugs, picture books, and dolls - which are enabled with wireless technology to\nfacilitate a broad variety of interactive functions. The interactive functionality of our products broadens the user experience, creates a communicative\nenvironment, and facilitates an ongoing relationship between us and our end users and between our end users and our products. We believe such an\nimmersive entertainment experience allows our users to build strong emotional connections to our products, resulting in our products typically having\nlonger life cycles than traditional toys.\nOur proprietary technology, product research and development, marketing channels and brand operation are the cornerstones of our business. We focus\non the combination of “online” and “offline” activity and the interaction between “entertainment” and “product” to create a high-tech entertainment\nplatform combining mobile games and AR. With the help of computer graphics and visualization technologies, we are able to accurately “place” virtual\nobjects into the physical world, thus creating a new and stimulating visual environment for our users.\nFor information on our financial performance, see “Item 5.A. Operating Results.”\nOur Products\nWe currently offer the following primary AR interactive product lines: AR Racer, AR Crazy Bug (previously named “AR Need a Spanking”), AR 3D\nMagic Box, AR Dinosaur, “Talking Tom and Friends” Bouncing Bubble, and Immersive Education Classes.\nAR Racer\nAR Racer is a car-racing mobile game played using a physical toy car stuck onto the user’s mobile device screen using non-adhesive materials. Blue\nHat’s photosensitive recognition technology allows the toy car to be used as a controller, so that users can virtually race one another via the simulated\nracing track, as well as engage in individual races.\nAR Crazy Bug (previously named “AR Need a Spanking”)\nAR Crazy Bug is an exciting combat game played using a ladybug-shaped electronic toy. Blue Hat’s infrared induction technology allows the user to\ncontrol the toy’s movement via their mobile device for game play in battle dynamics, while simultaneously moving the toy in reality. The mobile device\nshows virtual enemies while also capturing the position of the toy in the real world, allowing the user to approach or escape its combatants.\nAR 3D Magic Box\nAR 3D Magic Box has the unique ability to transport children’s drawings into diverse backgrounds, giving the user a discovery-based experience. AR\n3D Magic Box uses AR recognition technology to allow children to draw shapes or objects onto a physical card while the mobile game captures the\ndrawings and animates them onto a set background, for example, under the sea.\nAR Dinosaur\nAR Dinosaur is an educational toy that comes in a variety of five different types of dinosaur, each of which has their own personality and emotions.\nThrough interacting with the toy and its accompanying mobile app, children can learn a wealth of information about dinosaurs. The product comes with\nfive physical “AR cards”, which when placed under the toy will activate its AR features.\n26\n“Talking Tom and Friends” Bouncing Bubble\nBouncing Bubble is a product designed using environmentally-friendly and toxic-free liquid, allowing for larger, stronger bubbles that won’t easily\npop. Children can bounce these bubbles using a paddle or gloves as if they were ping pong balls. The new “Talking Tom and Friends” Bouncing Bubble\nproduct range features images of characters from the universe of the globally renowned “Talking Tom and Friends” media franchise.\nImmersive Education Classes\nImmersive Education Classes is Blue Hat’s range of immersive educational products that utilize AR technology to create a dynamic and engaging\nmodel for teaching in China’s preschools, including “Smart Screen Immersive Education Classes”, “Smart Immersive Physical Education Classes” and\n“Smart Immersive Cognitive Education Classes.” The three products are suitable for different teaching scenarios, and can be used independently or\ntogether with one another to promote children’s overall development.\n“Smart Screen Immersive Education Classes” use a projector to cast education-related content and games onto the classroom wall. Activities featured\nwithin the product aim to improve students’ hand-eye coordination and analytical abilities, and students are guided by teachers trained in the product’s use.\nAfter students have completed a task, their results are shown on the screen and specific feedback for improvement is provided.\n“Smart Immersive Physical Education Classes” integrate a projector and motion-capture system to project activities and games onto the floor of the\nteaching area. Students who participate in activities are required to imitate movements and react in time, while competing or coordinating with others for\nthe best score. Data is analyzed simultaneously for each student, with feedback, including scores and suggestions for improvement, that can be reviewed by\nteachers and parents. All activities are carefully guided by teachers trained in the product’s use.\n“Smart Immersive Cognitive Education Classes” offer a wide variety of AR-enabled tasks designed to exercise the cognitive abilities of children\nbetween the ages of three and six years old by projecting images and activities onto a classroom tabletop. As the images projected on the tabletop react to\nchildren’s movements, they can learn for themselves, with feedback, including scores and suggestions for improvement, projected onto the table after\ncompletion. A tabletop can be used by up to six children at one time, supporting both independent learning and group activities or competitions. The\nproduct’s content has been designed by our in-house team of educational experts and all activities are carefully guided by teachers trained in the product’s\nuse.\nSales and Marketing\nOur marketing operations consist of a planning department, a sales department, an e-commerce department and a product department. We are in the\nprocess of expanding our e-commerce sales team, and we are transitioning from single, offline promotional activities to diversified, online interactive\nmarketing and digital marketing. We intend to increase our branding and advertising activities via online communities, social media and television, thus\nincreasing our brand awareness.\nWe have an experienced sales team with more than 35 staff members, many of which have several years of sales experience. Currently, our sales are\nprimarily derived from developed eastern regions of China such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. We intend to expand into more diverse regions of China in an\neffort to increase our market share. Currently, we have four subsidiaries located in Chongqing, Hunan, Fujian and Shenyang, responsible for sales and\nmarketing.\nWe intend to continue building our salesforce and enhancing our sales power. We plan to penetrate the market further through our physical presence in\nstores and our e-commerce platforms. We also plan to establish flexible and diversified sales channels. For sales in China, we plan to continue to use\ndistributors and our sales team will engage e-commerce channels. We also intend to continue to partner with provincial Chinese distributors to expand both\nour online and offline sales channels and to further infiltrate sales regions.\n27\nWe believe that the key factors influencing our sales patterns are as follows:\n● Consumer Groups – We believe that China’s extensive population base demonstrates the market potential in China. We believe that demand for\nAR interactive toys will continue to expand as China’s population continues to grow.\n● Consumption Patterns and Consumption Habits – We believe that the development and increasing popularity of mobile payment systems and\napplications, internet and e-commerce shopping, along with the rapid growth of the Chinese social economy have greatly impacted the\nconsumption patterns of Chinese society. Increased consumption habits of the general public allow for significant growth of AR products as\npeople are more likely to spend money on entertainment, particularly entertainment that operates on the same wireless technology platforms as\ntheir computers and mobile devices, such as our products.\n● Seasonal Factors – The majority of our sales typically occur in the second half of the year during traditional Chinese holidays due to promotional\nactivities and increased sales that typically accompany holiday shopping.\nOur long-term branding development plan centers around brand recognition and increasing our brand awareness through the use of branding strategies\nsuch as market surveys, series designs and after-sales investigations. Our goal is to obtain a thorough understanding of user preferences and purchasing\ntrends in order to increase confidence in our product quality, heighten brand loyalty, and increase the overall value of our brand. We intend to alter our\nproduct designs to meet consumers’ needs and adjust to market changes accordingly.\nAs discussed, we are in the process of expanding our brand to physical experience stores in order to engage consumers, create user loyalty and\nintroduce new users to our products. We are leveraging our experience and insight into traditional toy and gaming industries and our strength in AR\ntechnologies to build experience stores that provide customers with a variety of AR interactive activities, as well as a location to purchase AR interactive\ntoys.\nProduct Quality\nWe emphasize the importance of quality and safety in our products throughout our product life cycle. During the product development stage, our\nspecialized quality control engineers submit sample products for inspection before the products leave our on-site studio. Each product design also\nundergoes stringent tests for sample confirmation and material selection before any orders are placed with suppliers. All product changes are repeatedly\ntested repeatedly and fully verified before production is altered accordingly.\nOur manufacturers are selected based on their productivity and are then evaluated based on our production requirements, including management\nneeds, technical skills, file management, quality control, and company size. After a supplier is examined and confirmed by each of our relevant\ndepartments, it will be included in our supplier directory. We also conduct field assessments of our long-term suppliers from time to time.\nOur products also undergo a series of quality inspections throughout the manufacturing process, including material confirmation, initial workpiece\ninspection, process inspection and delivery inspection. All of our products currently comply with China 3C standards, China’s toy industry safety\nstandards, as revised on January 1, 2016 by GB6675-2003 National Toy’s Safety Technical Specifications, and the American Society for Testing and\nMaterials standards.\nIntellectual Property\nThe core of our business is our proprietary technology. As a result, we strive to maintain a robust intellectual property portfolio. Our patents,\ntrademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights serve to distinguish and protect our products from infringement and contribute to our\ncompetitive advantages. To secure the value of our technology and developments, we are aggressive in pursuing a combination of patent, trademark, and\ncopyright protection for our proprietary technologies. As of December 31, 2019, we had 199 authorized patents, 37 patents pending in various stages of the\napplication process, 13 applications for PCT international patents, 1 authorized patent for PCT international patents, and 37 patents pending in various\nstages of the application process. As of December 31, 2019, we also had 645 copyrights of art work, 29 software copyrights and 95 registered trademarks.\n28\nResearch and Development\nWe believe the key to success in the AR interactive toy market is research and development. As such, we have invested, and intend to continue to\ninvest, substantial resources in the research and development of AR interactive technologies. We maintain two high quality research and development\nteams responsible for hardware and software design. Both research and development teams consist of 49 AR specialists, including many top talented\nindividuals in the AR field, and are led by individuals with experience from China’s prominent internet game developers and operators. Approximately 28\nmembers of our research and development team are based in Xiamen, mainly focusing on the research and development of electronic toys, AR games and\nproducts for licensing. Approximately 21 members of our research and development team are based at our Fuzhou branch, focusing on mobile games and\nAR game research and development. We also cooperate with several third party research and development teams. For example, we are partnering with\nFujian Normal University Embedded Development Laboratory on the development of our Qi Platform. For example, we provide the funding for the project\nwith Fujian Normal University, and in turn, we are able to use the facilities of Fujian Normal University and retain the intellectual property developed\nduring the project.\nOur research and development process for a new or enhanced product typically starts with our research and development team brainstorming with our\nmarketing and sales team to create new ideas and designs containing popular elements. Our marketing and sales team will gather information about the\nmarket demand from distributors through exhibitions that they attend. Our marketing and sales team and our research and development team will hold\nmeetings to discuss and summarize the information and determine which potential products they expect to be popular among existing and new customers.\nOur research and development team will then determine the feasibility of the proposed new products. From time to time, our research and development\nteam will generate ideas for new products from a technological perspective and communicate such ideas with the marketing and sales team. These ideas are\nthen presented to our senior management team for approval. If the proposal is approved by senior management, the company will officially establish the\nproject of developing the new product.\nOur standard research and development cycle per product is approximately eight months. Initial product development usually takes two to three\nmonths in order to produce quality product samples. For product samples put into production, it usually takes an additional four to eight months for further\ndevelopment and design.\nOur research and development department is currently focusing on the further advancement of the technology used in our products, including\nphotosensitive induction technology, gesture-sensor technology, infrared induction technology and AR identification technology. We have invested, and\nwill continue to invest, substantial resources in our research and development activities, including technology and game development.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change and disruptive technology. We compete with AR interactive toy companies located around\nthe world, and we may also face competition from new and emerging companies, including new competitors from the PRC. We consider our principal\ncompetitors to be those companies that provide educational AR game products to the market, including Shanghai Putao Technology Co., Ltd. and Sphero,\nInc. We also compete with Nintendo of America Inc.’s amiibo product line.\nCompared to our company, our current and potential competitors may have:\n● better established credibility and market reputations, longer operating histories, and broader product offerings;\n● significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, which may allow them to pursue design, development, manufacturing,\nsales, marketing, distribution and service support of their products;\n● more extensive customer and partner relationships, which may position them to identify and respond more successfully to market developments\nand changes in customer demands; and\n● multiple product offerings, which may enable them to offer bundled discounts for customers purchasing multiple products or other incentives that\nwe cannot match or offer.\n29\nThe principal competitive factors in our market include:\n● brand recognition and reputation;\n● ability to build customer loyalty, retain existing users and attract new users;\n● continually-evolving innovation and research and development; and\n● the performance and reliability of products and platforms.\nWe believe we compete favorably with respect to the factors described above.\nLegal Regulations on Intellectual Property in the PRC\nCopyright\nPursuant to the Copyright Law of the PRC, which was first promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on September\n7, 1990 and became effective from June 1, 1991, and was last amended on February 26, 2010 and became effective as of April 1, 2010, copyrights include\npersonal rights such as the right of publication and that of attribution as well as property rights such as the right of production and that of distribution.\nReproducing, distributing, performing, projecting, broadcasting or compiling a work or communicating the same to the public via an information network\nwithout permission from the owner of the copyright therein, unless otherwise provided in the Copyright Law of the PRC, shall constitute infringements of\ncopyrights.

An enterprise must provide social insurance by processing social insurance registration with local social insurance agencies, and shall\npay or withhold relevant social insurance premiums for or on behalf of employees. The Law on Social Insurance of the PRC, which was promulgated by\nthe Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on October 28, 2010, and became effective on July 1, 2011, and was most recently updated on\nDecember 29, 2018, has consolidated pertinent provisions for basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, work injury\ninsurance and basic medical insurance, and has elaborated in detail the legal obligations and liabilities of employers who do not comply with relevant laws\nand regulations on social insurance.\nAccording to the Interim Measures for Participation in the Social Insurance System by Foreigners Working within the Territory of China, which was\npromulgated by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security on September 6, 2011, and became effective on October 15, 2011, employers who\nemploy foreigners shall participate in the basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, occupational injury insurance, and\nmaternity leave insurance in accordance with the relevant law, with the social insurance premiums to be contributed respectively by the employers and\nforeigner employees as required.

The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law applies a uniform 25 percent enterprise income tax rate to both FIEs and domestic\nenterprises, except where tax incentives are granted to special industries and projects. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law defines “resident enterprise” as\nan enterprise established outside of the territory of China but with its “de facto management body” within China, which will also be subject to the 25%\nenterprise income tax rate. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as the body that exercises full and substantial control\nand overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts, and properties of an enterprise. Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law\nand its implementation regulations, dividends generated from the business of a PRC subsidiary after January 1, 2008, and payable to its foreign investor\nmay be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10 percent if the PRC tax authorities determine that the foreign investor is a Non-resident Enterprise, unless\nthere is a tax treaty with China that provides for a preferential withholding tax rate. Distributions of earnings generated before January 1, 2008, are exempt\nfrom PRC withholding tax.\nIn January 2009, the SAT promulgated the Provisional Measures for the Administration of Withholding of Enterprise Income Tax for Non-resident\nEnterprises, or the Non-resident Enterprises Measures, which was repealed by Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to\nWithholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises in December 2017. According to the new announcement, it shall apply to handling of\nmatters relating to withholding at source of income tax of non-resident enterprises pursuant to the provisions of Article 37, Article 39 and Article 40 of the\nEnterprise Income Tax Law. According to Article 37, Article 39 of the Enterprise Income Tax Law, income tax over non-resident enterprise income\npursuant to the provisions of the third paragraph of Article 3 shall be subject to withholding at the source, where the payer shall act as the withholding\nagent. The tax amount for each payment made or due shall be withheld by the withholding agent from the amount paid or payable. Where a withholding\nagent fails to withhold tax or perform tax withholding obligations pursuant to the provisions of Article 37, the taxpayer shall pay tax at the place where the\nincome is derived. Where the taxpayer fails to pay tax pursuant to law, the tax authorities may demand payment of the tax amount payable, from a payer of\nthe taxpayer with payable tax amounts from other taxable income items in China.\nOn April 30, 2009, the MOF and the SAT jointly issued the Circular on Issues Concerning Treatment of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise\nRestructuring Business, or Circular 59, which became effective retroactively as of January 1, 2008 and was partially revised on January 1, 2014. By\npromulgating and implementing this circular, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a\nPRC resident enterprise by a Non-resident Enterprise.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Relating to Enterprise Income Tax\nof Transfers of Assets between Non-resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, which was partially abolished on December 29, 2017. SAT Bulletin 7 extends\nits tax jurisdiction to transactions involving transfer of immovable property in China and assets held under the establishment, and placement in China, of a\nforeign company through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. SAT Bulletin 7 also addresses transfer of the equity interest in a\nforeign intermediate holding company broadly. In addition, SAT Bulletin 7 introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to internal group restructurings.\nHowever, it also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee of the Indirect Transfer as they have to assess whether the transaction should\nbe subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly.\n32\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-\nresident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017 and was revised on June 15, 2018. The SAT\nBulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax.\nIf non-resident investors were involved in our private equity financing, if such transactions were determined by the tax authorities to lack reasonable\ncommercial purpose, we and our non-resident investors may be at risk of being required to file a return and be taxed under SAT Bulletin 7 and we may be\nrequired to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 or to establish that we should not be held liable for any obligations under SAT\nBulletin 7.\nValue-Added Tax\nAccording to the Temporary Regulations on Value-added Tax, which was most recently amended on November 19, 2017, and the Detailed\nImplementing Rules of the Temporary Regulations on Value-added Tax, which was amended on October 28, 2011, and became effective on November 1,\n2011, all taxpayers selling goods, providing processing, repair or replacement services or importing goods within the PRC shall pay Value-Added Tax. The\ntax rate of 17 percent shall be levied on general taxpayers selling or importing various goods; the tax rate of 17 percent shall be levied on the taxpayers\nproviding processing, repairing or replacement service; the applicable rate for the export of goods by taxpayers shall be nil, unless otherwise stipulated. On\nApril 4, 2018, the Ministry of Finance and the SAT jointly issued the Notice of Adjustment of Value-added Tax Rates which declared that the VAT tax rate\nin regard to the sale of goods, provision of processing, repairs and replacement services and importation of goods into China shall be reduced from the\nprevious 17% to 16% from May 1, 2018.\nFurthermore, according to the Trial Scheme for the Conversion of Business Tax to Value-added Tax, which was promulgated by the MOF and the SAT,\nthe PRC began to launch taxation reforms in a gradual manner in January 1, 2012, whereby the collection of value-added tax in lieu of business tax items\nwas implemented on a trial basis in regions showing significant radiating effects in economic development and providing outstanding reform examples,\nbeginning with production service industries such as transportation and certain modern service industries.\nIn accordance with a SAT circular that took effect on May 1, 2016, upon approval of the State Council, the pilot program of the collection of value-\nadded tax in lieu of business tax shall be promoted nationwide in a comprehensive manner starting May 1, 2016, and all taxpayers of business tax engaged\nin the building industry, the real estate industry, the financial industry and the life service industry shall be included in the scope of the pilot program with\nregard to payment of value-added tax instead of business tax.\nRegulations on Foreign Exchange\nForeign Currency Exchange\nPursuant to the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, as amended, and various regulations issued by SAFE and other relevant PRC government\nauthorities, Renminbi is freely convertible to the extent of current account items, such as trade related receipts and payments, interest and dividends.\nCapital account items, such as direct equity investments, loans and repatriation of investment, unless expressly exempted by laws and regulations, still\nrequire prior approval from SAFE or its provincial branch for conversion of Renminbi into a foreign currency, such as U.S. dollars, and remittance of the\nforeign currency outside of the PRC. Payments for transactions that take place within the PRC must be made in Renminbi. Foreign currency revenues\nreceived by PRC companies may be repatriated into China or retained outside of China in accordance with requirements and terms specified by SAFE.\nDividend Distribution\nWholly foreign-owned enterprises and Sino-foreign equity joint ventures in the PRC may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, as\ndetermined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Additionally, these FIEs may not pay dividends unless they set aside at least 10\npercent of their respective accumulated profits after tax each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds, until such time as the accumulative amount of such\nfund reaches 50 percent of the enterprise’s registered capital. In addition, these companies also may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on\nPRC accounting standards to employee welfare and bonus funds at their discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.\n33\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Exchange Registration of Overseas Investment by PRC Residents\nCircular 37, issued by SAFE and effective on July 4, 2014, regulates foreign exchange matters in relation to the use of SPVs by PRC residents or\nentities to seek offshore investment and financing and conduct round trip investment in China. Under Circular 37, a SPV refers to an offshore entity\nestablished or controlled, directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment,\nusing legitimate domestic or offshore assets or interests, while “round trip investment” refers to the direct investment in China by PRC residents or entities\nthrough SPVs, namely, establishing FIEs to obtain the ownership, control rights and management rights. Circular 37 requires that, before making\ncontribution into a SPV, PRC residents or entities are required to complete foreign exchange registration with the SAFE or its local branch. SAFE Circular\n37 further provides that option or share-based incentive tool holders of a non-listed SPV can exercise the options or share incentive tools to become a\nshareholder of such non-listed SPV, subject to registration with SAFE or its local branch.\nPRC residents or entities who have contributed legitimate domestic or offshore interests or assets to SPVs but have yet to obtain SAFE registration\nbefore the implementation of the Circular 37 shall register their ownership interests or control in such SPVs with SAFE or its local branch. An amendment\nto the registration is required if there is a material change in the registered SPV, such as any change of basic information (including change of such PRC\n“resident’s name” and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amounts, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. Failure to\ncomply with the registration procedures set forth in Circular 37, or making misrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers of a FIE that is established\nthrough round-trip investment, may result in restrictions on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant FIEs, including payment of dividends and other\ndistributions, such as proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation, to its offshore parent or affiliate, and the capital inflow from the\noffshore parent, and may also subject relevant PRC residents or entities to penalties under PRC foreign exchange administration regulations. On February\n13, 2015, SAFE further promulgated the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct\nInvestment, or SAFE Circular 13, which took effect on June 1, 2015. This SAFE Circular 13 has amended SAFE Circular 37 by requiring PRC residents or\nentities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity\nestablished for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nOn March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated Circular 19, which came into effect on June 1, 2015. According to Circular 19, the foreign exchange\ncapital of FIEs shall be subject to the Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement. The Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement refers to the foreign\nexchange capital in the capital account of a FIE for which the rights and interests of monetary contribution has been confirmed by the local foreign\nexchange bureau (or the book-entry registration of monetary contribution by the banks) can be settled at the banks based on the actual operational needs of\nthe FIE. The proportion of Discretional Foreign Exchange Settlement of the foreign exchange capital of a FIE is temporarily determined to be 100%. The\nRenminbi converted from the foreign exchange capital will be kept in a designated account and if a FIE needs to make further payment from such account,\nit still needs to provide supporting documents and go through the review process with the banks.\nSAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or Circular 16,\non June 9, 2016, which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts\nfrom foreign currency to Renminbi on a discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital\naccount items (including foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular\n16 reiterates the principle that Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for\npurposes beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, while such converted Renminbi shall not be provided as loans to its non-\naffiliated entities. As Circular 16 is newly issued and SAFE has not provided detailed guidelines with respect to its interpretation or implementations, it is\nuncertain how these rules will be interpreted and implemented.\nRegulations on loans to and direct investment in the PRC entities by offshore holding companies\nAccording to the Implementation Rules for the Provisional Regulations on Statistics and Supervision of Foreign Debt promulgated by SAFE on\nSeptember 24, 1997 and the Interim Provisions on the Management of Foreign Debts promulgated by SAFE, the NDRC and the MOF and effective from\nMarch 1, 2003, loans by foreign companies to their subsidiaries in China, which accordingly are FIEs, are considered foreign debt, and such loans must be\nregistered with the local branches of the SAFE. Under the provisions, the total amount of accumulated medium-term and long-term foreign debt and the\nbalance of short-term debt borrowed by a FIE is limited to the difference between the total investment and the registered capital of the foreign- invested\nenterprise.\n34\nOn January 12, 2017, the People’s Bank of China promulgated the Circular of the People’s Bank of China on Matters relating to the Macro-prudential\nManagement of Comprehensive Cross-border Financing, or PBOC Circular 9, which took effect on the same date. The PBOC Circular 9 established a\ncapital or net assets-based constraint mechanism for cross-border financing. Under such mechanism, a company may carry out cross-border financing in\nRenminbi or foreign currencies at their own discretion. The total cross-border financing of a company shall be calculated using a risk-weighted approach\nand shall not exceed an upper limit. The upper limit is calculated as capital or assets multiplied by a cross-border financing leverage ratio and multiplied by\na macro-prudential regulation parameter.\nIn addition, according to PBOC Circular 9, as of the date of the promulgation of PBOC Circular 9, a transition period of one year is set for foreign-\ninvested enterprises and during such transition period, FIEs may apply either the current cross-border financing management mode, namely the mode\nprovided by Implementation Rules for the Provisional Regulations on Statistics and Supervision of Foreign Debt and the Interim Provisions on the\nManagement of Foreign Debts, or the mode in this PBOC Circular 9 at its sole discretion. After the end of the transition period, the cross-border financing\nmanagement mode for FIEs will be determined by the People’s Bank of China and SAFE after assessment based on the overall implementation of this\nPBOC Circular 9.\nAccording to applicable PRC regulations on FIEs, capital contributions from a foreign holding company to its PRC subsidiaries, which are considered\nFIEs, may only be made when approval by or registration with the MOFCOM or its local counterpart is obtained.\nRegulations Relating to Foreign Investment\nThe Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment\nInvestment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are governed by the Guidance Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment, or the Catalogue,\nwhich was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the MOFCOM and the NDRC. The latest version of the Catalogue became effective from\nJuly 28, 2017, which was partially abolished by Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (Edition 2018). The\nCatalogue divides industries into three categories in terms of foreign investment: “encouraged”, “restricted” and “prohibited.” The purpose of the\nCatalogue is to direct foreign investment into certain priority industry sectors while restricting or prohibiting investment in other sectors. If the investment\nfalls within the “encouraged” category, foreign investment can be conducted through the establishment of a WFOE. If the investment falls within the\n“restricted” category, foreign investment may be conducted through the establishment of a WFOE if certain requirements are met or in some cases must be\nconducted through the establishment of a joint venture enterprise, with varying minimum shareholdings for the Chinese party, depending on the particular\nindustry. If the investment falls within the “prohibited” category, foreign investment of any kind is not allowed. Any investment that occurs within an\nindustry not falling into any of three categories is classified as a permitted industry for foreign investment.\nOn June 28, 2018, the National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Commerce promulgated the Special Administrative Measures\n(Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (Edition 2018), which took effect on July 28, 2018. The Special Administrative Measures (Negative List)\nfor Foreign Investment Access specified in the Catalogue of Industries for Foreign Investment (Revision 2017) issued by the National Development and\nReform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce on June 28, 2017 are repealed simultaneously, while the Catalogue is still valid.\nThe Foreign Investment Law\nOn March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress approved the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020 and replaced three\nexisting laws on foreign investments in China, namely, the PRC Equity Joint Venture Law, the PRC Cooperative Joint Venture Law and the Wholly\nForeign-owned Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected\nPRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify\nthe corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic invested enterprises in China. The Foreign Investment Law establishes the basic framework\nfor the access to, and the promotion, protection and administration of foreign investments in view of investment protection and fair competition.\nAccording to the Foreign Investment Law, “foreign investment” refers to investment activities directly or indirectly conducted by one or more natural\npersons, business entities, or otherwise organizations of a foreign country (collectively referred to as “foreign investor”) within China, and the investment\nactivities include the following situations: (i) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, establishes a foreign-invested enterprise\nwithin China; (ii) a foreign investor acquires stock shares, equity shares, shares in assets, or other like rights and interests of an enterprise within China;\n(iii) a foreign investor, individually or collectively with other investors, invests in a new project within China; and (iv) investments in other means as\nprovided by laws, administrative regulations, or the State Council.\nAccording to the Foreign Investment Law, the State Council will publish or approve to publish the “negative list” for special administrative measures\nconcerning foreign investment. The Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, or FIEs, except for those FIEs that\noperate in industries deemed to be either “restricted” or “prohibited” in the “negative list”. Because the “negative list” has yet to be published, it is unclear\nwhether it will differ from the current Special Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List). The Foreign Investment\nLaw provides that FIEs operating in foreign restricted or prohibited industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC\ngovernmental authorities. If a foreign investor is found to invest in any prohibited industry in the “negative list”, such foreign investor may be required to,\namong other aspects, cease its investment activities, dispose of its equity interests or assets within a prescribed time limit and have its income confiscated.\nIf the investment activity of a foreign investor is in breach of any special administrative measure for restrictive access provided for in the “negative list”,\nthe relevant competent department shall order the foreign investor to make corrections and take necessary measures to meet the requirements of the special\nadministrative measure for restrictive access.\n35\nBesides, the PRC government will establish a foreign investment information reporting system, according to which foreign investors or foreign-\ninvested enterprises shall submit investment information to the competent department for commerce concerned through the enterprise registration system\nand the enterprise credit information publicity system, and a security review system under which the security review shall be conducted for foreign\ninvestment affecting or likely affecting the state security.\nFurthermore, the Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign invested enterprises established according to the existing laws regulating foreign\ninvestment may maintain their structure and corporate governance within five years after the implementing of the Foreign Investment Law.\nIn addition, the Foreign Investment Law also provides several protective rules and principles for foreign investors and their investments in the PRC,\nincluding, among others, that a foreign investor may freely transfer into or out of China, in Renminbi or a foreign currency, its contributions, profits, capital\ngains, income from disposition of assets, royalties of intellectual property rights, indemnity or compensation lawfully acquired, and income from\nliquidation, among others, within China; local governments shall abide by their commitments to the foreign investors; governments at all levels and their\ndepartments shall enact local normative documents concerning foreign investment in compliance with laws and regulations and shall not impair legitimate\nrights and interests, impose additional obligations onto FIEs, set market access restrictions and exit conditions, or intervene with the normal production and\noperation activities of FIEs; except for special circumstances, in which case statutory procedures shall be followed and fair and reasonable compensation\nshall be made in a timely manner, expropriation or requisition of the investment of foreign investors is prohibited; and mandatory technology transfer is\nprohibited.\nCompany Law\nPursuant to the PRC Company Law, promulgated by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on December, 29 1993, effective as of\nJuly 1, 1994, and as revised on December 25, 1999, August 28, 2004, October 27, 2005, December 28, 2013 and October 26, 2018, the establishment,\noperation and management of corporate entities in the PRC are governed by the PRC Company Law. The PRC Company Law defines two types of\ncompanies: limited liability companies and limited stock companies.\nOur PRC operating subsidiary is a limited liability company. Unless otherwise stipulated in the related laws on foreign investment, foreign invested\ncompanies are also required to comply with the provisions of the PRC Company Law.\nLaws and Regulations on the Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests\nBusiness operators in the business of supplying and selling manufactured goods or services to consumers, shall comply with the Law of the PRC on\nthe Protection of Consumer Rights and Interests (the “Consumer Rights Protection Law”) promulgated by the SCNPC on October 31, 1993, and effective\nas of January 1, 1994, and revised on August 27, 2009 and October 25, 2013.\nAccording to the Consumer Rights Protection Law, business operators must ensure that the goods or services provided by them meet the requirements\nfor safeguarding personal and property safety. For goods and services that may endanger personal and property safety, consumers should be provided with a\ntrue description and an explicit warning, as well as a description and indication of the proper way to use the goods or accept the services and the methods of\npreventing the occurrence of a hazard. If the goods or services provided by the business operators cause personal injuries to consumers or third parties, the\nbusiness operators shall compensate the injured parties for their losses.\nContract Law\nAll of our contracts are subject to the PRC contract law. Under PRC contract law, a natural person, legal person or other legally established\norganization shall have full capacity of civil right and civil conduct while entering into a contact. Except as otherwise required by other laws and\nregulations, the formation, validity, performance, modification, assignment, termination, and liability for breach of a contract are stipulated by PRC\ncontract law. A contracting party who failed to perform or failed to fulfill its contractual obligation shall bear the responsibility of a continued duty to\nperform or to provide remedies and compensation as provided by PRC laws.\nProduct Quality Law\nPursuant to Product Quality Law of the PRC, promulgated on September 1, 1993 and amended in 2000, 2009 and 2018 respectively, producing or\nselling products that do not meet the standards or requirements for safeguarding human health or that constitute unreasonable threats to the safety of human\nlife or property is prohibited. Where a defective product causes physical injury to a person or damage to his/her property, the injured party may claim\ncompensation against the manufacturer or the distributor of such product.\nWhere any person produces or sells products that do not comply with the relevant national or industrial standards for safeguarding human health or\nconstitute unreasonable threats to the safety of human life or property, the relevant authority will order the specific manufacturer or distributor to suspend\nthe production or sale of defective products, confiscate the products produced or for sale, and impose a fine in an amount of up to three times the value of\nthe defective products. Where illegal earnings were made or were involved, the relevant earnings will be confiscated accordingly. If the breach of\nregulation is serious, the business license of the relevant manufacturer and distributor may be revoked. If the relevant activities constitute a crime, the\noffender may be prosecuted.\n36\nPRC Laws and Regulations Relating to Advertising Business\nThe State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or SAI, is the primary governmental authority regulating advertising activities in China. The\nAdvertisement Law of the PRC, which was most recently amended on October 26, 2018, the Administrative Regulations for Advertising, effective as of\nDecember 1, 1987, and the Administrative Provisions on Registration of Publishing of Advertisements, effective as of December 1, 2016 are the relevant\nregulations that apply to advertising businesses.\nAccording to the above laws, regulations and rules, a company engaged in advertising activities must obtain, from the SAIC or its local branches, a\nbusiness license that specifically includes operating an advertising business in its business scope.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated\nfinancial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 20-F. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements\nbased upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-\nlooking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors” or in other parts of this\nannual report on Form 20-F.\nA. Operating results\nOverview\nWe are a producer, developer and operator of AR interactive entertainment games and toys in China, including interactive educational materials,\nmobile games, and toys with mobile game features. Our interactive entertainment platform creates unique user experiences by connecting physical items to\nmobile devices, which creates a rich visual and interactive environment for users through the integration of real objects and virtual scenery. Distinguished\nby our proprietary technology, we aim to create an engaging, interactive and immersive community for our users.\nWe have grown rapidly since our inception. We generate revenues primarily from sales of our interactive toys, specifically our animation and game\nseries, and mobile games. Our total revenues increased by $5,302,951, or 28.6%, to $23,834,129 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to\n$18,531,178 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our total revenues increased by $4,386,284, or 31.0%, to $18,531,178 for the year ended December\n31, 2018 as compared to $14,144,894 for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn an effort to capture a substantive share of the AR interactive toy market in China, we have increased our investment in the research and\ndevelopment of our AR interactive toys and games. Investment in research and development internally in the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and\n2017 were $1,031,204, $286,842 and $355,730, respectively. We have collaborated with external developers in the AR interactive toys and games industry.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we prepaid approximately $4.4 million and $3.4 million to such developers for the development of more advanced\ntechnology for our AR interactive toys and games.\n41\nKey Factors that Affect Operating Results\nInvestment in technology and talent\nWe believe the key to success in the AR interactive toy market is research and development. We release new mobile applications annually, and intend\nto continue doing so, in an effort to extend the life cycle of our products. The advancement of our technology is critical as it enables us to retain and attract\nusers. We must continue to innovate, develop and produce technologies in order to keep pace with the growth of our business and the industry. Therefore,\nwe invest substantially in the research and development of AR interactive technologies. Our current research and development efforts are primarily focused\non further advancement of the technology used in our products, including photosensitive induction technology, gesture-sensor technology, infrared\ninduction technology and AR identification technology.\nOur ability to build our brand and expand our sales distribution channel\nOur distribution channels include domestic distributors, e-commerce platforms, supermarkets and export distributors. 100% of our products sold in\n2019 were sold domestically in China, and 98.4% of those products sold in China were generated from Chinese distributors. We are in the process of\nexpanding our e-commerce sales team, and we are transitioning from single, offline promotional activities to diversified, online interactive marketing and\ndigital marketing. We intend to increase our branding and advertising activities via online communities, social media and television. Our revenue growth\nwill be affected by our ability to effectively execute our shifting marketing strategies and expand our sales distribution channel through e-commence.\nOur ability to expand our portfolio of products and business\nWe intend to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments in selective technologies and businesses that will enhance our technology capabilities,\nexpand our offerings and increase our market penetration. We believe our strategic acquisition and investment strategy is critical for us to accelerate our\ngrowth and strengthen our competitive position. Our ability to identify and execute strategic acquisitions and investments will have an effect on our\noperating results.\nPRC economy\nAlthough the PRC economy has grown in recent years, the pace of growth has slowed, and growth rates may continue to decline. According to the\nPRC National Bureau of Statistics of China, the annual rate of growth in the PRC declined from 7.6% in 2014, to 7.0% in 2015, 6.8% in 2016, 6.9% in\n2017, 6.8% in 2018 and 6.1% in 2019. A further slowdown in overall economic growth, an economic downturn, a recession or other adverse economic\ndevelopment in the PRC may materially reduce the purchasing power of Chinese consumers and thus lead to a decrease in the demand for our products.\nSuch a decrease in demand may have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nImpact of Foreign Currency Fluctuation\nSee “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Fluctuations in exchange rates could have a material\nand adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.” and “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market\nRisk-Foreign Exchange Risk.”\nRecent Developments\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19, which originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019, is a fluid and challenging situation facing all industries.

The increase in gross profit is primarily due to the significant increase in revenues as a result of increased sales of the interactive toys\n– game series business line. This series of products generally has a higher gross profit percentage as compared to our other products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our overall gross profit percentage was 68.4% and 67.0%, respectively. The increase in gross profit\npercentage was primarily due to the increase of revenues from our interactive toys – game series, which contributed 88.7% of our total revenues with a\ngross profit percentage of 66.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 where our interactive toys –\ngame series contributed 91.2% of our total revenues.

The increase of gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to the increase of proportion of e-commerce channel sales in the sales\nof interactive toys – animation series.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by $2.71 million or 66.1% from $4.11 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.82 million for the year\nended December 31, 2019.

The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the significant increase in revenues as a result of increased sales of the interactive\ntoys — game series business line. This series of products generally has a higher gross profit percentage as compared to our other products.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, our overall gross profit percentage was 67.0% and 62.5%, respectively. The increase in gross profit\npercentage was primarily due to the increase of revenues from our interactive toys — game series, which contributed 91.2% of our total revenues with a\ngross profit percentage of 66.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, where our interactive toys —\ngame series contributed 91.6% of our total revenues with a gross profit percentage of 64.3%.\nGross profit percentage for our interactive toys — game series was 66.8% and 64.3% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe increase of gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to the 2018 reduction of the VAT rate from 17% to 16%. Because our customers are paying\nthe same price for our products as they did when the higher VAT rate was included in the price, our gross profit percentage increased by 2.5%.\nGross profit percentage for our interactive toys — animation series was 27.5% and 38.4% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017,\nrespectively. The decrease of gross profit percentage was mainly attributable to a certain export tax credit that we normally receive in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017, but did not get approved and refunded for in the year ended December 31, 2018, as the majority of our interactive toys — animation\nseries sales are mainly exported outside of the PRC market, thus driving down gross profit percentage during the year ended December 31, 2018 as\ncompared to the same period in 2017 by 10.9%.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased by $1.2 million, or 41.5%, from $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $4.1 million during the\nyear ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly attributable to the $0.1 million decrease in selling expenses, the $1.1 million increase in general\nand administrative, or G&A, expenses, and the $69,000 decrease in research and development, or R&D, expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 as\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe $0.1 million increase in selling expenses was primarily attributable to (i) a $0.4 million increase in salary and benefit expenses in our sales\ndepartment, as we have increased our sales personnel to expand our marketing and promotional activities. This increase is offset by (i) the $0.2 million\ndecrease in advertising publication fees and (ii) the $0.1 million decrease in product packaging fees.\nThe $1.1 million increase in G&A expenses was primarily attributable to (i) the $0.4 million increase in professional fees as we had incurred fees in\nconnection with this offering, (ii) the $0.4 million increase in bad debt allowance, (iii) the $0.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses\nand (iv) the $0.1 million increase in other various miscellaneous G&A expenses, such as expenses for meals and entertainment, automobile, travel,\nrecruitment and a guarantee fee due to the increase of our operating needs.\nThe $69,000 decrease in R&D expenses was mainly attributable to management efforts in efficiency and cost control of our R&D expenses. We remain\ncommitted to the innovation, development and production of technologies in order to keep pace with the growth of our business and the industry. In\naddition to our existing internal R&D team, we began outsourcing our external R&D teams to develop cutting-edge technologies. As of December 31,\n2018, we prepaid approximately $3.4 million to such developers for the development of more advanced technology for our AR interactive toys and games.\nOther income, net\nTotal other income, net increased by $72,000, or 52.8%, from $136,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 to $207,000 during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to (i) the $58,000 increase in interest income as we invested more short-term investments of\ncertificate deposits and (ii) the $41,000 decrease in interest expense as we repaid certain of our short-term bank loans. This increase is offset by the $26,000\ndecrease in other income.\nIncome tax expense\nOur income tax expense amounted to $605,000 and $955,000 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This decrease of\n$350,000 is a result of a favorable income tax rate being granted to Blue Hat Pingxiang, which we are applying using 10% of gross revenue to apply its\n25% tax rate as compared to the standard income tax rate of 25%.\nNet income\nOur net income increased by $2.8 million, or 54.5%, to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, from $5.1 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017. Such change was the result of the combination of the changes as discussed above.\n48\nB.

Research and development, patents and licenses, etc.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe the key to success in the AR interactive toy market is research and development. As such, we have invested, and intend to continue to\ninvest, substantial resources in the research and development of AR interactive technologies. We maintain two high quality research and development\nteams responsible for hardware and software design. Both research and development teams consist of 45 AR specialists, including many top talented\nindividuals in the AR field, and are led by individuals with experience from China’s prominent internet game developers and operators. Approximately 22\nmembers of our research and development team are based in Xiamen, mainly focusing on the research and development of electronic toys, AR games and\nproducts for licensing. Approximately 23 members of our research and development team are based at our Fuzhou branch, focusing on mobile games and\nAR game research and development. We also cooperate with several third party research and development teams. For example, we are partnering with\nFujian Normal University Embedded Development Laboratory on the development of our Qi Platform. For example, we provide the funding for the project\nwith Fujian Normal University, and in turn, we are able to use the facilities of Fujian Normal University and retain the intellectual property developed\nduring the project.\nOur research and development process for a new or enhanced product typically starts with our research and development team brainstorming with our\nmarketing and sales team to create new ideas and designs containing popular elements. Our marketing and sales team will gather information about the\nmarket demand from distributors through exhibitions that they attend. Our marketing and sales team and our research and development team will hold\nmeetings to discuss and summarize the information and determine which potential products they expect to be popular among existing and new customers.\nOur research and development team will then determine the feasibility of the proposed new products. From time to time, our research and development\nteam will generate ideas for new products from a technological perspective and communicate such ideas with the marketing and sales team. These ideas are\nthen presented to our senior management team for approval. If the proposal is approved by senior management, the company will officially establish the\nproject of developing the new product.\nOur standard research and development cycle per product is approximately eight months. Initial product development usually takes two to three\nmonths in order to produce quality product samples. For product samples put into production, it usually takes an additional four to eight months for further\ndevelopment and design.\nOur research and development department is currently focusing on the further advancement of the technology used in our products, including\nphotosensitive induction technology, gesture-sensor technology, infrared induction technology and AR identification technology. We have invested, and\nwill continue to invest, substantial resources in our research and development activities, including technology and game development.\nOur patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights serve to distinguish our products, protect our products from infringement,\nand contribute to our competitive advantages. To secure the value of our technology and developments, we are aggressive in pursuing a combination of\npatent, trademark and copyright protection for our proprietary technologies.

Our authorized share capital is 50,000,000 ordinary shares with a par value of $0.001 per ordinary share.\nWe have included summaries of material provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association insofar as they relate to the\nmaterial terms of our share capital. The summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to our amended and\nrestated memorandum and articles of association, which is filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this annual report.\nOrdinary Shares\nAll of our outstanding ordinary shares are fully paid and non-assessable.\nIssuance of Shares and Changes to Capital\nOur board of directors has general and unconditional authority to allot, grant options over, offer or otherwise deal with or dispose of any unissued\nshares in our capital without the approval of our shareholders (whether forming part of the original or any increased share capital), either at a premium or at\npar, with or without preferred, deferred or other special rights or restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise and to\nsuch persons, on such terms and conditions, and at such times as the directors may decide, but so that no share shall be issued at a discount, except in\naccordance with the provisions of the Companies Law. We will not issue bearer shares.\nWe may, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the SEC and Nasdaq,\nfrom time to time by shareholders resolution passed by a simple majority of the voting rights entitled to vote at a general meeting: increase our capital by\nsuch sum, to be divided into shares of such amounts, as the relevant resolution shall prescribe; consolidate and divide all or any of our share capital into\nshares of larger amount than our existing shares; convert all or any of its paid up shares into stock and reconvert that stock into paid up shares of any\ndenomination; sub-divide our existing shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amounts than is fixed pursuant to our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association; and cancel any shares which at the date of the passing of the resolution have not been taken or agreed to be taken\nby any person, and diminish the amount of our share capital by the amount of the shares so cancelled.\nWe may also, subject to the provisions of the Companies Law, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, the SEC and\nNasdaq: issue shares on terms that they are to be redeemed or are liable to be redeemed; purchase our own shares (including any redeemable shares); and\nmake a payment in respect of the redemption or purchase of our own shares in any manner authorized by the Companies Law, including out of our capital.\nDividends\nSubject to the Companies Law, our shareholders may, by resolution passed by a simple majority of the voting rights entitled to vote at the general\nmeeting, declare dividends (including interim dividends) to be paid to our shareholders but no dividend shall be declared in excess of the amount\nrecommended by our board of directors. Dividends may be declared and paid out of funds lawfully available to us. Except as otherwise provided by the\nrights attached to shares, all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on which the dividend is paid. All\ndividends shall be paid in proportion to the number of ordinary shares a shareholder holds during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which\nthe dividend is paid; but, if any share is issued on terms providing that it shall rank for dividend as from a particular date, that share shall rank for dividend\naccordingly. Our board of directors may also declare and pay dividends out of the share premium account or any other fund or account which can be\nauthorized for this purpose in accordance with the Companies Law.\nIn addition, our board of directors may resolve to capitalize any undivided profits not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not\nthey are available for distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of the share premium account or capital redemption reserve; appropriate the sum\nresolved to be capitalized to the shareholders who would have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions and\napply such sum on their behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts, if any, for the time being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or in\npaying up in full unissued shares or debentures of a nominal amount equal to such sum, and allot the shares or debentures credited as fully paid to those\nshareholders, or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in one way and partly in the other; resolve that any shares so allotted to any shareholder\nin respect of a holding by him/her of any partly-paid shares rank for dividend, so long as such shares remain partly paid, only to the extent that such partly\npaid shares rank for dividend; make such provision by the issue of fractional certificates or by payment in cash or otherwise as they determine in the case of\nshares or debentures becoming distributable in fractions; and authorize any person to enter on behalf of all our shareholders concerned in an agreement\nwith us providing for the allotment of them respectively, credited as fully paid, of any shares or debentures to which they may be entitled upon such\ncapitalization, any agreement made under such authority being binding on all such shareholders.\n60\nVoting and Meetings\nAs a condition of admission to a shareholders’ meeting, a shareholder must be duly registered as our shareholder at the applicable record date for that\nmeeting and all calls or installments then payable by such shareholder to us in respect of our ordinary shares must have been paid. Subject to any special\nrights or restrictions as to voting then attached to any shares, at any general meeting every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy (or, in the case\nof a shareholder being a corporation, by its duly authorized representative not being himself or herself a shareholder entitled to vote) shall have one vote\nper share.\nAs a Cayman Islands exempted company, we are not obliged by the Companies Law to call annual general meetings; however, our amended and\nrestated memorandum and articles of association provide that in each year we will hold an annual general meeting of shareholders at a time determined by\nour board of directors. Also, we may, but are not required to (unless required by the Law), in each year hold any other extraordinary general meeting.\nThe Companies Law of the Cayman Islands provides shareholders with only limited rights to requisition a general meeting, and does not provide\nshareholders with any right to put any proposal before a general meeting. However, these rights may be provided in a company’s articles of association.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that upon the requisition of shareholders representing not less than two-thirds\nof the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings, our board will convene an extraordinary general meeting and put the resolutions so requisitioned to\na vote at such meeting. However, shareholders may propose only ordinary resolutions to be put to a vote at such meeting and shall have no right to propose\nresolutions with respect to the election, appointment or removal of directors or with respect to the size of the board. Our amended and restated\nmemorandum and articles of association provide no other right to put any proposals before annual general meetings or extraordinary general meetings.\nSubject to regulatory requirements, our annual general meeting and any extraordinary general meetings must be called by not less than ten (10) clear days’\nnotice prior to the relevant shareholders meeting and convened by a notice discussed below. Alternatively, upon the prior consent of all holders entitled to\nattend and vote (with regards to an annual general meeting), and the holders of 95% in par value of the shares entitled to attend and vote (with regard to an\nextraordinary general meeting), that meeting may be convened by a shorter notice and in a manner deemed appropriate by those holders.\nWe will give notice of each general meeting of shareholders by publication on our website and in any other manner that we may be required to follow\nin order to comply with Cayman Islands law, Nasdaq and SEC requirements. The holders of registered shares may be convened for a shareholders’ meeting\nby means of letters sent to the addresses of those shareholders as registered in our shareholders’ register, or, subject to certain statutory requirements, by\nelectronic means. We will observe the statutory minimum convening notice period for a general meeting of shareholders.\nA quorum for a general meeting consists of any one or more persons holding or representing by proxy not less than one-third of our issued voting\nshares entitled to vote upon the business to be transacted.\nA resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a poll. An ordinary resolution to be passed by the shareholders requires the affirmative\nvote of a simple majority of the votes cast by, or on behalf of, the shareholders entitled to vote present in person or by proxy and voting at the meeting. A\nspecial resolution requires the affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or\nby proxy at a general meeting (except for certain matters described below which require an affirmative vote of two-thirds). Both ordinary resolutions and\nspecial resolutions may also be passed by a unanimous written resolution signed by all the shareholders of our company, as permitted by the Companies\nLaw and our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.\nOur amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that the affirmative vote of no less than two-thirds of votes cast by the\nshareholders entitled to vote who are present in person or by proxy at a general meeting shall be required to approve any amendments to any provisions of\nour amended and restated memorandum and articles of association that relate to or have an impact upon the procedures regarding the election, appointment,\nremoval of directors and size of the board.\n61\nTransfers of Shares\nSubject to any applicable restrictions set forth in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, any of our shareholders may\ntransfer all or a portion of their ordinary shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual or common form or in the form prescribed by Nasdaq or in any\nother form which our board of directors may approve. Our board of directors may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register a transfer of any common\nshare that is not a fully paid up share to a person of whom it does not approve, or any common share issued under any share incentive scheme for\nemployees upon which a restriction on transfer imposed thereby still subsists, and it may also, without prejudice to the foregoing generality, refuse to\nregister a transfer of any common share to more than four joint holders or a transfer of any share that is not a fully paid up share on which we have a lien.\nOur board of directors may also decline to register any transfer of any registered common share unless: a fee of such maximum sum as Nasdaq may\ndetermine to be payable or such lesser sum as the board of directors may from time to time require is paid to us in respect thereof; the instrument of transfer\nis in respect of only one class of shares; the ordinary shares transferred are fully paid and free of any lien; the instrument of transfer is lodged at the\nregistered office or such other place (i.e., our transfer agent) at which the register of shareholders is kept, accompanied by any relevant share certificate(s)\nand/or such other evidence as the board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; and if applicable, the\ninstrument of transfer is duly and properly stamped.\nIf our board of directors refuse to register a transfer, they are required, within one month after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged,\nto send to each of the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal.\nLiquidation\nSubject to any special rights, privileges or restrictions as to the distribution of available surplus assets on liquidation applicable to any class or classes\nof shares (1) if we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among our shareholders are more than sufficient to repay the whole of the capital\npaid up at the commencement of the winding up, the excess shall be distributed pari passu among our shareholders in proportion to the amount paid up at\nthe commencement of the winding up on the shares held by them, respectively, and (2) if we are wound up and the assets available for distribution among\nour shareholders as such are insufficient to repay the whole of the paid-up capital, those assets shall be distributed so that, as nearly as may be, the losses\nshall be borne by our shareholders in proportion to the capital paid up, or which ought to have been paid up, at the commencement of the winding up on the\nshares held by them, respectively.\nIf we are wound up, the liquidator may with the sanction of a special resolution and any other sanction required by the Companies Law, divide among\nour shareholders in specie the whole or any part of our assets and may, for such purpose, value any assets and determine how such division shall be carried\nout as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders. The liquidator may also, with the sanction of a special resolution, vest any part of these\nassets in trustees upon such trusts for the benefit of our shareholders as the liquidator shall think fit, but so that no shareholder will be compelled to accept\nany assets, shares or other securities upon which there is a liability.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions\nSome provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our\ncompany or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in\none or more series and to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preferred shares without any further vote or action by\nour shareholders.\nInspection of Books and Records\nHolders of ordinary shares will have no general right under Cayman Islands law to inspect or obtain copies of our list of shareholders or our corporate\nrecords. However, our board of directors may determine from time to time whether our accounting records and books shall be open to the inspection of our\nshareholders not members of our board of directors. Notwithstanding the above, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide\nour shareholders with the right to receive annual audited financial statements. Such right to receive annual audited financial statements may be satisfied by\nfiling such annual reports as we are required to file with the SEC.\nRegister of Shareholders\nUnder Cayman Islands law, we must keep a register of shareholders that includes: the names and addresses of the shareholders, a statement of the\nshares held by each member, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid, on the shares of each member; the date on which the name of any\nperson was entered on the register as a member; and the date on which any person ceased to be a member.\n62\nExempted Company\nWe are an exempted company with limited liability under the Companies Law. The Companies Law distinguishes between ordinary resident\ncompanies and exempted companies. Any company that is registered in the Cayman Islands but conducts business mainly outside of the Cayman Islands\nmay apply to be registered as an exempted company. An exempted company:\n● does not have to file an annual return of its shareholders with the Registrar of Companies;\n● is not required to open its register of members for inspection;\n● does not have to hold an annual general meeting;\n● may issue shares with no par value;\n● may obtain an undertaking against the imposition of any future taxation;\n● may register by way of continuation in another jurisdiction and be deregistered in the Cayman Islands;\n● may register as a limited duration company; and\n● may register as a segregated portfolio company.\n“Limited liability” means that the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount unpaid by the shareholder on the shares of the company (except\nin exceptional circumstances, such as involving fraud, the establishment of an agency relationship or an illegal or improper purpose or other circumstances\nin which a court may be prepared to pierce or lift the corporate veil).\nPreferred Shares\nOur board of directors is empowered to designate and issue from time to time one or more classes or series of preferred shares and to fix and determine\nthe relative rights, preferences, designations, qualifications, privileges, options, conversion rights, limitations and other special or relative rights of each\nsuch class or series so authorized. Such action could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares or could have\nthe effect of discouraging any attempt by a person or group to obtain control of us.\nC. Material Contracts\nWe have not entered into any material contracts other than in the ordinary course of business and other than those described in “Item 4. Information on\nthe Company” or elsewhere in this annual report on Form 20-F.\nD. Exchange Controls\nSee “Item 4. Information on the Company—B. Business Overview—Regulation—Regulations Relating to Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend\nDistribution.”\nE. Taxation\nThe following summary of the material Cayman Islands, PRC and U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares is\nbased upon laws and relevant interpretations thereof in effect as of the date of this annual report, all of which are subject to change. This summary does not\ndeal with all possible tax consequences relating to an investment in our ordinary shares, such as the tax consequences under U.S. state and local tax laws or\nunder the tax laws of jurisdictions other than the Cayman Islands, the People’s Republic of China and the United States.\n63\nMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for U.S. Holders\nThe following discussion describes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences relating to the ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares\nby U.S. Holders (as defined below). This discussion applies to U.S. Holders that purchase our ordinary shares and hold such ordinary shares as capital\nassets. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and\nadministrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.\nThis discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to specific U.S. Holders in light of their particular\ncircumstances or to U.S. Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as certain financial institutions, insurance companies,\ndealers or traders in securities or other persons that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or\ngovernmental organizations, retirement plans, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, grantor trusts, brokers, dealers or traders in\nsecurities, commodities, currencies or notional principal contracts, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, persons who hold our\nordinary shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction,” “synthetic security” or integrated investment, persons that have a “functional\ncurrency” other than the U.S. dollar, persons that own directly, indirectly or through attribution 10% or more of the voting power of our ordinary shares,\ncorporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, partnerships and other pass-through entities, and investors in such pass-through\nentities). This discussion does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax consequences or any U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax\nconsequences.\nAs used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of our ordinary shares who is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (1) an\nindividual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation (or entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created\nor organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S.\nfederal income tax regardless of its source or (4) a trust (x) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision\nover its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (y) that has elected under\napplicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds our ordinary shares, the U.S. federal income tax consequences relating\nto an investment in such ordinary shares will depend in part upon the status and activities of such entity and the particular partner. Any such entity should\nconsult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to it and its partners of the purchase, ownership and disposition\nof our ordinary shares.\nPersons considering an investment in our ordinary shares should consult their own tax advisors as to the particular tax consequences applicable to them\nrelating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares including the applicability of U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and non-U.S.\ntax laws.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company Consequences\nIn general, a corporation organized outside the United States will be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which either (1) at least 75% of its gross\nincome is “passive income” (the “PFIC income test”), or (2) on average at least 50% of its assets, determined on a quarterly basis, are assets that produce\npassive income or are held for the production of passive income (the “PFIC asset test”). Passive income for this purpose generally includes, among other\nthings, dividends, interest, royalties, rents, and gains from the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income. Assets that produce or are held\nfor the production of passive income generally include cash, even if held as working capital or raised in a public offering, marketable securities, and other\nassets that may produce passive income. Generally, in determining whether a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC, a proportionate share of the income and\nassets of each corporation in which it owns, directly or indirectly, at least a 25% interest (by value) is taken into account.\n64\nAlthough PFIC status is determined on an annual basis and generally cannot be determined until the end of a taxable year, based on the nature of our\ncurrent and expected income and the current and expected value and composition of our assets, we do not presently expect to be a PFIC for our current\ntaxable year or the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance given in this regard because the determination of whether we are or will become\na PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part, upon the composition of our income and assets. In addition, there can be no\nassurance that the IRS will agree with our conclusion or that the IRS would not successfully challenge our position.\nIf we are a PFIC in any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder owns our ordinary shares, the U.S. Holder could be liable for additional taxes and\ninterest charges under the “PFIC excess distribution regime” upon (1) a distribution paid during a taxable year that is greater than 125% of the average\nannual distributions paid in the three preceding taxable years, or, if shorter, the U.S. Holder’s holding period for our ordinary shares , and (2) any gain\nrecognized on a sale, exchange or other disposition, including a pledge, of our ordinary shares, whether or not we continue to be a PFIC. Under the PFIC\nexcess distribution regime, the tax on such distribution or gain would be determined by allocating the distribution or gain ratably over the U.S. Holder’s\nholding period for our ordinary shares. The amount allocated to the current taxable year (i.e., the year in which the distribution occurs or the gain is\nrecognized) and any year prior to the first taxable year in which we are a PFIC will be taxed as ordinary income earned in the current taxable year. The\namount allocated to other taxable years will be taxed at the highest marginal rates in effect for individuals or corporations, as applicable, to ordinary income\nfor each such taxable year, and an interest charge, generally applicable to underpayments of tax, will be added to the tax.\nIf we are a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares, we must generally continue to be treated as a PFIC by that holder\nfor all succeeding years during which the U.S. Holder holds such ordinary shares, unless we cease to meet the requirements for PFIC status and the U.S.\nHolder makes a “deemed sale” election with respect to our ordinary shares. If the election is made, the U.S. Holder will be deemed to sell our ordinary\nshares it holds at their fair market value on the last day of the last taxable year in which we qualified as a PFIC, and any gain recognized from such deemed\nsale would be taxed under the PFIC excess distribution regime. After the deemed sale election, the U.S. Holder’s ordinary shares would not be treated as\nshares of a PFIC unless we subsequently become a PFIC.\nIf we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ordinary shares and one of our non-United States subsidiaries is also a\nPFIC (i.e., a lower-tier PFIC), such U.S. Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC and\nwould be taxed under the PFIC excess distribution regime on distributions by the lower-tier PFIC and on gain from the disposition of shares of the lower-\ntier PFIC even though such U.S. Holder would not receive the proceeds of those distributions or dispositions. Any of our non-United States subsidiaries\nthat have elected to be disregarded as entities separate from us or as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes would not be corporations under\nU.S. federal income tax law and accordingly, cannot be classified as lower-tier PFICs. However, non-United States subsidiaries that have not made the\nelection may be classified as a lower-tier PFIC if we are a PFIC during your holding period and the subsidiary meets the PFIC income test or PFIC asset\ntest. Each U.S. Holder is advised to consult its tax advisors regarding the application of the PFIC rules to any of our non-United States subsidiaries.\nIf we are a PFIC, a U.S. Holder will not be subject to tax under the PFIC excess distribution regime on distributions or gain recognized on our ordinary\nshares if a valid “mark-to-market” election is made by the U.S. Holder for our ordinary shares. An electing U.S. Holder generally would take into account\nas ordinary income each year, the excess of the fair market value of our ordinary shares held at the end of such taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of\nsuch ordinary shares. The U.S. Holder would also take into account, as an ordinary loss each year, the excess of the adjusted tax basis of such ordinary\nshares over their fair market value at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the excess of amounts previously included in income over\nordinary losses deducted as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder’s tax basis in our ordinary shares would be adjusted to reflect any\nincome or loss recognized as a result of the mark-to-market election. Any gain from a sale, exchange or other disposition of our ordinary shares in any\ntaxable year in which we are a PFIC would be treated as ordinary income and any loss from such sale, exchange or other disposition would be treated first\nas ordinary loss (to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains previously included in income) and thereafter as capital loss. If, after having been a PFIC for\na taxable year, we cease to be classified as a PFIC because we no longer meet the PFIC income or PFIC asset test, the U.S. Holder would not be required to\ntake into account any latent gain or loss in the manner described above and any gain or loss recognized on the sale or exchange of the ordinary shares\nwould be classified as a capital gain or loss.\nA mark-to-market election is available to a U.S. Holder only for “marketable stock.” Generally, stock will be considered marketable stock if it is\n“regularly traded” on a “qualified exchange” within the meaning of applicable U.S. Treasury regulations. A class of stock is regularly traded during any\ncalendar year during which such class of stock is traded, other than in de minimis quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter.\n65\nOur ordinary shares are marketable stock as long as they remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and are regularly traded. A mark-to-market\nelection will not apply to the ordinary shares for any taxable year during which we are not a PFIC, but will remain in effect with respect to any subsequent\ntaxable year in which we become a PFIC. Such election will not apply to any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Accordingly, a U.S. Holder may continue to be\nsubject to tax under the PFIC excess distribution regime with respect to any lower-tier PFICs notwithstanding the U.S. Holder’s mark-to-market election\nfor the ordinary shares.\nExcept for stamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands, no stamp duty,\ncapital duty, registration or other issue or documentary taxes are payable in the Cayman Islands on the creation, issuance or delivery of the ordinary shares.\nThe Cayman Islands currently have no form of income, corporate or capital gains tax and no estate duty, inheritance tax or gift tax. There are currently no\nCayman Islands’ taxes or duties of any nature on gains realized on a sale, exchange, conversion, transfer or redemption of the ordinary shares. Payments of\ndividends and capital in respect of the ordinary shares will not be subject to taxation in the Cayman Islands and no withholding will be required on the\npayment of interest and principal or a dividend or capital to any holder of the ordinary shares, nor will gains derived from the disposal of the ordinary\nshares be subject to Cayman Islands income or corporation tax as the Cayman Islands currently have no form of income or corporation taxes.\nThe tax consequences that would apply if we are a PFIC would also be different from those described above if a U.S. Holder were able to make a valid\nqualified electing fund, or “QEF”, election. As we do not expect to provide U.S. Holders with the information necessary for a U.S. Holder to make a QEF\nelection, prospective investors should assume that a QEF election will not be available.\nThe U.S. federal income tax rules relating to PFICs are very complex. U.S. Holders and prospective U.S. investors are strongly urged to consult\ntheir own tax advisors with respect to the impact of PFIC status on the purchase, ownership and disposition of our ordinary shares, the\nconsequences to them of an investment in a PFIC, any elections available with respect to the ordinary shares and the IRS information reporting\nobligations with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of ordinary shares of a PFIC.\nDistributions\nSubject to the discussion above under “- Passive Foreign Investment Company Consequences,” a U.S. Holder that receives a distribution with respect\nto our ordinary shares generally will be required to include the gross amount of such distribution in gross income as a dividend when actually or\nconstructively received to the extent of the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of our current and/or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under U.S.\nfederal income tax principles). To the extent a distribution received by a U.S. Holder is not a dividend because it exceeds the U.S. Holder’s pro rata share of\nour current and accumulated earnings and profits, it will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital and reduce (but not below zero) the adjusted tax basis\nof the U.S. Holder’s ordinary shares. To the extent the distribution exceeds the adjusted tax basis of the U.S. Holder’s ordinary shares, the remainder will be\ntaxed as capital gain. Because we may not account for our earnings and profits in accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles, U.S. Holders should\nexpect all distributions to be reported to them as dividends.\nDistributions on our ordinary shares that are treated as dividends generally will constitute income from sources outside the United States for foreign\ntax credit purposes and generally will constitute passive category income. Such dividends will not be eligible for the “dividends received’’ deduction\ngenerally allowed to corporate shareholders with respect to dividends received from U.S. corporations. Dividends paid by a “qualified foreign corporation’’\nto certain non-corporate U.S. Holders may be are eligible for taxation at a reduced capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable\nto ordinary income provided that a holding period requirement (more than 60 days of ownership, without protection from the risk of loss, during the 121-\nday period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date) and certain other requirements are met. Each U.S. Holder is advised to consult its tax advisors\nregarding the availability of the reduced tax rate on dividends to its particular circumstances. However, if we are a PFIC for the taxable year in which the\ndividend is paid or the preceding taxable year (see discussion above under “- Passive Foreign Investment Company Consequences’’), we will not be treated\nas a qualified foreign corporation, and therefore the reduced capital gains tax rate described above will not apply.\nDividends will be included in a U.S. Holder’s income on the date of the depositary’s receipt of the dividend. The amount of any dividend income paid\nin Cayman Islands dollars will be the U.S. dollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether\nthe payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. If the dividend is converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, a U.S. Holder should not be required\nto recognize foreign currency gain or loss in respect to the dividend income. A U.S. Holder may have foreign currency gain or loss if the dividend is\nconverted into U.S. dollars after the date of receipt.\nA non-United States corporation (other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding\ntaxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation with respect to any dividend it pays on ordinary shares that are readily\ntradable on an established securities market in the United States.\n66\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Our Ordinary Shares\nSubject to the discussion above under “- Passive Foreign Investment Company Consequences,’’ a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or\nloss for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the sale, exchange or other disposition of our ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference, if any,\nbetween the amount realized (i.e., the amount of cash plus the fair market value of any property received) on the sale, exchange or other disposition and\nsuch U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares. Such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain taxable at a reduced rate for\nnon-corporate U.S. Holders or long-term capital loss if, on the date of sale, exchange or other disposition, the ordinary shares were held by the U.S. Holder\nfor more than one year. Any capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder that is not long-term capital gain is taxed at ordinary income rates. The\ndeductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss recognized from the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares will generally\nbe gain or loss from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.\nMedicare Tax\nCertain U.S. Holders that are individuals, estates or trusts and whose income exceeds certain thresholds generally are subject to a 3.8% tax on all or a\nportion of their net investment income, which may include their gross dividend income and net gains from the disposition of our ordinary shares. U.S.\nHolders that are individuals, estates or trusts are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the applicability of this Medicare tax to income and\ngains with respect to their investment in our ordinary shares.\nInformation Reporting and Backup Withholding\nU.S. Holders may be required to file certain U.S. information reporting returns with the IRS with respect to an investment in our ordinary shares,\nincluding, among others, IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets). As described above under “Passive Foreign Investment\nCompany Consequences”, each U.S. Holder who is a shareholder of a PFIC must file an annual report containing certain information. U.S. Holders paying\nmore than $100,000 for our ordinary shares may be required to file IRS Form 926 (Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation)\nreporting this payment. Substantial penalties may be imposed upon a U.S. Holder that fails to comply with the required information reporting.\nDividends on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our ordinary shares may be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. Holder establishes a\nbasis for exemption. Backup withholding may apply to amounts subject to reporting if the holder (1) fails to provide an accurate U.S. taxpayer\nidentification number or otherwise establish a basis for exemption, or (2) is described in certain other categories of persons. However, U.S. Holders that are\ncorporations generally are excluded from these information reporting and backup withholding tax rules.\nBackup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will be allowed as a refund or a\ncredit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is furnished by the U.S. Holder on a timely basis to the IRS.\nU.S. Holders and prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the backup withholding tax and information reporting rules.\nU.S. HOLDERS AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS ABOUT THE TAX\nCONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF AN INVESTMENT IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES IN LIGHT OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL\nCIRCUMSTANCES.\nCayman Taxation\nHolders and prospective investors should consult their professional advisers on the possible tax consequences of buying, holding or selling any\nordinary shares under the laws of their country of citizenship, residence or domicile.\nThe following is a discussion on certain Cayman Islands income tax consequences of an investment in our ordinary shares. The discussion is a general\nsummary of present law, which is subject to prospective and retroactive change. It is not intended as tax advice, does not consider any investor’s particular\ncircumstances, and does not consider tax consequences other than those arising under Cayman Islands law.\n67\nCayman Islands Taxation\nThe Cayman Islands currently levies no taxes on individuals or corporations based upon profits, income, gains or appreciation and there is no taxation\nin the nature of inheritance tax or estate duty. There are no other taxes likely to be material to us levied by the government of the Cayman Islands except for\nstamp duties which may be applicable on instruments executed in, or brought within the jurisdiction of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands is not\nparty to any double tax treaties that are applicable to any payments made to or by our company. There are no exchange control regulations or currency\nrestrictions in the Cayman Islands.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and, as such, we have obtained an\nundertaking from the Governor of the Cayman Islands that no law enacted in the Cayman Islands during the period of 30 years November 16, 2018\nimposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall apply to us or our operations and no such tax or any tax in the nature of estate\nduty or inheritance tax shall be payable (directly or by way of withholding) on the ordinary shares, debentures or other obligations of ours.\nPRC\nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law, an enterprise established outside the PRC with a “de facto management body” within the PRC is considered a\nPRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes and is generally subject to a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate on its worldwide\nincome as well as tax reporting obligations. Under the Implementation Rules, a “de facto management body” is defined as a body that has material and\noverall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise.\nUnder the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside China with “de facto management body”\nwithin China is considered a resident enterprise. The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as the body that exercises full and\nsubstantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State\nAdministration of Taxation issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto\nmanagement body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore\nenterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the\ncircular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” text should be applied in determining\nthe tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC\nenterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China only if all of the following conditions\nare met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in China; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human\nresource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in China; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and\nrecords, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in China; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior\nexecutives habitually reside in China.\nF. Dividends and Paying Agents\nNot applicable.\nG. Statement by Experts\nNot applicable.\nH. Documents on Display\nWe previously filed with the SEC our registration statement on Form F-1 (Registration No. 333-230051), as amended, including the prospectus\ncontained therein, to register our ordinary shares in relation to our initial public offering. As a “foreign private issuer,” we are subject to periodic reporting\nand other informational requirements of the Exchange Act that are applicable to foreign private issuers, and under those requirements file reports and other\ninformation with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 20-F and reports on Form 6-K. Specifically, we are required to file annually a Form 20-F no\nlater than four months after the close of each fiscal year.\nYou may review a copy of the registration statement, including exhibits and any schedule filed therewith, and any other reports or other information,\nand obtain copies of such materials at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. You may obtain information on\nthe operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains\nreports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers, like us, that file electronically with the SEC.\nWe maintain a website at http://www.bluehatgroup.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of, and\nshall not be incorporated by reference into, this annual report.\nI. Subsidiary Information\nFor information on our subsidiaries, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—A. History and Development of the Company and C. Organizational\nStructure”, note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in “Item 18. Financial Statements” and Exhibit 8.1 to this annual report.\n68\nITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk while we have short-term bank loans outstanding. Although interest rates for our short-term loans are typically\nfixed for the terms of the loans, the terms are typically twelve months and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is controlled by the application of credit approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. We manage credit risk through in-house research and\nanalysis of the Chinese economy and the underlying obligors and transaction structures. We identify credit risk collectively based on industry, geography\nand customer type. In measuring the credit risk of our sales to our customers, we mainly reflect the “probability of default” by the customer on its\ncontractual obligations and consider the current financial position of the customer and the current and likely future exposures to the customer.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe are also exposed to liquidity risk which is risk that it we will be unable to provide sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our\ncommitments and business needs. Liquidity risk is controlled by the application of financial position analysis and monitoring procedures. When necessary,\nwe will turn to other financial institutions and related parties to obtain short-term funding to cover any liquidity shortage.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWhile our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, almost all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in RMB.\nAll of our assets are denominated in RMB. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected\nby fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB. If the RMB depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the value of our RMB revenues,\nearnings and assets as expressed in our U.S. dollar financial statements will decline. We have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to\nreduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk.\nITEM 12. DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES OTHER THAN EQUITY SECURITIES\nA.

Memorandum and Articles of Association” for a description of the rights of securities holders, which remain\nunchanged.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe following “Use of Proceeds” information relates to the registration statement on Form F-1, as amended (File No. 333-230051), in relation to our\ninitial public offering, or the F-1 Registration Statement, which was declared effective by the SEC on July 25, 2019. In July 2019, we completed our initial\npublic offering in which we issued and sold an aggregate of 2,000,000 ordinary shares, and in August 2019, we issued and sold an additional 141,114\nordinary issues pursuant to partial exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option, for an aggregate of 2,141,114 ordinary shares, resulting in net\nproceeds to us of approximately $6.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses associated with our initial public offering paid\nor payable by us. ViewTrade Securities, Inc. acted as the sole underwriter for our initial public offering. In 2019, we used approximately $1.8 million of the\nnet proceeds from our initial public offering for research and development, selling and marketing, and working capital and other general corporate\npurposes. We intend to use the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering for research and development, selling and marketing, and working\ncapital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for investing in, or acquiring, complementary businesses,\nalthough we have not executed any definitive investment or acquisition agreements.\nWe received net proceeds of approximately $6.9 million from our initial public offering and partial exercise of the over-allotment option. Our expenses\nincurred and paid to others in connection with the issuance and distribution of our ordinary shares in our initial public offering totaled approximately\n$1,069,133, which included approximately $599,512 for underwriting discounts and commissions.\nITEM 15. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, we carried\nout an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, which is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this annual report. Based upon that evaluation, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief\nfinancial officer, has concluded that, due to the material weaknesses and significant deficiencies described below under “Changes in Internal Control Over\nFinancial Reporting”, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that\nthe information required to be disclosed by us in this annual report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to them for assessment, and required\ndisclosure is made within the time period specified in the rules and forms of the SEC.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Attestation Report of Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis annual report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of\nthe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nfor newly public companies.\n70\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nIn the course of auditing our consolidated financial statements for years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, three material weaknesses\nwere identified in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\nof the United States, and other significant deficiencies. A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over\nfinancial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not\nbe prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses identified related to:\n1) No sufficient personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to\nprepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP;\n2) Ineffective oversight of our financial reporting and internal control by those charged with governance; and\n3) Inadequate design of internal control over the preparation of the financial statements being audited.\nA number of significant deficiencies in our internal controls have also been identified.\nWe are currently in the process of remediating the material weaknesses described above and we intend to continue implementing the following\nmeasures, among others, to remediate the material weaknesses:\n● We plan to add more qualified accounting and reporting personnel with appropriate knowledge and experience of U.S. GAAP and SEC financial\nreporting requirements;\n● We plan to organize regular training for our accounting and reporting personnel, especially training related to U.S. GAAP and SEC financial\nreporting requirements; and\n● We plan to complete an upgrade of our financial system to enhance its effectiveness and financial and system control.\nWe also plan to further develop our compliance process, and establish a comprehensive policy and procedure manual, to allow early detection,\nprevention and resolution of potential compliance issues, in order to improve our internal controls over financial reporting to remediate the abovementioned\nmaterial weaknesses.\nAs we were in the process of implementing such remedial measures as of December 31, 2019, our management concluded that the material\nweaknesses had not been fully remediated and that such material weaknesses still existed.\nWe are fully committed to continuing to implement measures to remediate our material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in our internal control\nover financial reporting. However, we cannot assure you that we will remediate our material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in a timely manner.\nWe and our independent registered public accounting firm were not required to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2019. Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm undertook a comprehensive assessment of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the purposes of identifying and reporting any material weakness or significant deficiency in our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Had we performed a formal assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or had our independent\nregistered public accounting firm performed an audit of our internal control over financial reporting, additional material weaknesses and significant\ndeficiencies may have been identified. See “Item 3. Key Information—D. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—If we fail to implement and\nmaintain an effective system of internal control, we may be unable to accurately report our operating results, meet our reporting obligations or prevent\nfraud.”\nAs a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue for our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the JOBS Act.\nAn emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public\ncompanies. These provisions include exemption from the auditor attestation requirement under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in the\nassessment of the emerging growth company’s internal control over financial reporting. We may take advantage of such exemption until the last day of our\nfiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our ordinary shares pursuant to our initial public offering. However, if certain\nevents occur before the end of such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion or\nwe issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company before the end of such\nfive-year period.\nOther than as described above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired by Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the period covered by this annual report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to\nmaterially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n71\nITEM 16A. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT\nOur board of directors has determined that Mr. Qinyi Fu, an independent director, under the standards set forth under the Nasdaq Capital Market\ncorporate governance requirements and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and the chair of our audit committee, is an audit committee financial expert.\nITEM 16B. CODE OF ETHICS\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all of our directors and employees, including our principal executive officer,\nprincipal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, which is a “code of ethics” as defined in Item\n16B of Form 20-F promulgated by the SEC and as required by the Nasdaq rules. The full text of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our\nwebsite at www.irbluehatgroup.com. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website does not constitute a part of this annual report\nand is not incorporated by reference herein. We will provide a copy of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics without charge upon request by mail or by\ntelephone. If we make any amendment to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or grant any waivers, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of\nthe Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website to the extent required by the rules and\nregulations of the SEC.\nITEM 16C. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following table sets forth the aggregate fees by categories specified below in connection with certain professional services rendered by our\nprincipal external auditor, for the periods indicated.\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\n2018 2019\nAudit fees (1) $ 200,000 $ 144,000\nAudit-related fees (2) - 18,000\nTax fees(3) - -\n(1) “Audit fees” represents the aggregate fees billed for each of the fiscal years listed for professional services rendered by our principal accounting firm\nfor the audit of our annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the auditors in connection with statutory and regulatory\nfilings or engagements.\n(2) “Audit-related fees” represents the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by our principal accounting firm for the assurance and\nrelated services, which mainly included the audit and review of financial statements and are not reported under “Audit Fees” above.\n(3) “Tax fees” represents the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by our principal accounting firm for tax compliance, tax advice and\ntax planning.\nThe policy of our audit committee is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services including audit services, audit-related services, tax services and\nother services as described above.\nITEM 16D.

CHANGE IN REGISTRANT’S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT\nOn January 22, 2020, we dismissed Friedman LLP, or Friedman, and engaged JLKZ CPA LLP, or JLKZ, as our independent registered public\naccounting firm in connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decision to authorize the\ndismissal of Friedman and the engagement of JLKZ was approved by our Audit Committee and by our Board of Directors. Friedman’s report on our\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion\nand was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018,\nand through January 22, 2020, we did not have any disagreements, as that term is defined in Item 16F(a)(1)(iv) of Form 20-F and the related instructions to\nItem 16F of Form 20-F, with Friedman on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures\nthat, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Friedman, would have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with\nits audit reports on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018. During each of the years ended December 31,\n2017 and 2018, and through January 22, 2020, there were no “reportable events”, as defined below, requiring disclosure by us pursuant to Item 16F(a)(1)(v)\nof Form 20-F, except for Friedman having advised us that the internal controls necessary for us to develop reliable financial statements did not exist for the\nreasons stated below.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources with which to address our\ninternal controls and procedures. Our management has not completed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and\nour independent registered public accounting firm has not conducted an audit of our internal control over financial reporting. In the course of auditing our\nconsolidated financial statements, three material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting were identified by us and Friedman, specifically: (i)\nno sufficient personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare\nand review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii) ineffective oversight of our financial reporting and internal control by those\ncharged with governance; and (iii) inadequate design of internal control over the preparation of the financial statements being audited. These material\nweaknesses remain as of December 31, 2019.\nFor purposes of this Item 16F, the term “reportable events” means any of the following events:\n(A) The accountant’s having advised the registrant that the internal controls necessary for the registrant to develop reliable financial statements do not\nexist;\n(B) The accountant’s having advised the registrant that information has come to the accountant’s attention that has led it to no longer be able to rely on\nmanagement’s representations, or that has made it unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management;\n(C) (1) The accountant’s having advised the registrant of the need to expand significantly the scope of its audit, or that information has come to the\naccountant’s attention during the time period covered by Item 16F(a)(1)(iv), that if further investigated may: (i) Materially impact the fairness or reliability\nof either: a previously issued audit report or the underlying financial statements; or the financial statements issued or to be issued covering the fiscal\nperiod(s) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements covered by an audit report (including information that may prevent it from\nrendering an unqualified audit report on those financial statements); or (ii) Cause it to be unwilling to rely on management’s representations or be\nassociated with the registrant’s financial statements; and (2) Due to the accountant’s resignation (due to audit scope limitations or otherwise) or dismissal,\nor for any other reason, the accountant did not so expand the scope of its audit or conduct such further investigation; or\n(D)(1) The accountant’s having advised the registrant that information has come to the accountant’s attention that it has concluded materially impacts\nthe fairness or reliability of either (i) a previously issued audit report or the underlying financial statements, or (ii) the financial statements issued or to be\nissued covering the fiscal period(s) subsequent to the date of the most recent financial statements covered by an audit report (including information that,\nunless resolved to the accountant’s satisfaction, would prevent it from rendering an unqualified audit report on those financial statements); and (2) Due to\nthe accountant’s resignation, dismissal or declination to stand for reelection, or for any other reason, the issue has not been resolved to the accountant’s\nsatisfaction prior to its resignation, dismissal or declination to stand for re-election.\nDuring each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, and through January 22, 2020, we did not consult with JLKZ regarding either (i) the\napplication of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed or (ii) the type of audit opinion that may be rendered by JLKZ\non our financial statements. Neither a written report nor oral advice was provided by JLKZ to us that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a\ndecision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue. We have not consulted with JLKZ regarding any matter that was either the subject of a\ndisagreement or a “reportable event,” each as defined in Item 16F of Form 20-F.\nWe provided a copy of this disclosure to Friedman and requested that Friedman furnish us with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees\nwith the statements made above, and if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of Friedman’s letter dated May 11, 2020 is filed herewith\nas Exhibit 15.1.\nITEM 16G. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nAs a Cayman Islands company listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are subject to the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. The Nasdaq\nrules permit a foreign private issuer like us to follow the corporate governance practices of its home country. Certain corporate governance practices in the\nCayman Islands, which is our home country, may differ significantly from the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. Currently, we do not plan to\nrely on home country practice with respect to our corporate governance. However, if we choose to follow home country practice in the future, our\nshareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would enjoy under the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S.\ndomestic issuers.\nITEM 16H.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company\nin accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES - continued\nContractual Arrangements\nDue to legal restrictions on foreign ownership and investment in, among other areas, the production, development and operation of AR interactive\nentertainment games and toys in China, including interactive educational materials, mobile games, and toys with mobile game features, the\nCompany operates its businesses in which foreign investment is restricted or prohibited in the PRC through certain PRC domestic companies. As\nsuch, Blue Hat Fujian is controlled through contractual arrangements in lieu of direct equity ownership by the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nSuch contractual arrangements consist of a series of three agreements, along with shareholders’ powers of attorney (“POAs”) and irrevocable\ncommitment letters (collectively the “Contractual Arrangements”, which were signed on November 13, 2018).\nThe significant terms of the Contractual Arrangements are as follows:\nExclusive Business Cooperation Agreement\nPursuant to the exclusive business cooperation agreement between Blue Hat WFOE and Blue Hat Fujian, Blue Hat WFOE has the exclusive right\nto provide Blue Hat Fujian with technical support services, consulting services and other services, including technical support, technical\nassistance, technical consulting, and professional training necessary for Blue Hat Fujian’s operation, network support, database support, software\nservices, business management consulting, grant use rights of intellectual property rights, lease hardware and device, provide system integration\nservice, research and development of software and system maintenance, provide labor support and to develop the related technologies based on\nBlue Hat Fujian’s needs. In exchange, Blue Hat WFOE is entitled to a service fee that equals to all of the consolidated net income after offsetting\nprevious year’s loss (if any) of Blue Hat Fujian. The service fee may be adjusted by Blue Hat WFOE based on the actual scope of services\nrendered by Blue Hat WFOE and the operational needs and expanding demands of Blue Hat Fujian.\nPursuant to the exclusive business cooperation agreement, Blue Hat WFOE has the unilateral right to adjust the service fee at any time, and Blue\nHat Fujian has no right to adjust the service fee. We believe that such conditions under which the service fee may be adjusted will be primarily\nbased on the needs of Blue Hat Fujian to operate and develop its business in the augmented reality market. For example, if Blue Hat Fujian needs\nto expand its business, increase research input or consummate mergers or acquisitions in the future, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to decrease the\namount of the service fee, which would allow Blue Hat Fujian to have additional capital to operate and develop its business in the augmented\nreality market.\nThe exclusive business cooperation agreement remains in effect until November 13, 2028 and shall be automatically renewed for one year at the\nexpiration date of the validity term. However, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to terminate this agreement upon giving 30 days’ prior written notice\nto Blue Hat Fujian at any time.\nCall Option Agreements\nPursuant to the call option agreements, among Blue Hat WFOE, Blue Hat Fujian and the shareholders who collectively owned all of Blue Hat\nFujian, such shareholders jointly and severally grant Blue Hat WFOE an option to purchase their equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian. The purchase\nprice shall be the lowest price then permitted under applicable PRC laws. Blue Hat WFOE or its designated person may exercise such option at\nany time to purchase all or part of the equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian until it has acquired all equity interests of Blue Hat Fujian, which is\nirrevocable during the term of the agreements.\nThe call option agreements remain in effect until November 13, 2028 and shall be automatically renewed for one year at the expiration date of the\nvalidity term. However, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to terminate these agreements upon giving 30 days’ prior written notice to Blue Hat Fujian\nat any time.\nF-11\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES - continued\nEquity Pledge Agreement\nPursuant to the equity pledge agreement, among Blue Hat WFOE, Blue Hat Fujian, and the shareholders who collectively owned all of Blue Hat\nFujian, such shareholders pledge all of the equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian to Blue Hat WFOE as collateral to secure the obligations of Blue Hat\nFujian under the exclusive business cooperation agreement and call option agreements. These shareholders are prohibited from transferring the\npledged equity interests without the prior consent of Blue Hat WFOE unless transferring the equity interests to Blue Hat WFOE or its designated\nperson in accordance to the call option agreements.\nThe equity pledge agreement shall come into force the date on which the pledged interests is recorded, which is three days after signing of the\nAgreement on November 13, 2018, under Blue Hat Fujian’s register of shareholders and is registered with competent administration for industry\nand commerce of Blue Hat Fujian until all of the liabilities and debts to Blue Hat WFOE have been fulfilled completely by Blue Hat Fujian. Blue\nHat Fujian and the shareholders who collectively owned all of Blue Hat Fujian shall not terminate these agreements in any circumstance for any\nreason. However, Blue Hat WFOE has the right to terminate these agreements upon giving 30 days’ prior written notice to Blue Hat Fujian at any\ntime.\nShareholders’ Powers of Attorney (“POAs”)\nPursuant to the shareholders’ POAs, the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian give Blue Hat WFOE an irrevocable proxy to act on their behalf on all\nmatters pertaining to Blue Hat Fujian and to exercise all of their rights as shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian, including the right to attend\nshareholders meeting, to exercise voting rights and all of the other rights, and to sign transfer documents and any other documents in relation to the\nfulfillment of the obligations under the call option agreements and the equity pledge agreement. The shareholder POAs shall remain in effect while\nthe shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian hold the equity interests in Blue Hat Fujian.\nIrrevocable Commitment Letters\nPursuant to the irrevocable commitment letters, the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian commit that their spouses or inheritors have no right to claim\nany rights or interest in relation to the shares that they hold in Blue Hat Fujian and have no right to impose any impact on the daily managing\nduties of Blue Hat Fujian, and commit that if any event which refrains them from exercising shareholders’ rights as a registered shareholder, such\nas death, incapacity, divorce or any other event, could happen to them, the shareholders of Blue Hat Fujian will take corresponding measures to\nguarantee the rights of other registered shareholders and the performance of the Contractual Arrangements. The letters are irrevocable and shall\nnot be withdrawn without the consent of Blue Hat WFOE.\nBased on the foregoing contractual arrangements, which grant Blue Hat WFOE effective control of Blue Hat Fujian and enable Blue Hat WFOE to\nreceive all of their expected residual returns, the Company accounts for Blue Hat Fujian as a VIE. Accordingly, the Company consolidates the\naccounts of Blue Hat Fujian for the periods presented herein, in accordance with Regulation S-X-3A-02 promulgated by the Securities Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”), and Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810-10, Consolidation.\nF-12\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, which include the wholly- foreign\nowned enterprise (\"WFOE\") and variable interest entities (\"VIEs\") over which the Company exercises control and, when applicable, entities for\nwhich the Company has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. All transactions and balances among the Company and its\nsubsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that\naffect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements include the useful lives of plant and equipment and intangible assets, capitalized development costs,\nimpairment of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, revenue recognition, allowance for deferred tax assets and uncertain tax\nposition, and inventory allowance. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nForeign currency translation and transaction\nThe reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The Company in China conducts its businesses in the local currency, Renminbi (RMB),\nas its functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate as quoted by the People’s Bank of China at the end of\nthe period. The statement of income accounts is translated at the average translation rates and the equity accounts are translated at historical rates.\nTranslation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains and losses that\narise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of\noperations as incurred.\nTranslation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) amounted to $(1,478,667), $(956,929) and $517,197 as of\nDecember 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The balance sheet amounts, with the exception of shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2019,\n2018 and 2017 were translated at 6.98 RMB, 6.88 RMB and 6.51 RMB, respectively. The shareholders’ equity accounts were stated at their\nhistorical rate. The average translation rates applied to statement of income accounts for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were\n6.89 RMB, 6.62 RMB and 6.76 RMB to $1.00, respectively. Cash flows are also translated at average translation rates for the periods, therefore,\namounts reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the consolidated balance\nsheet.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand; demand deposits and time deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and have\noriginal maturities of less than three months.\nRestricted cash\nAmount mainly includes pledged deposits for bank loans of the Company. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, restricted cash amounted to\n$5,000,000 and $0, respectively.\nF-13\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable include trade accounts due from customers. Accounts are considered overdue after 30 days. In establishing the required\nallowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical collection experience, aging of the receivables, the economic environment,\nindustry trend analysis, and the credit history and financial conditions of the customers. Management reviews its receivables on a regular basis to\ndetermine if the bad debt allowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off against\nallowance for doubtful accounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. As of December 31, 2019 and\n2018, allowance for the doubtful accounts was $1,467,374 and $644,090, respectively.\nOther receivables, net\nOther receivables primarily include deposits for business acquisitions, setup of research center, advances to employees, and others. Management\nregularly reviews the aging of receivables and changes in payment trends and records allowances when management believes collection of\namounts due are at risk. Accounts considered uncollectable are written off against allowances after exhaustive efforts at collection are made. As of\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, allowance for the doubtful accounts was $42,676 and $29,571, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are comprised of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average method.\nManagement reviews inventories for obsolescence and cost in excess of net realizable value quarterly and records a reserve against the inventory\nwhen the carrying value exceeds net realizable value.\nPrepayments, net\nCurrent\nPrepayments are cash deposited or advanced to suppliers for future inventory purchases. This amount is refundable and bears no interest. For any\nadvances to suppliers determined by management that such advances will not be in receipts of inventories or refundable, the Company will\nrecognize an allowance account to reserve such balances. Management reviews its advances to suppliers on a regular basis to determine if the\nallowance is adequate, and adjusts the allowance when necessary. Delinquent account balances are written-off against allowance for doubtful\naccounts after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable. The Company’s management continues to evaluate the\nreasonableness of the valuation allowance policy and update it if necessary. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, allowance for the doubtful\naccounts was $188,264 and $124,740, respectively.\nNon-current\nNon-current prepayment represents cash deposited or advanced for software development expenditure. This amount is refundable and bears no\ninterest.\nProperty and equipment, net\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the\nestimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful lives are as follows:\nCategory Depreciation method Estimated useful lives\nElectronic devices Straight-line 3 years\nOffice equipment, fixtures and furniture Straight-line 3 years\nAutomobile Straight-line 3 years\nF-14\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nProperty and equipment, net - continued\nThe cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss is included\nin the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as\nincurred, while additions, renewals and betterments, which are expected to extend the useful life of assets, are capitalized. The Company also re-\nevaluates the periods of depreciation to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives.\nIntangible assets\nThe Company’s intangible assets with definite useful lives primarily consist of software development costs, patents and licensed software. The\nCompany amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The\nCompany typically amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the contractual terms or the\nestimated useful lives of five to ten years.\nSoftware development costs\nThe Company follows the provisions of ASC 350-40, “Internal Use Software”, to capitalize certain direct development costs associated with\ninternal- used software. ASC 350-40 provides guidance on capitalization of the costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for\ninternal use. The Company expenses all costs incurred during the preliminary project stage of its development, and capitalizes costs incurred\nduring the application development stage. Costs incurred relating to upgrades and enhancements to the application are capitalized if it is\ndetermined that these upgrades or enhancements add additional functionality to the application. The capitalized development cost is amortized on\na straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally five years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an\nannual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses include salaries and other compensation-related expenses to the Company’s research and product\ndevelopment personnel, as well as office rental, depreciation and related expenses for the Company’s research and product development team. The\nCompany expenses all costs that are incurred in connection with the planning and implementation phases of development, and costs that are\nassociated with maintenance of the existing websites or software for internal use.\nImpairment for long-lived assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances (such as a significant adverse change to market conditions that will impact the future use of the assets) indicate that the\ncarrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash\nflows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from\nthe use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. If an impairment is\nidentified, the Company would reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows approach or,\nwhen available and appropriate, to comparable market values. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, no impairment of long-lived assets was\nrecognized.\nF-15\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nLong-term investments\nLong-term investments include cost method investment and equity method investments.\nEntities in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling interest, are accounted for using the\nequity method. Significant influence is generally considered to exist when the Company has voting shares between 20% and 50%, and other\nfactors, such as representation on the Board of Directors, voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining\nwhether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. Under this method of accounting, the Company records its proportionate share of the net\nearnings or losses of equity method investees and a corresponding increase or decrease to the investment balances. Dividends received from the\nequity method investments are recorded as reductions in the cost of such investments.\nThe Company accounts for investments with less than 20% of the voting shares and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over\noperating and financial policies of the investee using the cost method. The Company records cost method investments at the historical cost in its\nconsolidated financial statements and subsequently records any dividends received from the net accumulated earrings of the investee as income.\nDividends received in excess of earnings are considered a return of investment and are recorded as reduction in the cost of the investments.\nLong-term investments are evaluated for impairment when facts or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the long-term investments is less\nthan its carrying value. Impairment is recognized when a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than- temporary. The Company reviews\nseveral factors to determine whether a loss is other-than-temporary. These factors include, but are not limited to, the: (i) nature of the investment;\n(ii) cause and duration of the impairment; (iii) extent to which fair value is less than cost; financial condition and near term prospects of the\ninvestments; and (v) ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. No event had\noccurred and indicated that other-than-temporary impairment existed and therefore the Company did not record any impairment charges for its\ninvestments for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nFair value measurement\nThe accounting standard regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements defines financial instruments and\nrequires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company.\nThe accounting standards define fair value, establish a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance\ndisclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels are defined as follow:\nLevel 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are\nobservable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\nF-16\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The ASU requires\nthe use of a new five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The five-step model requires that the Company (i) identify the\ncontract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable\nconsideration to the extent that it is probable that a significant future reversal will not occur, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the respective\nperformance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies the performance obligation.\nSales of interactive toys\nThe Company recognizes sales of interactive toys revenues upon shipment or upon receipt of products by the customer, depending on the terms,\nprovided that: there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; persuasive evidence of an agreement exists documenting the specific\nterms of the transaction; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. Management assesses the business\nenvironment, the customer’s financial condition, historical collection experience, accounts receivable aging, and customer disputes to determine\nwhether collectability is reasonably assured.\nThe Company routinely enters into arrangements with its customers to provide sales incentives, support customer promotions, and provide\nallowances for returns and defective merchandise. Such programs are based primarily on customer purchases, customer performance of specified\npromotional activities, and other specified factors such as sales to consumers. The costs of these programs are recorded as sales adjustments that\nreduce gross sales in the period the related sale is recognized.\nThe products sold in the PRC are subject to a Chinese value-added tax (“VAT”). VAT taxes are presented as a reduction of revenue.\nMobile games\nInternal developed platform\nThe Company operates the mobile games as live services that allow players to play for free. Within these games, players can purchase virtual\ncurrency to obtain virtual goods to enhance the game-playing experience. On the platform, players purchase virtual currency and/or virtual goods\nthrough various widely accepted payment methods offered in the games, including Alipay or WeChat and online bank transfer service providers.\nAdvance payments from customers for virtual goods that are non-refundable that specify our obligations are recorded to deferred revenue. All\nother advance payments that do not meet these criteria are recorded as advances from customers. For virtual goods purchases upon immediately\nuse with no future game-playing benefits, the Company recognizes such virtual goods purchase upon receipts of payment from the paying players.\nFor virtual goods purchases for the conversion of future game-playing benefits or throughout the players’ playing life, the Company recognizes\nsuch virtual goods purchases ratably over the estimated average playing period of paying players for the applicable game, starting from the point\nin time when virtual items are delivered to the players’ accounts and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company records revenue\ngenerated from mobile games on a gross basis as the Company is acting as the principal to fulfill all obligations related to the game operation. Fees\npaid to distribution channels and payment channels are recorded as cost of revenues.\nF-17\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nRevenue recognition - continued\nMobile games - continued\nInternal developed platform - continued\nThe Company considers the average period that players typically play the games and other game player behavior patterns, as well as various other\nfactors to arrive at the best estimates for the estimated playing period of the paying players for each game. On a quarterly basis, the Company\ndetermined the estimated average playing period for paying players by analyzing paying players for that game who made their first virtual goods\npurchase during that period and counting their cumulative login days for each game. The Company then averages the time periods to determine the\nestimated paying playing period for that game. If a new game is launched and only a limited period of paying player data is available, then the\nCompany considers other qualitative factors, such as the playing patterns for paying players for other games with similar characteristics and\nplaying patterns of paying players, such as targeted players and purchasing frequency. While the Company believes its estimates to be reasonable\nbased on available game player information, the Company may revise such estimates based on new information indicating a change in the game\nplayer behavior patterns and any adjustments are applied prospectively.\nBased on the Company’s analysis, the estimated average playing period of paying players is approximately one to three months, and this estimate\nhas been consistent since the Company’s initial analysis. No change has been made in such estimate during any of the periods presented. Future\nusage patterns may differ from historical usage patterns and therefore the estimated average playing periods may change in the future.\nThird-party platform\nIn addition, the Company also licenses third-parties to operate the Company’s mobile games developed internally through mobile platforms and\nreceives revenue-based royalty payments from all the third-party licensee operators on a monthly basis.\nThe revenue- based royalty payments are recognized when all other revenue recognition criteria are met. The Company records the mobile game\nroyalty revenue on a net basis, as the Company does not have the primary responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the game services.\nShipping and handling\nShipping and handling costs amounted to $125,640, $114,558 and $150,776 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nShipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling expenses.\nAdvertising costs\nAdvertising costs amounted to $31,176, $87,956 and $291,782 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Advertising\ncosts are expensed as incurred and included in selling expenses.\nOperating leases\nA lease for which substantially all the benefits and risks incidental to ownership remain with the lessor is classified by the lessee as an operating\nlease. All leases of the Company are currently classified as operating leases. The Company records the total expenses on a straight-line basis over\nthe lease term, and the accounting of operating lease in this report has been updated to reflect the adoption of FASB’s new guidance on the\nrecognition and measurement of leases.\nGovernment subsidies\nGovernment subsidies mainly represent amounts granted by local government authorities as an incentive for companies to promote development\nof the local technology industry. The Company receives government subsidies related to government sponsored projects, and records such\ngovernment subsidies as a liability when it is received. The Company records government subsidies as other income when there is no further\nperformance obligation.\nF-18\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nGovernment subsidies- continued\nTotal government subsidies amounted to $221,467, $94,088 and $328,346 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nValue added taxes\nRevenue represents the invoiced value of service, net of VAT. The VAT is based on gross sales price and VAT rates range up to 17%, depending on\nthe type of service provided. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output\nVAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded in tax payable. All of the VAT returns filed by the Company’s\nsubsidiaries in China have been and remain subject to examination by the tax authorities for five years from the date of filing.\nIncome taxes\nThe Company accounts for current income taxes in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities. The charge for taxation is based on the\nresults for the fiscal year as adjusted for items, which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or\nsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\nDeferred taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the\ncarrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of\nassessable tax profit. In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognized to\nthe extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Deferred tax is\ncalculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or\ncredited in the income statement, except when it is related to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also\ndealt with in equity. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that\nsome portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant\ntaxing authorities.\nComprehensive income\nComprehensive income consists of two components, net income and other comprehensive (loss) income. Other comprehensive (loss) income\nrefers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under U.S. GAAP are recorded as an element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net\nincome. Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of a foreign currency translation adjustment resulting from the Company not using the U.S.\ndollar as its functional currencies.\nEarnings per share\nThe Company computes earnings per share (“EPS”) in accordance with ASC 260, “Earnings per Share”. ASC 260 requires companies to present\nbasic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured as net income divided by the weighted average ordinary share outstanding for the period. Diluted\nEPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of the potential ordinary shares (e.g., convertible securities, options and warrants) as if they\nhad been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date, if later. Potential ordinary shares that have an anti-dilutive effect\n(i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no dilutive shares.\nEmployee benefits\nThe full-time employees of the Company are entitled to staff welfare benefits including medical care, housing fund, pension benefits,\nunemployment insurance and other welfare, which are government mandated defined contribution plans by law. The Company is required to\naccrue for these benefits based on certain percentages of the employees’ respective salaries, subject to certain ceilings, in accordance with the\nrelevant PRC regulations, and make cash contributions to the state-sponsored plans out of the amounts accrued. Total expenses for the plans were\n$81,118, $81,735 and $63,566 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nF-19\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nStatutory reserves\nPursuant to the laws applicable to the PRC, PRC entities must make appropriations from after-tax profit to the non-distributable \"statutory surplus\nreserve fund\". Subject to certain cumulative limits, the \"statutory surplus reserve fund\" requires annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax profit\nuntil the aggregated appropriations reach 50% of the registered capital (as determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the PRC\n(\"PRC GAAP\") at each year-end). For foreign invested enterprises and joint ventures in the PRC, annual appropriations should be made to the\n\"reserve fund\". For foreign invested enterprises, the annual appropriation for the \"reserve fund\" cannot be less than 10% of after-tax profits until\nthe aggregated appropriations reach 50% of the registered capital (as determined under PRC GAAP at each year-end). If the Company has\naccumulated loss from prior periods, the Company is able to use the current period net income after tax to offset against the accumulate loss.\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements\nIn December 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with\nCustomers” (“ASU 2016-20”), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a\nsignificant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments are intended to\naddress implementation and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These\namendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. In September 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-13, to clarify the\neffective dates that public business entities and other entities were required to adopt ASC Topic 606 for annual reporting. As an “emerging growth\ncompany,” or EGC, the Company has elected to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B)\nfor complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to private companies. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual\nreporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,\n2019. The Company adopted Topic 606 on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method and there is no material impact as\nof the date of adoption of Topic 606.\nIn September 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-13, to clarify the effective dates that public business entities and other entities were required\nto adopt ASC Topic 842 for annual reporting. A public business entity that otherwise would not meet the definition of a public business entity\nexcept for a requirement to include or the inclusion of its financial statements or financial information in another entity’s filing with the SEC\nadopting ASC Topic 842 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU No. 2017-13 also amended that all components of a leveraged lease be recalculated from\ninception of the lease based on the revised after tax cash flows arising from the change in the tax law, including revised tax rates. The difference\nbetween the amounts originally recorded and the recalculated amounts must be included in income of the year in which the tax law is enacted. The\nCompany has not early adopted this update and it will become effective on January 1, 2020.\nF-20\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES - continued\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements - continued\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of\nCertain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the\nstatement of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt\nExtinguishment Costs;(2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are\nInsignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business\nCombination; (4) Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance\nPolicies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in\nSecuritization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective\nfor public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is\npermitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period\npresented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied\nprospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The adoption of this ASU on January 1, 2018 would not have a material effect on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements.\nIn July 2017, the FASB Issued ASU 2017-11, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480) and Derivatives\nand Hedging (Topic 815). The amendments in Part I of the Update change the reclassification analysis of certain equity- lined financial\ninstruments (or embedded features) with down round features. The amendments in Part II of this Update re-characterize the indefinite deferral of\ncertain provisions of Topic 480 that now are presented as pending content in the Codification, to a scope exception. For public business entities,\nthe amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,\n2018. For all other entities, the amendments in Part I of this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim\nperiods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all entities, including adoption in an interim period.\nIf an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that\nincludes that interim period. The amendments in Part II of this Update do not require any transition guidance because those amendments do not\nhave an accounting effect. The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 to simplify the accounting in ASC 740, Income Taxes. This guidance removes certain\nexceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the\nrecognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also clarifies and simplifies other areas of ASC 740. This ASU\nwill be effective beginning on January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. Certain amendments in this update must be applied on a prospective\nbasis, certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective basis, and certain amendments must be applied on a modified retrospective basis\nthrough a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings/(deficit) in the period of adoption. The Company does not believe the adoption of this\nASU would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nExcept as mentioned above, the Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted,\nwould have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income and statements of\ncash flows.\nF-21\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n3. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (“VIE”)\nOn November 13, 2018, Blue Hat WFOE entered into Contractual Arrangements with Blue Hat Fujian. The significant terms of these Contractual\nArrangements are summarized in “Note 1 - Nature of business and organization” above. As a result, the Company classifies Blue Hat Fujian as a\nVIE which should be consolidated based on the structure as described in Note 1.\nA VIE is an entity that has either a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support, or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest, such as through voting rights,\nright to receive the expected residual returns of the entity or obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity. The variable interest holder, if\nany, that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. Blue Hat WFOE is\ndeemed to have a controlling financial interest and be the primary beneficiary of Blue Hat Fujian because it has both of the following\ncharacteristics:\nThe power to direct activities at Blue Hat Fujian that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance, and\nThe right to receive benefits from Blue Hat Fujian that could potentially be significant to such entity.\nPursuant to the Contractual Arrangements, Blue Hat Fujian pays service fees equal to all of its net income to Blue Hat WFOE. The Contractual\nArrangements are designed so that Blue Hat Fujian operates for the benefit of Blue Hat WFOE and ultimately, the Company.\nAccordingly, the account of Blue Hat Fujian is consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. In addition, its financial positions and\nresults of operations are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

TAXES\nIncome tax\nCayman Islands\nUnder the current laws of the Cayman Islands, the Company is not subject to tax on income or capital gain. Additionally, upon payments of\ndividends to the shareholders, no Cayman Islands withholding tax will be imposed.\nF-28\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n14. TAXES - continued\nIncome tax - continued\nBritish Virgin Islands\nBlue Hat BVI is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and is not subject to tax on income or capital gains under current British Virgin Islands\nlaw. In addition, upon payments of dividends by these entities to their shareholders, no British Virgin Islands withholding tax will be imposed.\nHong Kong\nBlue Hat HK is incorporated in Hong Kong and is subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax on the taxable income as reported in its statutory financial\nstatements adjusted in accordance with relevant Hong Kong tax laws. The applicable tax rate is 16.5% in Hong Kong. The Company did not make\nany provisions for Hong Kong profit tax as there were no assessable profits derived from or earned in Hong Kong since inception. Under Hong\nKong tax law, Blue Hat HK is exempted from income tax on its foreign-derived income and there are no withholding taxes in Hong Kong on\nremittance of dividends.\nPRC\nBlue Hat WFOE, Blue Hat Fujian, Blue Hat Shenyang, Blue Hat Hunan, Blue Hat Chongqing and Blue Hat Pingxiang are governed by the income\ntax laws of the PRC and the income tax provision in respect to operations in the PRC is calculated at the applicable tax rates on the taxable income\nfor the periods based on existing legislation, interpretations and practices in respect thereof. Under the Enterprise Income Tax Laws of the PRC\n(the “EIT Laws”), domestic enterprises and Foreign Investment Enterprises (the “FIE”) are usually subject to a unified 25% enterprise income tax\nrate while preferential tax rates, tax holidays and even tax exemption may be granted on case- by-case basis. EIT grants preferential tax treatment\nto certain High and New Technology Enterprises (“HNTEs”). Under this preferential tax treatment, HNTEs are entitled to an income tax rate of\n15%, subject to a requirement that they re-apply for HNTE status every three years.\nBlue Hat Fujian obtained the “high-tech enterprise” tax status in October 2015 and renewed it in December 2018, which reduced its statutory\nincome tax rate to 15% from 2018 to 2019.\nIn addition, in 2018 and 2019, the Chinese tax authority granted Blue Hat Pingxiang their tax preference on its enterprises income tax by using\n10% of gross revenue as tax basis to apply its 25% tax rate from 2018 to December 2019. The Company expects such tax preference can be\nrenewed on an annual basis.\nTax savings for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $ 2,256,051, $1,687,004 and $636,796, respectively. The\nCompany’s basic and diluted earnings per shares would have been lower by $0.06, $0.05 and $0.02 per share for the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, without the preferential tax rate reduction.\nSignificant components of the provision for income taxes are as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2019 2018\nCurrent $ 502,434 $ 712,829\nDeferred (48,710) (107,401)\nThe provision for income taxes $ 453,724 $ 605,428\nF-29\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n14. TAXES - continued\nIncome tax - continued\nPRC - continued\nThe following table reconciles China statutory rates to the Company’s effective tax rate:\nYear ended Year ended Year ended\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31,\n2019 2018 2017\nChina statutory income tax rate 25.0% 25.0% 25.0%\nPreferential tax rate reduction (10.0%) (10.0%) (10.0%)\nPreferential Blue Hat Pingxiang tax rate reduction (12.5%) (8.0%) 0.0%\nPermanent difference 2.3% 0.1% 0.7%\nEffective tax rate 4.8% 7.1% 15.7%\nDeferred tax assets – China\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets were as follows:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2019 2018\nAllowance for doubtful accounts $ 182,234 $ 135,999\nAs of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company had approximately $1,300,000, $835,000 and 230,000 of allowance for doubtful accounts\nheld at its profitable PRC VIE with deferred tax assets of approximately $182,000, $136,000 and $34,000, respectively. Based upon the level of\nhistorical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are recoverable, management\nbelieves that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets\nfor the profitable PRC VIE as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Thus, there were no valuation allowances of December 31, 2019, 2018 and\n2017 in respect to the deferred tax assets on allowance for doubtful accounts.\nUncertain tax positions\nThe Company evaluates each uncertain tax position (including the potential application of interest and penalties) based on the technical merits and\nmeasures the unrecognized benefits associated with the tax positions. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not have any\nsignificant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company did not incur any interest and penalties tax for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company does not\nanticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months from December 31, 2019.\nValue added tax\nAll of the Company’s service revenues that are earned and received in the PRC are subject to a Chinese VAT. Before May 2018, the rate of\nChinese VAT is 17%, and was changed to 16% from May 2018 to March 2019, then the Chinese VAT is at a rate of 13% starting in April 2019 of\nthe gross proceeds or at a rate approved by the Chinese local government.\nTaxes payable consisted of the following:\nDecember 31, December 31,\n2019 2018\nVAT taxes payable $ 2,507,683 $ 1,314,320\nIncome taxes payable 833,476 514,349\nOther taxes payable 183,994 113,101\nTotals $ 3,525,153 $ 1,941,770\nF-30\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n15. CONCENTRATION OF RISK\nCredit risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash (including\nrestricted cash and certificate deposits). As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, $15,478,337, $11,828,316 and $19,760,244 were deposited\nwith financial institutions located in the PRC, respectively. These balances are not covered by insurance. While management believes that these\nfinancial institutions are of high credit quality, it also continually monitors their credit worthiness.\nThe Company is also exposed to risk from its accounts receivable and other receivables. These assets are subjected to credit evaluations. An\nallowance has been made for estimated unrecoverable amounts which have been determined by reference to past default experience and the\ncurrent economic environment.\nA majority of the Company’s expense transactions are denominated in RMB and a significant portion of the Company and its subsidiaries’ assets\nand liabilities are denominated in RMB. RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. In the PRC, certain foreign exchange transactions\nare required by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People’s Bank of China (“PBOC”).\nRemittances in currencies other than RMB by the Company in China must be processed through the PBOC or other China foreign exchange\nregulatory bodies which require certain supporting documentation in order to affect the remittance.\nOur functional currency is the RMB, and our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC\nor U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future. The change in the value of the RMB\nrelative to the U.S. dollar may affect our financial results reported in the U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying changes in our\nbusiness or results of operations. Currently, our assets, liabilities, revenues and costs are denominated in RMB.\nTo the extent that the Company needs to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes,\nappreciation of RMB against U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount the Company would receive from the conversion.\nConversely, if the Company decides to convert RMB into U.S. dollar for the purpose of making payments for dividends, strategic acquisition or\ninvestments or other business purposes, appreciation of U.S. dollar against RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available\nto the Company.\nCustomer concentration risk\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, two customers under the same ownership accounted for 12.1% of the Company’s total revenues. For the\nyear ended December 31, 2018, two customers under the same ownership accounted for 10.8% of the Company’s total revenues. For the year\nended December 31, 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2019, two customers under the same ownership accounted for 15.1% of the total balance of accounts receivable. As of\nDecember 31, 2018, two customers under the same ownership accounted for 10.8% of the total balance of accounts receivable. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017, no customer accounted for more than 10% of the total balance of account receivable.\nVendor concentration risk\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, two vendors accounted for 54.84% and 31.53% of the Company’s total purchases. For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2018, two vendors accounted for 49.2% and 43.6% of the Company’s total purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three\nvendors accounted for 35.3%, 27.4% and 26.1% of the Company’s total purchases.\nAs of December 31, 2019, one vendor accounted for 14% of the total balance of accounts payable. As of December 31, 2018, two vendors\naccounted for 62.4% and 17.1% of the total balance of accounts payable. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three vendors accounted for\n39.5%, 25.4% and 25.2% of the total balance of account payable.\nF-31\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n16.

After completion of the IPO, 141,114 ordinary shares were issued on August 8, 2019, pursuant to the underwriter’s partial exercise of its\noption to purchase additional ordinary shares, resulting in gross proceeds of $564,456, before underwriting discounts and commissions and\noffering expenses.

Relevant PRC\nstatutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by Blue Hat WFOE, Blue Hat Fujian, Blue Hat Hunan and Blue Hat Shenyang\n(collectively “Blue Hat PRC entities”) only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and\nregulations. The results of operations reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP\ndiffer from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of Blue Hat PRC entities.\nBlue Hat PRC entities are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds until\nsuch reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital. In addition, Blue Hat PRC entities may allocate a portion of their after- tax profits based on\nPRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion fund and staff bonus and welfare fund at its discretion. Blue Hat PRC entities may allocate a\nportion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to a discretionary surplus fund at its discretion. The statutory reserve funds and\nthe discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company out of China is\nsubject to examination by the banks designated by State Administration of Foreign Exchange.\nAs a result of the foregoing restrictions, Blue Hat PRC entities are restricted in their ability to transfer their assets to the Company. Foreign\nexchange and other regulation in the PRC may further restrict Blue Hat PRC entities from transferring funds to the Company in the form of\ndividends, loans and advances. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, amounts restricted are the paid-in-capital and statutory reserve of Blue\nHat PRC entities, which amounted to $14,154,734, $14,043,401 and $13,778,708, respectively.\nStatutory reserve\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Blue Hat PRC entities collectively attributed $111,333, $264,693 and $530,869 of\nretained earnings for their statutory reserves, respectively.\nCapital contributions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company’s shareholders contributed $7,942,021, $0, and $8,772,355 to the\nCompany.\nF-32\nBLUE HAT INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT TECHNOLOGY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n17.

As\nof December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s commitment under these agreements amounted to $7,815,143 and $1,221,196, respectively.\nVariable interest entity structure\nIn the opinion of management, (i) the corporate structure of the Company is in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations; (ii) the\nContractual Arrangements are valid and binding, and do not result in any violation of PRC laws or regulations currently in effect; and (iii) the\nbusiness operations of Blue Hat WFOE and the VIEs are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations in all material respects.\nHowever, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations.\nAccordingly, the Company cannot be assured that PRC regulatory authorities will not ultimately take a contrary view to the foregoing opinion of\nits management. If the current corporate structure of the Company or the Contractual Arrangements is found to be in violation of any existing or\nfuture PRC laws and regulations, the Company may be required to restructure its corporate structure and operations in the PRC to comply with\nchanging and new PRC laws and regulations. In the opinion of management, the likelihood of loss in respect of the Company’s current corporate\nstructure or the Contractual Arrangements is remote based on current facts and circumstances.\nRisk of uncertainty\nThe Company expects revenue in the first quarter of 2020 to decrease 40% to 50% due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the\nCompany's sales and operations.\nThe above outlook is based on information available as of the date of this report and reflects the Company's current and preliminary expectations\nand estimates, which are all subject to change.
