Announces Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results\n\nNovember 26, 2024 at 4:05 PM EST\n\n[PDF Version](/node/16001/pdf)\n\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ambarella, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMBA), an edge AI semiconductor company, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2025 ended October 31, 2024.\n\n  * Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $82.7 million, up 63% from $50.6 million in the same period in fiscal 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, revenue was $200.9 million, up 15% from $174.9 million for the nine months ended October 31, 2023.\n  * Gross margin under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 60.6%, compared with 59.3% for the same period in fiscal 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, GAAP gross margin was 60.7%, compared with 60.6% for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. \n  * GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $24.1 million, or loss per diluted ordinary share of $0.58, compared with GAAP net loss of $41.7 million, or loss per diluted ordinary share of $1.04, for the same period in fiscal 2024. GAAP net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was $96.9 million or loss per diluted ordinary share of $2.36. This compares with GAAP net loss of $108.8 million, or loss per diluted ordinary share of $2.74, for the nine months ended October 31, 2023. \n\n\n\nFinancial results on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 are as follows:\n\n  * Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was 62.6%, compared with 62.6% for the same period in fiscal 2024. For the nine months ended October 31, 2024, non-GAAP gross margin was 63.0%, compared with 63.5% for the nine months ended October 31, 2023.\n  * Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $4.5 million, or earnings per diluted ordinary share of $0.11. This compares with non-GAAP net loss of $11.2 million, or loss per diluted ordinary share of $0.28, for the same period in fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP net loss for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 was $11.6 million, or loss per diluted ordinary share of $0.28. This compares with non-GAAP net loss of $23.2 million, or loss per diluted ordinary share of $0.59, for the nine months ended October 31, 2023.\n\n\n\nBased on information available as of today, Ambarella is offering the following guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending January 31, 2025:\n\n  * Revenue is expected to be between $76.0 million and $80.0 million. \n  * Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be between 61.5% and 63.0%.\n  * Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be between $49.0 million and $52.0 million.\n\n\n\nAmbarella reports gross margin, net income (loss) and earnings (losses) per share in accordance with GAAP and, additionally, on a non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial information excludes the impact of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and restructuring expense adjusted for the associated tax impact, which includes the effect of any benefits or shortfalls recognized. Non-GAAP financial information also excludes the impact of the release of a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP gross margin, net income (loss) and earnings (losses) per share for the periods presented, as well as a description of the items excluded from the non-GAAP calculations, is included in the financial statements portion of this press release.\n\nTotal cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities on hand at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $226.5 million, compared with $219.8 million at the end of the prior quarter and $222.3 million at the end of the same quarter a year ago. \n\n“Company specific factors are more than offsetting broad market weakness, and we are reporting 30% sequential revenue growth in fiscal Q3, above the high-end of our guidance range, with strength led again by our customers’ new products, especially those incorporating our higher priced AI inference processors. Edge AI revenue represented about 70% of our total revenue, establishing a new record level, and this momentum is expected to enable growth in both our IoT and Auto markets in F2025 and F2026,” said Fermi Wang, President and CEO. “With the anticipated revenue growth, we intend to drive positive operating leverage and build upon our 15 consecutive fiscal years of positive free-cash-flow.”\n\n**Quarterly Conference Call**\n\nAmbarella plans to hold a conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time today with Fermi Wang, President and Chief Executive Officer, and John Young, Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 results. A live and archived webcast of the call will be available on Ambarella’s website at [http://www.ambarella.com/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=kKF2bPSymKW0fgmwlOxC6gGLQa-7XRI3i-bdDsLFreEyaRhYZBbPZMK-Jw0JTQ8bhN-1y2uVWMxn17i4Y2fBSUVpym_tXyMggP9ZEsP_rnA=) for up to 30 days after the call.\n\n**About Ambarella**\n\nAmbarella’s products are used in a wide variety of human vision and edge AI applications, including video security, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), electronic mirror, drive recorder, driver/cabin monitoring, autonomous driving and robotics applications.

The achievement or success of the matters covered by such forward-looking statements involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those predicted or implied and reported results should not be considered as an indication of our future performance.\n\nThe risks and uncertainties referred to above include, but are not limited to, global economic and political conditions, including possible trade tariffs and restrictions; revenue being generated from new customers or design wins, neither of which is assured; the commercial success of our customers’ products; our customers’ ability to manage their inventory requirements; our growth strategy; our ability to anticipate future market demands and future needs of our customers, particularly for AI inference applications; our ability to introduce, and to generate revenue from, new and enhanced solutions; our ability to develop, and to generate revenue from, new advanced technologies, such as computer vision, AI functionality and advanced networks, including vision-language models and GenAI; our ability to retain and expand customer relationships and to achieve design wins; the expansion of our current markets and our ability to successfully enter new markets, such as the OEM automotive and robotics markets; anticipated trends and challenges, including competition, in the markets in which we operate; risks associated with global health conditions and associated risk mitigation measures; our ability to effectively manage growth; our ability to retain key employees; and the potential for intellectual property disputes or other litigation.\n\nFurther information on these and other factors that could affect our financial results is included in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for our 2024 fiscal year, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional information will also be set forth in the company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, annual reports on Form 10-K and other filings the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, copies of which may be obtained by visiting the Investor Relations portion of our web site at [www.ambarella.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=leL8Y_As6H0JbDE0Jko_Ba2TrPgY9tQzFh8PJXCu5v30dZGM52cJ4fHHfx3APm9qQfoEzxR9hkhotbfGxbn2vOmuWBLI_-_YNOW8VDeFOec=) or the SEC's web site at [www.sec.gov](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=AvkVmLCivx0dKf1Bop0iu5IBopSUS7ewPGI95cKGLRA62JLTI198Lch0r-Ua0b8tjKTtXLsDg4AoD79v677YiA==). Undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this release, which are based on information available to us on the date hereof. The results we report in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2024 could differ from the preliminary results announced in this press release.\n\nAmbarella assumes no obligation and does not intend to update the forward-looking statements made in this press release, except as required by law.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nThe company has provided in this release non-GAAP financial information, including non-GAAP gross margin, net income (loss), and earnings (losses) per share, as a supplement to the condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing the company’s financial results to assess operational performance and liquidity. The company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Further, the company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics that the company uses in making operating decisions and because the company believes that investors and analysts use them to help assess the health of its business and for comparison to other companies. Non-GAAP results are presented for supplemental informational purposes only for understanding the company’s operating results. The non-GAAP information should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\n\nWith respect to its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, the company has provided below reconciliations of its non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With respect to the company’s expectations for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, a reconciliation of non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating expenses guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable efforts on a forward-looking basis due to the high variability and low visibility with respect to the charges excluded from these non-GAAP measures. We expect the variability of the above charges to have a significant, and potentially unpredictable, impact on our future GAAP financial results.\n\n**AMBARELLA, INC.**  \n---  \n**CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS**  \n**(in thousands, except share and per share data)**  \n**(unaudited)**  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,** | **Nine Months Ended October 31,**  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \nRevenue | $ | 82,653 | $ | 50,595 | $ | 200,850 | $ | 174,858  \nCost of revenue | 32,605 | 20,612 | 78,901 | 68,894  \n**Gross profit** | 50,048 | 29,983 | 121,949 | 105,964  \n**Operating expenses:**  \nResearch and development | 58,389 | 53,702 | 169,286 | 163,060  \nSelling, general and administrative | 17,169 | 18,246 | 53,905 | 55,750  \nTotal operating expenses | 75,558 | 71,948 | 223,191 | 218,810  \nLoss from operations | (25,510 | ) | (41,965 | ) | (101,242 | ) | (112,846 | )  \nOther income, net | 2,091 | 1,900 | 6,507 | 3,923  \n**Loss before income taxes** | (23,419 | ) | (40,065 | ) | (94,735 | ) | (108,923 | )  \nProvision (benefit) for income taxes | 652 | 1,645 | 2,157 | (113 | )  \n**Net loss** | $ | (24,071 | ) | $ | (41,710) | $ | (96,892) | $ | (108,810 | )  \nNet loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders:  \nBasic | $ | (0.58 | ) | $ | (1.04 | ) | $ | (2.36 | ) | $ | (2.74 | )  \nDiluted | $ | (0.58 | ) | $ | (1.04 | ) | $ | (2.36 | ) | $ | (2.74 | )  \nWeighted-average shares used to compute net loss per share  \nattributable to ordinary shareholders:  \nBasic | 41,479,459 | 40,053,251 | 41,128,068 | 39,710,248  \nDiluted | 41,479,459 | 40,053,251 | 41,128,068 | 39,710,248  \n  \nThe following tables present details of stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs and restructuring expense included in each functional line item in the condensed consolidated statements of operations above:\n\n**Three Months Ended October 31,** | **Nine Months Ended October 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(unaudited, in thousands)**  \nStock-based compensation:  \nCost of revenue | $ | 899 | $ | 868 | $ | 2,339 | $ | 2,694  \nResearch and development | 18,637 | 17,898 | 54,653 | 54,809  \nSelling, general and administrative | 7,311 | 8,643 | 23,503 | 25,293  \nTotal stock-based compensation | $ | 26,847 | $ | 27,409 | $ | 80,495 | $ | 82,796  \n  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,** | **Nine Months Ended October 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(unaudited, in thousands)**  \nAcquisition-related costs:  \nCost of revenue | $ | 757 | $ | 757 | $ | 2,271 | $ | 2,271  \nResearch and development | — | — | — | —  \nSelling, general and administrative | 510 | 520 | 1,560 | 1,560  \nTotal acquisition-related costs | $ | 1,267 | $ | 1,277 | $ | 3,831 | $ | 3,831  \n  \n**Three Months Ended October 31,** | **Nine Months Ended October 31,**  \n---|---  \n**2024** | **2023** | **2024** | **2023**  \n**(unaudited, in thousands)**  \nRestructuring expense:  \nCost of revenue | $ | — | $ | 66 | $ | — | $ | 66  \nResearch and development | — | 672 | — | 672  \nSelling, general and administrative | — | 114 | — | 114  \nTotal restructuring expense | $ | — | $ | 852 | $ | — | $ | 852  \n  \nThe difference between GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin was 2.0% and 3.3%, or $1.7 million and $1.7 million, for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and October 31, 2023, respectively.

The vehicles’ L2+ semi-autonomous systems that have benefited from this groundbreaking radar technology include highway and urban navigation on autopilot (NOA) and automatic emergency braking (AEB), where the ultra-long detection range of over 300 meters provides more time to safely react to vehicles and other objects while traveling at highway and racetrack speeds. These systems were developed by [Lotus Robotics](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=9r1WukXP7PfNr16W6oMeNwbb_IJpQmC418MrXvpP-a3VWfsIv5gZ4yzfJezYnG763dNNtZJM9DanamzLJvRC6cNKCgJSR45R3mLCrKauSAk=), a wholly owned subsidiary of Lotus, as part of its autonomous driving platform.\n\n![Lotus-Ambarella Press Image_Final](https://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/a9581fe9-3609-42e9-8b68-de3db3fceeda/lotus-ambarella-press-image-final.png)\n\nAmbarella’s Oculii radar technology is providing ultra-fine angular resolution of one degree in both vehicles, using only six transmit and eight receive antennas on each of the vehicles’ two radar modules—more than double the resolution of the nearest 4D imaging radar competitor using the same number of antennas. This high angular resolution is important for clearly distinguishing, identifying and locating objects and people, both for nearby detection in crowded urban environments, as well as from a far distance when travelling at highway and racetrack speeds, to ensure timely and accurate avoidance and braking by the vehicles’ L2+ systems.\n\nThis high resolution, in combination with a low antenna count, also provides higher value, while significantly reducing radar system power consumption and complexity; enabling the radar modules to be fitted into the desired locations on the vehicles. This combination can only be achieved using Ambarella’s Oculii AI radar algorithms, because of their unique ability to adapt radar waveforms to the environment. In fact, other 4D imaging radars require double the number of antennas to achieve the same level of performance, and in some cases, even more; leading to at least double the power consumption.\n\n“The performance that Lotus has achieved using our Oculii 4D imaging radar technology provides evidence for the real-world benefits of our AI innovations that adapt radar waves to the surrounding environment,” said Fermi Wang, president and CEO of Ambarella. “Building on their current models’ significant achievements with edge-processed AI 4D imaging radar, Lotus is evaluating Ambarella’s centralized radar processing architecture to realize even greater ADAS and autonomous performance.”\n\nBy centrally processing raw 4D imaging radar data and fusing it at a deep level with the vehicle’s other sensor information, Ambarella’s AI software-defined architecture is capable of detecting objects over 500 meters away, while providing the ability to shift processing power among sensors and adapt to real-time driving conditions. This architecture also enables even higher angular resolution of 0.5 degrees, and an ultra-dense point cloud with tens of thousands of detection points per frame. Additionally, because Ambarella’s Oculii AI radar algorithms uniquely adapt radar waveforms to the environment, an order-of-magnitude fewer antennas is still utilized for centralized processing, maintaining reduced data bandwidth and power consumption compared to competing 4D imaging radar solutions.\n\nTest drives demonstrating Ambarella’s centralized radar processing architecture will be available during [AutoSens Europe](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=Jqsg4k7wpinxRVoJTAVSG059kcrhX0OEs3VB9DIq2kyM7B9AGqp53h_qqW0sUdyappp5U5nAZI8vwLPPs3ckyhPJo_h25gBaKnZAGCA4jxY=), taking place October 8-10th in Barcelona.
