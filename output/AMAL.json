For workplace equity, the\nBank filed proposals asking companies to release more metrics to assess diversity,\nassess reproductive rights healthcare access, and to support unions and collective\nbargaining. In total, Amalgamated Bank engaged with 20 companies.\n2023 ESG Summary 13\nIntroduction Responsible Banking Environment Social Governance Appendix\nEnvironment\n2023 ESG Summary 14\nIntroduction Responsible Banking Environment Social Governance Appendix\nClimate Goals\nOur greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction strategy is driven by the following climate targets, which have been validated by\nthe Science Based Targets initiative aligned with a 1.5°C scenario;\n• Overall 49% reduction of our total direct and indirect emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3) by year 2030, against a In 2023, we continued our\n2020 baseline.\ntradition of environmental\n• Reach absolute zero emissions in our direct operations (Scope 1 target is zero and Scope 2 target is zero) by year 2030.\nleadership by being at the\nAs a bank, we take a serious approach to reducing the climate impact of our financing.

For 2023, the\nBank has chosen to continue purchasing high quality carbon removal credits for unavoidable Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions. For Scope 3 emissions we have elected to\ndirect an equivalent amount of funds that otherwise would have been directed to credits, and instead directed those funds to policy efforts in the area of energy efficiency.\nGoing beyond a 1:1 emission compensation, we believe there is greater value per dollar in emission reductions through strategic investments in advancing policies that will\ndecarbonize the real economy in the sectors where we have significant lending exposure.\nCarbon Credit Transactions\nScope 1 and 2 (Direct) emissions have been matched with an investment in to the Boone Forestlands Improved Forest Management Project located in southeast Kentucky. The\nproject is crediting new growth and is tagged on the American Carbon Registry as a carbon Removal. The property is certified under the Forest Stewardship Counsel. This\ntransaction was supported by 3Degrees Group Inc., a certified B Corp helping companies take action on climate change.\nScope 3 operational emissions (Indirect, non-category 15), Amalgamated Bank made a contribution equivalent to $10 per ton to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient\nEconomy.

This is a reduction from 2022, primarily due to growth in the securities and PACE portfolios, which traditionally have insufficient\ndata to calculate an avoided emissions estimate. The portfolio coverage for emitting sectors increased from 89% in 2022 to 97% in 2023.\nConsistency\nOur 2023 inventories use the same methodology and operational boundaries as we used previously, but with advances in the availability and quality of data it may not always be\npossible to make full comparisons.\nRelevance\nOur 2023 inventories appropriately reflect the GHG emissions of our company based on the data available, and serve to inform decision-making for our internal climate strategy and\nfor our stakeholders.\nAccuracy\nOur 2023 inventories follow the PCAF global methodology. As far as can be judged by us and by our partners, our quantification of GHG emissions is systematically neither over nor\nunder actual emissions, and furthermore, uncertainties have been reduced as far as practicable.\nRecognition\nOur 2023 inventories used the financial control approach.\nAmalgamated Bank is committed to pursuing innovative financing for climate solutions. Property Assessed Clean Energy (“PACE”) financing is a way for property owners to finance\nsustainable upgrades to their properties, including by installing solar panels, energy- and water-efficiency upgrades, electric vehicle charging stations, seismic strengthening, and\nstorm-hardening improvements.\nIn 2023, climate solutions lending and PACE financing grew to account for nearly $2.19 billion. Amalgamated Bank will continue to drive progress through this lending theme.\nAmalgamated Bank supports legislation that allows PACE financing in more states and works with lawmakers to adopt consistent consumer protections put forth by PACE Nation, a\nleading trade association. When this happens, we can retrofit our nation’s old housing and commercial stock to create an energy-efficient built environment for future generations.\n2023 ESG Summary 21\nIntroduction Responsible Banking Environment Social Governance Appendix\nSocial\n2023 ESG Summary 22\nIntroduction Responsible Banking Environment Social Governance Appendix\nHuman Capital Management\nEmployee Engagement\nEngagement surveys are scheduled to occur every 18 months. The next survey is scheduled for September 2024. Our prior survey in\nDecember 2022 showed overall increases in employee participation, favorability (a measure of the items rated 4 or 5 by employees),\nand engagement level. Engagement-related actions have centered on culture, collaboration, compensation and benefits, resources,\nequipment, and training. Since the last survey, we have revised our corporate values and taken steps to ingrain them into our culture\nand behaviors. The hybrid work environment at each of our four hubs has allowed many of our engagement actions to be done in\nperson, building upon our culture of collaboration.\nEmployee Retention\nWe are committed to retaining top talent and building a workplace where every person can feel empowered to grow their career. We\nare pleased that in 2023, we experienced a significant decrease in regrettable turnover at 10% versus 15% in 2022. Regrettable turnover\nrefers to a measure of employees who met performance expectations who chose to voluntarily leave. We attribute this decrease to our\ncontinued focus on employee engagement-related actions and culture.\nTraining and Development\nAmalgamated Bank believes that employees should constantly grow and learn new skills. The Bank has a tuition reimbursement\nprogram and mandates employee participation in formal training courses. The Bank will reimburse certain tuition costs upon successful\ncompletion of the course, up to $5,250 annually. All full and participating part-time employees who have completed one year of\ncontinuous service, prior to beginning any reimbursable course are eligible to participate in the program.\nIn addition, staff receive access to networking opportunities as well as training in information technology, management skills, diversity\nand inclusion, data security and privacy, and other relevant skills. All colleagues have the opportunity to participate in the employee-\nowned career development process. The career development process is supported by the Bank and designed to help colleagues\ncreate a career path based on their personal aspirations. We support formal and informal mentorship opportunities under the belief\nthat mentoring programs are one of the most impactful means of growing personally and professionally, and cultivate internal talent\nfor future leadership. We expanded our partnership with The Leader’s Edge to provide leadership coaching and development for high\nperforming/high potential leaders with significant people and strategic accountabilities.\n2023 ESG Summary 23\nIntroduction Responsible Banking Environment Social Governance Appendix\nCollective Bargaining\nAmalgamated Bank has a deep history in unions and workers’ rights. Amalgamated Bank is a union-founded bank, and the union remains our largest shareholder. Thus, the\nrights of workers are a central theme of our work. We believe collective bargaining is a fundamental right. Approximately 21% of the Bank’s workforce is unionized and has\ncollective bargaining rights per agreements with the union. Those agreements include information on their rights and grievance policies. The Bank openly supports unionized\nlabor and collective bargaining. Unionization is explicitly encouraged per our Freedom of Association Policy. This policy conforms to the UN Global Compact (“UNGC”), in\naddition, our Human Rights policy was written to be consistent with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human\nRights, and the International Labor Organization’s Fundamental Conventions.\nBenefits\nOur employees are our greatest asset, and we believe that investing in their wellbeing is essential. Amalgamated Bank is committed to investing in its employees through a\ncomprehensive compensation and benefits package that includes health insurance, retirement savings plans including a pension and 401(k), employee development programs, career\nadvancement opportunities, and a focus on preserving a work/life balance. Highlights of our 2023 benefit offerings include the following:\nPaid Family Leave and Support\nThe Bank offers paid family leave, including parental and family care leave, to all eligible employees up to eight weeks. Parental leave is available to any new parent regardless of\ngender. Additionally, upon returning from parental leave, mothers have access to a private lactation room.

Amalgamated published a pay equity analysis covering its 2022 compensation year,\nexamining adjusted and median pay gaps for race and gender. The most useful view into pay equity is on an adjusted basis. In this analysis we were trying to compare like for\nlike, ensuring people are being paid equally while accounting for legitimate job-related factors that drive compensation decisions, such as job role, experience, and tenure.\nThe analysis of 2023 compensation found that there continues to be substantial parity in our adjusted pay for women and minorities. The adjusted female salary was 98 cents\non the dollar of the adjusted male compensation. Similarly, on an adjusted basis, minorities earned 98 cents on the dollar compared to non-minorities. Pay disparities in the\nfinancial sector often are more apparent when looking at total compensation, rather than simply a base salary. All of the data we are reporting is based on total pay: inclusive\nof salary, bonus, and equity awards. This reflects a best practice for pay equity disclosures. The 2022 analysis, published earlier in the year, earned the Bank an “A” on Arjuna\nCapital’s Racial and Gender Pay Scorecard, the highest score in the Financials sector.\nManagement uses this analysis as part of its approach to ensuring equity across our workforce and respecting the value of each and every team member.\n2023 Pay Ratios\nProtected Group Comparator Group Union/Non- Union Median Unadjusted Adjusted\nFemale Male Union 1.04 1.01\nFemale Male Non-Union 0.82 0.97\nFemale Male Total 0.88 0.98\nMinority Non-Minority Union 0.85 0.99\nMinority Non-Minority Non-Union 0.70 0.98\nMinority Non-Minority Total 0.74 0.98\n2023 ESG Summary 30\nIntroduction Responsible Banking Environment Social Governance Appendix\nEmployee Demographic Data\nOur disclosures align with EEO-1 reporting.
