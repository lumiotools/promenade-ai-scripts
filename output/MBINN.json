If\nyou received the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “Notice”) by mail and would like to receive\na printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in\nthe Notice.\nThe Notice is first being mailed to shareholders and we intend to provide access to the proxy materials to\nthe shareholders of record beginning on or about April 5, 2024.\nThis Proxy Statement and our Annual Report are available at:\ninvestors.merchantsbancorp.com\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nTime and Date: 8:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on Thursday, May 16, 2024\nPlace: Merchant Bancorp’s headquarters, 410 Monon Blvd., Carmel, Indiana 46032\nRecord Date: March 22, 2024\nVoting: Only holders of our common stock as of the Record Date are entitled to vote. Each share\nof common stock is entitled to one (1) vote for each director nominee and one (1) vote for\neach of the other proposal being voted on.\nPROPOSALS TO BE VOTED ON AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nProposal Recommendation Page Reference for More Detail\nElection of Directors FOR each nominee 11\nCompensation of our Named Executive Officers FOR 32\nRatification of the appointment of FORVIS, LLP FOR 37\nas our registered independent public accounting firm\nfor the year ending December 31, 2024\n1\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING\nThe following is information regarding the Annual Meeting and the voting process, presented in a question and\nanswer format.\nWhy did you receive access to the proxy materials?\nWe have made the proxy materials available to you because, as of the Record Date, you held shares of our\ncommon stock. This proxy statement describes the proposals that will be presented for consideration by the\nshareholders at the Annual Meeting. It also provides information concerning those proposals to assist you in making\nan informed decision.\nWhy did you receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of paper copies\nof the proxy materials?\nWe are using the SEC notice and access rule that allows us to furnish our proxy materials on the internet to\nour shareholders instead of mailing paper copies of those materials to each shareholder. As a result, beginning on or\nabout April 5, 2024, we sent our shareholders the Notice by mail with instructions on how to access our proxy\nmaterials on the internet and vote online. The Notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If\nyou received the Notice this year, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless you request the\nmaterials by following the instructions on the Notice or on the website referred to in the Notice.\nWho may vote at the Annual Meeting?\nThe proxy materials are provided to holders of record of our common stock on the Record Date. Only the\ncommon shareholders of record on the Record Date may vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there\nwere 43,354,718 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nHow can you vote?\nYou may own your shares of our common stock in one or more of the following ways:\n• Directly in your name as shareholder of record; or\n• Indirectly through a broker, bank, or other holder of record (your “nominee”), commonly referred\nto as in “street name.”\nFor shares of which you are the shareholder of record, you may vote your shares on the internet, by\ntelephone, or by requesting a proxy card and completing, signing, and returning it in the postage-paid envelope that\nwill be provided. Simply follow the instructions provided on the Notice or proxy card. You may also vote during the\nAnnual Meeting. Execution of a proxy card or voting via the internet or by telephone will not affect your right to\nattend the Annual Meeting.\nHowever, if your shares are held in street name, please follow the instructions provided by your nominee\non the voting instruction form or Notice in order to vote your shares. The method by which you may vote your\nshares (e.g., by internet or telephone) may depend on the voting process of your nominee. If you desire to vote at the\nAnnual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your nominee. Please contact your nominee for instructions\nregarding obtaining a legal proxy. As provided above, the Annual Meeting will be in person and there will not be a\nvirtual meeting.\nWhat happens if you do not give specific voting instructions?\nShareholders of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and you (a) indicate when voting on the internet\nor by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board or (b) sign and return a proxy card without\ngiving specific voting instructions, then the persons named as proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner\nrecommended by the Board on all proposals presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may\ndetermine in their judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting.\nShares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in street name and you do not provide your nominee\nwith specific voting instructions, then, under applicable rules, your nominee may generally vote on routine matters\nbut cannot vote on non-routine matters. If your nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your\nshares on a non-routine matter, your nominee will inform us that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter\nwith respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.” For the Annual Meeting, each of the\n2\nelection of directors and say-on-pay advisory vote are considered a non-routine matter but the ratification of the\nappointment of our independent registered public accounting firm is considered a routine matter.\nCan you change your vote after you return the proxy card or after voting electronically?\nIf you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before it is\nvoted. Prior to the applicable cutoff time, you may change your vote using the internet, in which case only your\nlatest internet proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted. You may also revoke your proxy and\nchange your vote by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form dated as of a later date, or by\nattending the meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the meeting will not automatically revoke\nyour proxy unless you properly vote at the Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked\nby delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary prior to the Annual Meeting.\nIf you hold your shares in street name, you may revoke your proxy by following instructions provided by\nyour nominee.\nNo notice of revocation or later-dated proxy will be effective until received by our Secretary at or prior to\nthe Annual Meeting.\nWhat options do you have in voting on each proposal?\nYou may vote “FOR” or “WITHHOLD” with respect to the election of each director nominee.\nYou may vote “FOR,” “AGAINST,” or “ABSTAIN” with respect to the say-on-pay advisory vote, the\nratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and any other matter that may\nproperly be brought before the meeting.\nWhat is the quorum required for each proposal?\nThe holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the Record Date, represented\nin person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for purposes of such proposal at the Annual Meeting. If less than a\nmajority of the shares of our common stock are represented at the meeting, a majority of the shares represented may\nadjourn the meeting at any time.\nAs of the Record Date, there were 43,354,718 shares of our common stock outstanding. Therefore, at least\n21,677,340 shares need to be represented to constitute a quorum.\nHow many votes are needed for approval of each proposal?\nOur directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. This means that the\nnominees for director receiving the largest number of votes cast “FOR” will be elected up to the maximum number\nof directors to be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve until the Company’s 2025 annual meeting of shareholders\nand until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation, removal, or\ndeath.\nRatification of the selection of FORVIS, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm requires\nthe affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. If the appointment of FORVIS, LLP is not\nratified, the matter of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm will be considered by\nthe Board’s Audit Committee.\nHow are abstentions and broker non-votes treated?\nAbstentions and broker non-votes are counted in determining the votes present at the Annual Meeting.\nHowever, a nominee has limited authority to vote on the election of directors and say-on-pay, but is not limited as to\nthe ratification of the selection of FORVIS, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.\nWith respect to the election of directors, abstentions, broker non-votes, and votes to “WITHHOLD” for a\nnominee will result in such nominee receiving fewer votes but will not affect the outcome of the election. With\nrespect to say-on-pay and the ratification of the selection of FORVIS, LLP, abstentions and broker non-votes have\nthe same effect as a vote against the proposal.\n3\nWho will pay for the costs involved in the solicitation of proxies?\nWe will pay all costs of preparing, assembling, and distributing the proxy materials, including printing and\nmailing any copy of this proxy statement requested by a shareholder. In addition to solicitations by mail, directors\nand officers of the Company and its subsidiaries may solicit proxies personally, by telephone, email, or in person,\nbut such persons will not be specially compensated for their services.\nOther Matters Related to the Meeting\nOnly matters brought before the Annual Meeting in accordance with our Second Amended and Restated\nBy-Laws (“By-Laws”) will be considered. Aside from the items listed above in the Notice of Annual Meeting, we\ndo not know of any other matters that will be presented at the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters\nproperly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment, the proxy holders will vote them in accordance with\ntheir best judgment.\nEach of the Board’s nominees for director has consented to serving as a director of the Company. Should\nany nominee for director become unable or unwilling to accept nomination or election, the persons acting under the\nproxy intend to vote for the election of another person recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee and nominated by the Board. We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees for director will be\nunable or unwilling to serve if elected to office.\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nGenerally, the Board oversees our business and monitors the performance of our management. In\naccordance with our corporate governance procedures, the Board does not involve itself in our day-to-day\noperations, which are monitored by our executive officers and management. Our directors fulfill their duties and\nresponsibilities by attending regular meetings of the Board, with additional special meetings held from time to time.\nOur directors also discuss business and other matters with our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Petrie, and\nPresident and Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunlap, and other key executive officers, as well as our principal\nexternal advisers (legal counsel, auditors, and other consultants) at times other than regularly scheduled meetings\nwhen appropriate.\nThe Board has four (4) established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its\nresponsibilities. These committees are: Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Risk. The\nBoard also may establish such other committees as it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable laws and\nregulations and our Articles and By-Laws.\nThe Board held six (6) regularly scheduled and special meetings during 2023. In 2024, the Board intends to\nmeet at least four (4) times, with additional special meetings held from time to time when necessary, and through\ncommittee membership, which is discussed below. During 2023, all directors attended at least 75 percent of the\nmeetings of the Board and the committees on which they served. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding\ndirector attendance at the annual meeting, we encourage and expect all of our directors to attend. All of the directors\nwere present at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of shareholders.\nIn addition to meetings of the Board, our directors voluntarily attend regular meetings of management level\ncommittees to gain insight into our businesses’ current and future activities and strategies.\nDirector Independence\nUnder the rules of Nasdaq and the SEC, the Board has determined that six (6) of the current eleven\n(11) directors qualify as independent directors: Ms. Catchings, Ms. Gilroy, Mr. Juster, Mr. O’Brien, Ms. Sellers, and\nMr. Shane.\nMessrs. Petrie, Dunlap, and Evans do not qualify as independent directors because each is an executive\nofficer. Mr. Rogers does not qualify as an independent director because he is an employee. Mr. Dinwiddie does not\nqualify as an independent director because he is a partner at Dinsmore & Shohl, LLP, a law firm with which we\nhave a substantial relationship.\nA director or nominee that is not employed by us is referred to as a “Non-Executive Director.”\n4\nThe Board has a Chairman whose duties are described in our By-Laws. The Board may select any of its\nmembers as its Chairman and has no formal policy as to whether our Chief Executive Officer will serve as Chairman\nor whether any other director, including a non-employee or independent director, may be elected to serve as\nChairman. At present, the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are both held by Mr. Petrie. The Board\nbelieves that Mr. Petrie, as a co-founder, is best situated to serve as Chairman because of his familiarity with the\nCompany’s business and because he is the most capable of effectively identifying strategic opportunities and leading\nthe execution of our business strategy.\nHowever, the Board has adopted a written charter to govern in the event the positions of Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer are held by the same individual. This “Independent Lead Director Charter” was developed\nto describe the responsibilities of the Independent Lead Director if the same individual is Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer. This charter states that the Independent Lead Director will be a member of the Board who\nsatisfies the requirements for independent directors under the Nasdaq rules. Mr. Juster is our current Independent\nLead Director.\nAs described in the charter, the Independent Lead Director has responsibility for, among other things:\n• consulting with the Chief Executive Officer for Board schedules and agendas, including advising the\nChief Executive Officer as to the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the information submitted by\nMerchants’ management;\n• organizing meetings of the independent directors as necessary to, in part, ensure they have adequate\nresources for decision making and to serve as the principal liaison between the independent directors\nand the Chief Executive Officer;\n• conducting exit interviews with all departing executive officers, as appropriate; and\n• handling other such matters that are specifically delegated to the Independent Lead Director by the\nBoard from time to time.\nBoard’s Role in Risk Management\nRisk is inherent in any business; as is the case with other management functions, our senior management\nhas the primary responsibility for managing the risks we face. However, as a financial institution, our business\ninvolves financial risks that do not exist, or that are more extensive than the risks that exist, in some other types of\nbusinesses. We are subject to extensive regulation that requires us to assess and manage those risks, and our\nregulators assess our performance in that regard during their examinations. As a result, the Board is actively\ninvolved in overseeing our risk management programs.\nWhile the full Board is charged with ultimate oversight responsibility for risk management, various\ncommittees of the Board and members of management also have responsibilities with respect to our risk oversight.\nIn particular, the Audit Committee oversees and assesses our financial risk and the Risk Committee monitors our\ncredit, operational, and compliance risks, including our enterprise risk management program, and each receives\nregular reports from senior management regarding comprehensive risk as well as particular areas of concern. The\nCompensation Committee monitors and assesses the various risks associated with compensation policies and\noversees incentives that encourage a level of risk-taking consistent with our overall strategy.\nFurther, our Chairman meets regularly with senior management to discuss strategy and the risks we face.\nSenior management attends Board meetings and is available to address any questions or concerns raised by the\nBoard on risk management and any other matters.\nBoard Committees\nEach of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are comprised\nsolely of directors that meet the definition of “independent director” under the Nasdaq rules, and as to the Audit\nCommittee, also satisfy the requirements of SEC Rule 10A-3. All members of the Risk Committee are independent\ndirectors with the exception of Mr. Dinwiddie. Each committee meets at such times as determined to be necessary.\nEach committee has a written charter which sets forth the committee’s duties and responsibilities and is\nreviewed by that committee on a regular basis. The current charters of the committees are available on our website\n(investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under the corporate profile – governance documents section.\n5\nThe following table identifies the committee members.\nNominating and\nCorporate\nDirector Audit Compensation Governance Risk\nTamika D.

Shane M M M C\nNumber of Meetings in 2023 8 2 1 4\nM: Member of Committee\nC: Chair of Committee\nAudit Committee\nThe Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee also satisfies the additional\nindependence standards under the Nasdaq rules and applicable SEC rules for audit committee service and has the\nability to read and understand fundamental financial statements. In addition, the Board has determined that each of\nMr. Juster, Ms. Sellers, and Mr. Shane qualify as an “audit committee financial expert,” as that term is defined under\nthe applicable SEC rules.\nAs described in its charter, the Audit Committee has responsibility for, among other things:\n• selecting and reviewing the performance of our independent auditors and approving, in advance, all\nengagements and fee arrangements;\n• reviewing the independence of our independent auditors;\n• reviewing actions by management on recommendations of the independent auditors and internal\nauditors, including reviewing and approving the internal audit plan and budget on an annual basis;\n• meeting with management, the internal auditors, and the independent auditors to review the\neffectiveness of our system of internal control and internal audit procedures and results;\n• reviewing earnings releases, financial statements, and reports to be filed with the SEC or otherwise;\n• reviewing and approving transactions for potential conflicts of interest under our Code of Conduct; and\n• handling other such matters that are specifically delegated to the Audit Committee by the Board from\ntime to time.\nCompensation Committee\nAs described in its charter, the Compensation Committee has responsibility for, among other things:\n• overseeing executive compensation and management succession plans; personnel policies, benefits\nprograms, and incentive compensation as they relate to our executive officers; and ensuring the\ncompetitiveness thereof;\n• establishing performance goals and objectives relative to the compensation of our executive officers;\n• determining the annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer;\n• recommending to the Board the compensation of all other executive officers, including annual base\nsalary, annual or short-term incentive opportunities, long-term incentive opportunities, employment,\nseverance, and/or change-in-control agreements, and any perquisites or special benefits;\n• reviewing the talent development and executive succession planning process with our Chief Executive\nOfficer;\n• preparing the Compensation Committee report that may be required by SEC rules to be included in our\n6\nannual reports and proxy statements; and\n• handling such other matters that are specifically delegated to the Compensation Committee by the\nBoard from time to time.\nWhile the Compensation Committee maintains the authority to engage any compensation consultant at any\ntime as it deems necessary or appropriate, it generally has not engaged outside compensation consultants in\ndetermining or recommending the amount or form of executive officer or director compensation. Instead, the\nCompensation Committee has primarily relied on publicly available data and internal resources, such as our human\nresources department. However, as discussed further in the Compensation and Discussion Analysis section below, in\nJune 2022, the Compensation Committee engaged Aon’s Human Capital Solutions practice, a division of Aon plc\n(“Aon”), as its independent compensation consultant and to conduct a review of our executive compensation\namounts and structure, and advise our Compensation Committee on its decisions and recommendations for 2023.\nDuring 2023, Aon provided services related to director compensation (as discussed in Director Compensation\nbelow) but did not provide any services with respect to executive compensation.\nExecutive officers may participate in discussions with the Compensation Committee regarding our\ncompensation practices. The Compensation Committee regularly requests recommendations from and then has\ndiscussions with Messrs. Petrie and Dunlap, regarding other executive officers’ compensation. However, no\nexecutive officer is present during the Compensation Committee’s vote on such executive officer’s compensation.\nAdditionally, on an annual basis, the Compensation Committee reviews the material incentive compensation plans\nfor non-executive employees to help ensure that the proper behavior is being encouraged and payouts align with our\nactual financial results.\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee.\nAs described in its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has responsibility for,\namong other things:\n• recommending persons to be selected by the Board as nominees for election as directors or to fill any\nvacancies on the Board;\n• monitoring the functioning of our standing committees and recommending any changes, including the\ncreation or elimination of any committee;\n• reviewing and assessing the standard for determining director independence consistent with the\nrequirements of applicable laws, regulations, and the Nasdaq rules;\n• annually assessing the independence of directors and recommending action to the Board to effect\nchanges in incumbent directors (if deemed appropriate by the Committee);\n• recommending to the Board on an annual basis an independent director to serve as Chairman or Lead\nIndependent Director, as applicable;\n• reviewing shareholder proposals properly submitted, including any proposed amendments to our\nArticles or By-Laws; and\n• generally advising the Board on corporate governance matters, including reviewing and assessing the\nCompany’s compliance with the requirements of applicable laws, regulations, including state and\nfederal banking laws and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Nasdaq rules.\nAdditionally, as provided for in its charter, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has\nthe power and authority to conduct certain activities as it deems appropriate, including:\n• advising and making recommendations to the Board on the appropriate size and composition of the\nBoard; and\n• making recommendations to the Board with respect to the qualifications and independence of members\nof the Board, committee member qualifications, and committee structure and operations.\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not currently have any specific minimum\nrequirements for a nominee recommended by it. Additionally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee does not currently have a policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director\n7\nnominees. However, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee works diligently to ensure that it has\nidentified and recommended nominees that will provide appropriate oversight and bring a variety of perspectives,\nwhether from personal or business experiences.\nRisk Committee\nAs described in its charter, the Risk Committee has responsibility for, among other things:\n• establishing the strategy, policy-setting, centralized oversight, communication, and reporting to\nmanagement and the Board regarding our Enterprise Risk Management Program;\n• exercising oversight and monitoring of major risk types (i.e., strategic, credit, operational, fraud,\ncompliance, reputational, interest rate, and market risks) against established key risk indicators and risk\ntolerances to monitor the direction and potential trends, including risk mitigation efforts;\n• reviewing management’s risk management framework and associated procedures for effective\nidentification and oversight of the major risk types;\n• making periodic reports to the Board and coordinating with other Board-level and management-level\ncommittees, as appropriate, concerning risk management issues within the other committees’\nrespective areas of responsibility; and\n• reviewing results of examinations by regulatory agencies, including any significant observations or\ncommunications by regulatory agencies, and reviewing and monitoring management’s response to\naddress reported issues.\nShareholder Communication with the Board, Nomination, and Proposal Procedures\nGeneral Communications with the Board. Shareholders may contact the Board by contacting our\nSecretary, Terry A. Oznick, at 410 Monon Boulevard, Carmel, Indiana 46032 or (317) 569-7420.\nNominations of Directors.

We did not receive any shareholder nominations for director.\nThe shareholder’s notice to the Secretary must include: (a) the name and address of record of the\nnominating shareholder; (b) a representation that the nominating shareholder is a holder of record of shares of the\nCompany entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the\npersons specified in the notice; (c) the name, age, business and residence addresses, and principal occupation or\nemployment of each nominee; (d) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the nominating\nshareholder and each nominee and any other person (naming such person) pursuant to which the nominations are to\nbe made by the nominating shareholder; (e) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by such\nnominating shareholder as is required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the\nSEC, as in effect; and (f) the consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected.\nOther Shareholder Proposals. In accordance with our By-Laws, for proposals to be otherwise brought by\na shareholder and voted upon at an annual meeting of shareholders, the shareholder must give written notice of the\nproposal to our Secretary, at the above address, which must be received not less than 90 days nor more than\n120 days prior to the annual meeting.

We did not receive any shareholder proposals.\nThe shareholder’s notice to the Secretary must include: (a) a brief description of the proposal desired to be\nbrought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting; (b) the name and address of\nrecord of the shareholder proposing such business; (c) the number of shares of our common stock beneficially\nowned by such shareholder on the date of such shareholder’s notice; and (d) any financial or other interest of such\nshareholder in the proposal.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNo member of our Compensation Committee (a) is or has ever been an employee of ours; (b) was, during\n2023, a participant in any related party transaction requiring disclosure under Certain Relationships and Related\nParty Transactions, except with respect to loans made to such committee members in the ordinary course of\nbusiness on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated\nparties; or (c) had, during the last completed fiscal year, any other interlocking relationship requiring disclosure\nunder applicable SEC rules.\nCode of Conduct\nWe have a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our directors, executive officers, and employees. The\nCode of Conduct sets forth the standard of ethics that we expect all of our directors, executive officers, and\nemployees to follow. Our Code of Conduct is available on our website (investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under the\ncorporate profile – governance documents section. In accordance with SEC rules, we intend to disclose on the\ngovernance documents section of our website any amendments to the Code of Conduct, or any waivers of its\nrequirements, that apply to our executive officers to the extent such disclosure is required.\nBoard Diversity\nThe following table summarizes each director’s self-identified diversity characteristics:\nBoard Diversity Matrix of Merchants Bancorp as of March 22, 2024\nTotal Number of Directors 11\nPart I: Gender Identity\nFemale Male\nDirectors 3 8\nPart II: Demographic Background\nAfrican American or Black 1 0\nWhite 2 8\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\nThe following table provides the compensation received by our Non-Executive Directors during the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023.

The February installment was\nbased on a closing price of $30.63 on February 15, 2023, the May installment was based on a closing price of $23.80\non May 17, 2023, the August installment was based on the closing price of $30.10 on August 16, 2023, and\nNovember installment was based on the closing price of $32.28 on November 14, 2023.\nDirectors’ Fees\nUnder the Compensation Committee’s charter, the Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing\nand making recommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of Non-Executive Directors. For 2023, our\nNon-Executive Directors were compensated consistent with our 2021 Director Compensation Structure described\nbelow. Each of our directors also serves as director of our wholly owned subsidiary, Merchants Bank of Indiana\n(“Merchants Bank”).\nIn late 2020, our Chairman recommended to the Compensation Committee that there be a review of the\noverall compensation, including total amount and structure, for Non-Executive Directors. The Chairman’s\nrecommendation was based on a variety of factors, including that the most recent review of director compensation\nwas in early 2018, shortly after our 2017 initial public offering, that it is in the best interest of our shareholders to\nensure that that we are able to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on the Board, and that Non-Executive\nDirector compensation be commensurate with the level of responsibility and expectations placed on the Board.\nFollowing the Chairman’s recommendation, the Compensation Committee conducted a thorough review of\nNon-Executive Director compensation. The Compensation Committee reviewed the compensation structure for the\nboards of directors of the same peer group as used by the Compensation Committee at that time to review executive\ncompensation and the compensation structure for the boards of directors of other publicly traded companies based in\nthe Indianapolis area. Although the other publicly traded companies based in the Indianapolis area may not\nnecessarily compete with us for financial services, they may compete with us for the services of individuals to serve\non their boards of directors. Additionally, the Compensation Committee discussed our strategic objectives, growth,\nand other relevant circumstances with Mr. Petrie, Mr. Dunlap, and our General Counsel, Terry A. Oznick.\nIn early 2021, the Compensation Committee completed its review and recommended to the Board certain\nchanges to our Non-Executive Director compensation. The Board then considered and ultimately adopted those\nrecommendations and the changes to became effective immediately following the Company’s 2021 annual meeting\nof shareholders. This “2021 Director Compensation Structure” provides for Non-Executive Directors to receive:\n• $100,000 annual retainer, comprised of $50,000 in cash and a number of shares of restricted common\nstock equal to $50,000, to be paid in equal quarterly installments (with each installment of common\nstock rounded up to the nearest whole share) so long as the Non-Executive Director remains on the\nBoard at the time of payment;\n• $15,000, $10,000, $7,500, and $15,000 annual cash retainer for the Chairpersons of the Audit,\nCompensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance, and Risk Committees, respectively, to be\nprorated if changes in committee leadership are made mid-year; and\n10\n• No additional compensation for service as a director of Merchants Bank or any of our other\nsubsidiaries or for attendance at any meeting.\nWe did not make any changes in the 2021 Director Compensation Structure from the time it was\nimplemented, through 2023.\nHowever, in 2023 the Compensation Committee determined it was appropriate to conduct a thorough\nreview of our Non-Executive Director compensation with the assistance of our compensation consultant, Aon. The\nCompensation Committee determined that, similar to that of our executive officers, in recent years the expectations\nand responsibilities of our Non-Executive Directors had increased, especially considering the Company’s growth in\nassets and increased complexity.\nThe Compensation Committee engaged Aon, who in August 2023 provided certain reports regarding the\ncompensation of the board of directors of our current peer group (provided below in Executive Compensation). The\nCompensation Committee believed that this peer group was appropriate for reviewing director compensation as well\nas executive compensation because directors in the peer group are more likely to be responsible for overseeing\norganizations that engage in similar business activities, have portions of their business activities that are more\ncomplex than traditional bank holding companies, and are subject to a similar level of regulatory scrutiny. Among\nother information provided in its reports, Aon provided details on the total amounts and cash and equity proportions\nof retainers for directors generally, as well as committee chairs and lead independent directors, where applicable.\nThese reports provided that in we were in the bottom tenth percentile in our peer group in each of total\ncompensation and the amounts of cash and equity paid to directors.\nThe Compensation Committee also reviewed the compensation structure for the boards of directors of other\npublicly traded companies based in the Indianapolis area, which, as noted above, may not necessarily compete with\nus for financial services but may compete with us for the services of individuals to serve on their boards of directors.\nOur directors’ total compensation ranked among the bottom of Indianapolis based publicly traded companies.\nAdditionally, the Compensation Committee discussed our strategic objectives, growth, and other relevant\ncircumstances with Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, and Oznick.\nUpon the completion of its review in November 2023, the Compensation Committee believed it was\nappropriate to make changes to the director compensation structure and recommended the below “2024 Director\nCompensation Structure” to the Board.\n• Compensation for service on the Board will only be paid to Non-Executive Directors.\n• No additional compensation for service as a director of Merchants Bank or any of our other\nsubsidiaries or for attendance at any meeting.\n• A $140,000 annual retainer, comprised of $70,000 in cash and a number of shares of restricted\ncommon stock equal to $70,000, to be paid in equal quarterly installments (with each installment of\ncommon stock rounded up to the nearest whole share) so long as the Non-Executive Director remains\non the Board at the time of payment.\n• $17,500 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Audit Committee.\n• $17,500 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Risk Committee.\n• $12,500 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Compensation Committee.\n• $10,000 annual cash retainer for the chair of the Board’s Nominating and Corporate Governance\nCommittee.\n• If the Company’s positions of Chair and Chief Executive Officer are held by the same person and the\nBoard has elected a Lead Independent Director, $15,000 annual cash retainer for the Lead Independent\nDirector.\n• Committee Chair and Lead Independent Director retainers will be prorated if there is any change in\nsuch position between annual meetings of shareholders.\nThe Board reviewed the Compensation Committee’s recommendation and approved the 2024 Director\nCompensation Structure in November 2023 and it became effective in January 2024.\n11\nPROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS\nAt the Annual Meeting, shareholders entitled to vote will elect eleven (11) directors to serve until our 2025\nannual meeting of shareholders and until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified, or until his or her\nearlier resignation, removal, or death.

Petrie, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer;\n• Michael J. Dunlap, President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company and President and Chief\nExecutive Officer of Merchants Bank;\n• Michael R. Dury, President and Chief Executive Officer of Merchants Capital;\n16\n• John F. Macke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and\n• Martin A. Schroeter, President – Warehouse Lending.\nRegulatory Impact on Compensation\nAs a publicly traded financial institution, we are subject to various regulations when considering and\nimplementing compensation-related decisions. Although these regulations do not set specific parameters within\nwhich compensation decisions must be made, they do require that we be mindful of the risks associated with\ncompensation programs designed to incentivize the achievement of better than average performance.\nIn particular, the federal bank regulators, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”),\nhave long held that excessive compensation is prohibited as an unsafe and unsound practice. In describing a\nframework to determine whether compensation is excessive, the FDIC has indicated that financial institutions should\nconsider whether aggregate cash amounts paid, or noncash benefits provided, to employees are unreasonable or\ndisproportionate to the services performed by an employee. The FDIC encourages financial institutions to review an\nemployee’s compensation history and to consider internal pay equity, and, as appropriate, to consider benchmarking\ncompensation to peer groups. Finally, the FDIC provides that, in order to give proper context, such an assessment\nmust be made in light of the institution’s overall financial condition.\nAdditionally, we must also take into account the joint agency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation\nPolicies, which sets forth a framework for assessing and mitigating risk associated with incentive compensation\nplans, programs, and arrangements maintained by financial institutions.\nOther matters, such as accounting, tax, and SEC requirements regarding risk assessment are also considered\nby the Compensation Committee and Board as part of its compensation design and annual decisions.\nThe SEC adopted final “clawback” rules in October 2022, as directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, which\nNasdaq implemented in 2023. In November 2023, we revised our clawback policy and it, among other things,\nrequires that we recover excess incentive-based compensation from executive officers if we are required to prepare\nan accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under securities\nlaws. A copy of our clawback policy can be found on our website (investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under the\ncorporate profile – governance documents section.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nWhile we are headquartered in and most of our executive officers are located in Indiana, we compete and\nmeasure our performance on both local and national levels. We strive to be among the top performing banks in the\nnation. Our compensation philosophy reflects this strategy and expectation. In establishing our executive\ncompensation program, the Compensation Committee considers the practices of our peers, but does not set\ncompensation at a specific percentile of our peers. Instead, the Compensation Committee views peer data as one tool\navailable to them for consideration, along with market conditions and the executive officer’s current and future\nresponsibilities, among other factors.\nWe structure our executive compensation program to align with our overall expectations and to motivate\nour NEOs to drive actual results, but at the same time not encourage excessive risk taking behaviors. In particular:\nWhat We Do What We Do Not Do\n• Consider peer group information in • Provide for single-trigger payments\ncompensation decisions upon change in control\n• Only provide for double-trigger severance • Reprice equity awards\npayments upon a change in control\n• Vest equity awards ratably over multiple years • Provide tax gross-ups\n• Tie equity awards to overall Company • Guarantee cash awards – incentive\nperformance using measures that are compensation may be reduced to zero if\nimportant to shareholders (e.g., revenue, threshold performance measures are not\nreturn on equity, and earnings per share) met\n17\nPrior Year’s Say-on-Pay Vote\nAt our 2023 annual meeting, our shareholders had the opportunity to provide a non-binding, advisory vote\non the compensation paid to our NEOs, or a “say-on-pay” vote, for the first time. Over 84 percent of the votes cast\nby our shareholders were in favor of the compensation provided to our NEOs. This result affirmed majority\nshareholder support of our approach to executive compensation, and informed the Compensation Committee’s\ndiscussions during the year, which resulted in no significant changes.\nAdditionally, at our 2023 annual meeting, our shareholders had the opportunity to provide a non-binding,\nadvisory vote on the frequency of our say-on-pay vote, for the first time. Over 98% of the votes cast by our\nshareholders were in favor of having a say-on-pay vote every year. In recognition of that vote, a non-binding,\nadvisory say-on-pay vote will occur at the Annual Meeting so that any shareholder concerns about executive pay can\nbe acknowledged and considered in a timely manner.\nThe Compensation Committee will continue to consider the results from this year’s say-on-pay advisory\nvote and future advisory votes on executive compensation and any related feedback received from our shareholders\nvia other channels when making its compensation decisions.\nGeneral Discussion of Board, Compensation Committee, and Executive Roles in Compensation Decisions\nThe Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility for evaluating the compensation plans and\npractices for all of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and determines the\ncompensation of our Chief Executive Officer and makes a recommendation to the Board for the compensation of our\nother NEOs.\nThe Compensation Committee generally completes its annual review in January following the fiscal year-\nend and meets in that same month to determine the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and make\nrecommendations to the Board regarding the compensation of our other NEOs for the upcoming fiscal year, in each\ncase including both the specific components and amounts of such compensation. In determining the Chief Executive\nOfficer’s compensation and making recommendations to the Board regarding the other NEOs’ compensation, the\nCompensation Committee members meet with members of senior management and review materials prepared by\nboth the Company and third parties to, among other reasons, ensure that the Compensation Committee understands\nthe NEO’s current role and future plans the Company may have for such NEO and the broader market for such\nNEO’s services. Additionally, the Compensation Committee solicits input from Mr. Petrie and Mr. Dunlap,\nincluding their assessment of each NEO’s performance and contributions to the Company’s strategic objectives.\nHowever, no NEO is present during the Compensation Committee’s deliberation or vote to approve any\nrecommendation to the Board regarding any NEOs’ compensation.\nThe Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing the target performance measures for all cash\nincentive awards and equity incentive awards and the payout ranges therefor for all NEOs. The Compensation\nCommittee believes that including payout ranges is more in line with market practice and provides proper incentive\nfor outstanding performance, without encouraging overly risky behavior. Additionally, for the equity incentive\nawards, the Compensation Committee generally uses the closing share price of the Company’s common stock on\nDecember 31st of the prior fiscal year (or other date that is the last trading day of that year) for determining the\namount of the payout. The Compensation Committee believes that using such date takes into account the Company’s\nperformance through the fiscal year and more closely aligns the NEOs’ awards to the shareholders’ return.\nCompensation Consultants\nThe Compensation Committee’s charter gives it the authority to hire consultants to further its objectives\nand responsibilities. Historically, the Compensation Committee’s practice has been to not hire any consultants. This\nis largely because in the Board’s experience it has been difficult for consultants and similar third parties to fully\nunderstand our business model, which is unlike most traditional banks, or find appropriate peer institutions or find\nother executive officers whose roles align with those of our executive officers. Instead, the Compensation\nCommittee has generally relied upon market data provided by internal parties that the Compensation Committee\ndeems reasonable and appropriate, including our internal human resources department, and survey data from\nindustry resources. However, in January 2022, the Compensation Committee determined that it would be\nappropriate and helpful to the Compensation Committee to hire a consultant to review current compensation\npractices and levels and make recommendations for 2023.\nAfter issuing a request for proposal and considering bids for services from several compensation\n18\nconsultants, in June 2022 the Compensation Committee hired Aon as its independent compensation consultant. The\nCompensation Committee believed that Aon had the best grasp of our business and the mortgage banking business\ngenerally, had the best data available, and would be best equipped to review our current practices and make\nrecommendations that would be useful both immediately and long-term. In its engagement of Aon, the\nCompensation Committee considered the independence of its compensation advisors under applicable SEC and\nNasdaq listing rules and concluded there was no conflict of interest with respect to this engagement.\nAon’s specific services to the Compensation Committee included support in the Compensation\nCommittee’s effort to review our then existing peer group and develop a new peer group, if appropriate, review\npotential risks associated with our compensation programs, and analyze our executive officer compensation levels,\nincluding based on the new peer group, if one was determined to be appropriate. As part of its services, the\nCompensation Committee expected Aon to provide information that would be useful for the Compensation\nCommittee in evaluating potential changes to executive compensation for 2023, including overall compensation\namounts and compensation structures.\nDuring this review process the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to develop a\nnew peer group. In particular, the Compensation Committee noted that in recent years we have grown significantly\nmore than most of the members of that 2022 peer group, including in asset size, net income, and the complexity of\nour business model.\nIn developing an appropriate new peer group, the Compensation Committee believed it was important that\nour unique characteristics be considered. In particular, that we have a limited physical branch network but operate\nnational businesses and that we primarily offer mortgage and real estate centric products, with a particular focus on\nmultifamily mortgage banking. With Aon’s assistance, we primarily considered institutions:\n• with annual revenues between $300 million and $860 million (as of June 30, 2022);\n• with multifamily loans being more than 7% of their total loan portfolio; and/or\n• which are otherwise close competitors in geography or business model.\nIn September 2022, the Compensation Committee selected the following group of 26 publicly traded\ncompanies as its new peer group:\nBanc of California Inc. First Busey Corp.* Pacific Premier Bancorp\nBanner Corp. First Financial Bancorp Provident Financial Services\nBerkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. First Foundation Inc.* QCR Holdings Inc.\nBrookline Bancorp Inc. First Merchants Corp.* S&T Bancorp Inc.\nCustomers Bancorp Inc.* HomeStreet Inc.* The Bancorp\nCVB Financial Corp. Independent Bank Corp. TriCo Bancshares\nDime Community Bancshares Inc.* Lakeland Financial Corp.* Walker & Dunlop Inc.\nEagle Bancorp Inc NBT Bancorp Inc. Washington Federal Inc.\nEastern Bankshares Inc. OceanFirst Financial Corp.\n*denotes company that was also in our peer group in 2022.\nAfter developing this new peer group, Aon provided the Compensation Committee with certain reports\ndetailing how our executive compensation practices compared, including in total amounts of compensation, mix of\ncash and equity, and overall compensation structure. While we do not set compensation to a specific percentile of\nour peers, the Compensation Committee believed it was noteworthy that several of our NEOs were among the\nbottom tenth percentile in total compensation.\nIn December 2022, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed these reports with Aon\nrepresentatives and discussed our historical and future performance and strategic objectives with our management,\nincluding Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, and Oznick. In January 2023, the Compensation Committee established our Chief\nExecutive Officer’s 2023 compensation and made its recommendation to the Board regarding the other NEOs’ 2023\ncompensation. The Board approved such recommendations in January 2023.\n19\nCompensation Components\nWe compensate our NEOs through a combination of base salary, cash bonus awards, cash incentive\nawards, equity incentive awards, and other benefits. Our compensation packages for our NEOs focus on rewarding\nperformance as measured against established corporate goals. Additionally, in the case of Messrs. Dury and\nSchroeter we provide compensation for the performance of the lines of business they manage, Merchants Capital\nand mortgage warehouse, respectively. Each element of our NEOs’ compensation is designed to achieve a specific\npurpose and to contribute to a total package that is competitive with similar packages provided by other institutions\nthat compete for the services of individuals like our NEOs. The Compensation Committee also believes that awards\n(including commissions, in the case of Mr. Dury) that relate to the performance of the Company and/or the NEO’s\nline of business should be an equal or greater percentage than salary of a NEO’s total compensation to ensure that\nsuch NEO has appropriate levels of compensation at risk if results are not achieved and is therefore properly\nmotivated and aligned with shareholders.\nFor 2023, the Compensation Committee ultimately established, in the case of Mr. Petrie, and recommended\nto the Board, in the case of our other NEOs, the following salaries and target cash and equity incentives:\nTarget Target\nName Salary\nCash Incentive (1) Equity Incentive (2)\nMichael F. Petrie $900,000 $900,000 $900,000\nMichael J. Dunlap $800,000 $800,000 $800,000\nMichael R. Dury $300,000 - $210,000\nJohn F. Macke $400,000 $200,000 $200,000\nMartin A. Schroeter $400,000 $200,000 $200,000\n(1) This table does not include any commissions or discretionary bonuses a NEO may be eligible for which are discussed\nbelow in this CD&A.\n(2) Mr. Schroeter’s equity incentive was ultimately replaced with a discretionary cash award further described in this\nCD&A.\nThe Compensation Committee established total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average\ntotal equity as the performance measures for all cash incentive awards and equity incentive awards for each NEO.\nThe Compensation Committee established a target for each of the performance measures based on a Board approved\nbudget for 2023. Each performance measure was equally weighted, and the incentives had a payout range of 75% to\n125% of target. The Compensation Committee believes that these performance measures are meaningful and the\ntargets are challenging without encouraging excessive risk and help ensure that NEOs’ incentives are aligned with\nthe benefits and return received by shareholders.\nAfter reviewing the Compensation Committee’s recommendations, the Board approved of such\nrecommendations. However, after the conclusion of our 2023 fiscal year, the Compensation Committee\nrecommended changes to Mr. Schroeter’s compensation structure, replacing his equity incentive award with a\ndiscretionary cash award that more closely aligned his compensation to the success of our mortgage warehouse\nbusiness. The Compensation Committee believed this was appropriate considering the success of the mortgage\nwarehouse business in 2023 notwithstanding the challenging market conditions for single family mortgages caused\nby interest rates that continued to rapidly rise in 2023, among other factors. In particular, our mortgage warehouse\nsegment had net income of $73.5 million in 2023 as compared to $48.6 million in 2022, despite a decrease in single\nfamily mortgage volume across the industry of approximately 30 percent.\nBase Salary\nBase salary is the only component of compensation that is not subject to the achievement of performance or\nvesting criteria. Base salary is designed to provide a fixed level of cash compensation for performing the\nresponsibilities associated with an executive’s position. We review base salaries annually and adjust them effective\nas of January 1st of each year to take into account such factors as market changes, changes in duties, individual\nperformance, and experience.\nAs described above, after consulting with Aon and reviewing data related to our new peer group, the\nCompensation Committee determined that the total compensation of our NEOs was well below market. Considering\nthis information and each NEOs role at the company, the Compensation Committee believe it was appropriate to\n20\nincrease our NEOs’ salaries. The following table provides the salary increases for our NEOs from 2022 to 2023.\n2022 2023 Percentage\nName\nSalary Salary Increase\nMichael F. Petrie $850,000 $900,000 5.9%\nMichael J. Dunlap $650,000 $800,000 23.1%\nMichael R. Dury $260,000 $300,000 15.4%\nJohn F. Macke $325,000 $400,000 23.1%\nMartin A. Schroeter $300,000 $400,000 33.3%\nCash Bonus and Cash Incentive Awards\nIf a cash incentive award is established for a NEO, it is generally tied to our achievement of certain\nperformance measures established by the Compensation Committee for that fiscal year and generally not tied to\nindividual goals. Further, the performance measures established generally must be consistent with those permitted\nunder our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”) and the Compensation Committee is responsible for\ndetermining the level of achievement of those performance measures. For 2023, the Committee established total\nrevenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total equity as the performance measures for the cash\nincentive award.\nIf a cash incentive award is established for a NEO, in addition to establishing the relevant performance\nmeasures, the Compensation Committee establishes a target and weight for each performance measure and payout\npercentage for above target performance. Additionally, all cash incentives are conditioned upon Merchants Bank\nbeing well capitalized under applicable FDIC regulations at the end of each quarter of that calendar year.\nAs provided above in this CD&A, for 2023 cash incentive awards, the Compensation Committee\nestablished:\n• Performance Measures: total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total\nequity.\n• Weighting: equal weighting to each performance measure.\n• Payout Percentages: between 75% to 125% of target; provided, however, payouts could be\nreduced to zero percent if threshold performance measures were not met and/or Merchants Bank\nfailed to be well capitalized for any quarter in 2023.\nFor 2023, Mr. Dury did not have an established target cash incentive award. The Compensation Committee\nand Board believed that his compensation was appropriately structured in other ways to ensure that he was properly\nmotivated and aligned with shareholder interest. In particular, he was compensated with commissions on fees the\nCompany received on certain loans he was responsible for closing and also with a volume bonus based on the\noverall business generated by Merchants Capital (as further described in Executive Compensation - Employment\nAgreements below). Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Macke, and Schroeter each had a target cash incentive award\nestablished in 2023.\nAt each fiscal year-end, the Compensation Committee reviews our overall performance as compared to the\nestablished targets for the performance measures, reviews whether Merchants Bank maintained well capitalized\nstatus for each quarter, and determines whether the NEO is entitled to receive a payout of such cash incentive. For\n2023, if the 75% of target threshold for a performance measure was not met, none of Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Macke,\nand Schroeter would receive a payout with respect to the portion of their cash incentive award associated with that\nperformance measure. Also, Messrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Macke, and Schroeter would not receive a payout if Merchants\nBank was not well capitalized at the end of any quarter in 2023.\nIn January 2024, the Compensation Committee completed its review and determined we achieved the\nfollowing results and that Merchants Bank maintained well capitalized status for each quarter of 2023 and approved\nthe following payouts for cash incentive awards.\n21\nActual Percentage\nPerformance Measure Target\nResults of Target\nTotal Revenue $508,397,000 $522,508,000 103%\nEarnings Per Common Share $5.17 $5.64 109%\nReturn on Average Total Equity 16.56% 17.63% 106%\nPayout Percentage 106%\nIn addition to the target cash incentive award described above, the Compensation Committee and the Board\nhave authorized Mr. Petrie and Mr. Dunlap to make a discretionary cash bonus award to any NEOs (other than to\nthemselves or, in the case of Mr. Dunlap, to Mr. Petrie) based on exceptional individual performance (e.g.,\nperformance of business unit well beyond budget). The amount of any such cash bonus may not exceed 10% of such\nexecutive’s target total compensation, or in the case of Mr. Dunlap and Mr. Dury may not exceed $200,000, without\nthe Board’s prior approval. Mr. Petrie or Mr. Dunlap must provide the details of any such cash bonus to the\nCompensation Committee promptly after the award.\nFor 2023, neither Mr. Petrie nor Mr. Dunlap awarded any discretionary cash bonuses to any NEO.\nHowever, as provided above, the Compensation Committee recommended, and Board approved of replacing Mr.\nSchroeter’s target equity incentive with a discretionary cash bonus award. Mr. Schroeter was awarded a\ndiscretionary cash bonus of $588,000 related to the performance of our mortgage warehouse business.\nIn addition to the cash incentives and cash bonuses described above, each of our NEOs are eligible to\nreceive certain nominal cash incentive awards to the same extent as all other employees, such as for completing\ncertain training. For 2023, each NEO each received $100 in such nominal cash incentives.\nEquity Awards\nUnder our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (“2017 Plan”), we have the ability to award a variety of instruments,\nbut to date have only issued restricted stock units, with each restricted stock unit subject to vesting requirements\nestablished by the Compensation Committee. We believe that other instruments, such as options, create unnecessary\ncomplexity and do not align with the best interest of our shareholders. Additionally, we do not pay dividends or any\nother form of compensation on restricted stock units prior to vesting.\nIf an equity incentive award is established for a NEO, it is tied to our achievement of certain performance\nmeasures established by the Compensation Committee for that fiscal year. Further, the performance measures\nestablished must be consistent with those permitted under the 2017 Plan and the Compensation Committee is\nresponsible for determining the level of achievement of those performance measures.\nMessrs. Petrie, Dunlap, Dury, Macke, and Schroeter were eligible to receive an equity incentive award\nunder the 2017 Plan and had an established target award in 2023. However, as provided above, Mr. Schroeter’s\nequity incentive award was ultimately replaced with a discretionary cash bonus award. The Compensation\nCommittee established total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total equity as the\nperformance measures for all equity incentive awards in 2023.\nIn the same manner as for our cash incentives, as provided above in this CD&A, for 2023 equity awards the\nCompensation Committee established:\n• Performance Measures: total revenue, earnings per common share, and return on average total\nequity.\n• Weighting: equal weighting to each performance measure.\n• Payout Percentages: between 75% to 125% of target; provided, however, payouts could be\nreduced to zero percent if threshold performance measures were not met and/or Merchants Bank\nfailed to be well capitalized for any quarter in 2023.\nAlso in the same manner as for our cash incentives, after our fiscal year-end the Compensation Committee\nreviews our overall performance as compared to the established performance measures, reviews whether Merchants\nBank maintained well capitalized status for each quarter, and determines whether the NEO is entitled to receive a\npayout of such cash incentive. For 2023, if the 75% of target threshold for a performance measure was not met, no\n22\nNEO would receive a payout with respect to the portion of their equity incentive award associated with that\nperformance measure. Also, no NEO would receive a payout if Merchants Bank was not well capitalized at the end\nof any quarter in 2023.\nAs provided above in this CD&A, at its January 2024 meeting, the Compensation Committee determined\nthat for 2023 we achieved an average of 106% of the target performance measures, and Merchants Bank was well\ncapitalized at the end of each quarter, and therefore each of Messers. Petrie, Dunlap, Dury, and Macke received a\npayout of 106% of their respective target equity incentive award in the form of restricted stock units, rounded up to\nthe nearest whole share. Each award vests ratably over a three (3) year period, with the first portion vesting on the\nFebruary 1st after the first anniversary date of the award (i.e., for 2023 equity incentive awards, the first portion will\nvest on February 1, 2025). The Compensation Committee believes the vesting period for equity incentive awards is a\nvaluable retention tool for the services of our NEOs.\nMr. Schroeter did not receive any equity incentive compensation in 2023. The Compensation Committee\nand Board determined his compensation was appropriately structured in other ways to ensure that he was properly\nmotivated and aligned with shareholder interest. In particular, that his compensation should be primarily tied to the\nperformance of our mortgage warehouse business.\nBenefits and Other Perquisites\nOur NEOs are eligible to participate in the same benefit plans designed for all of our employees, including\nhealth, dental, vision, disability, and basic group life insurance coverage. We also provide our employees, including\nour NEOs, with various retirement benefits. Our retirement plans are designed to assist our employees in planning\nfor retirement and securing appropriate levels of income during retirement. The purpose of our retirement plans is to\nattract and retain quality employees, including executives, by offering benefit plans similar to those typically offered\nby our competitors. We generally do not provide perquisites to our NEOs with the exception of country club\nmembership dues for Mr. Petrie. These plans and perquisites are described in Executive Compensation — Benefits\nbelow.\nStock Ownership and Hedging\nWe do not currently require our directors or executive officers to maintain any particular level of ownership\nof any of our securities. However, our directors receive a portion of their retainer in the form of our common stock\nand our NEOs are each eligible to receive and/or have received in prior years, awards of restricted stock units as part\nof their compensation. Additionally, we do not currently have any prohibition on our directors, executive officers, or\nemployees hedging or pledging any securities they may own. However, all of our directors, executive officers, and\nemployees are subject to our Code of Conduct and insider trading policies and directors and executive officers in\nparticular are required to seek the approval of our General Counsel prior to engaging in any transaction in our\nsecurities.\nCOMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\nWe have reviewed and discussed the CD&A with management. Based on our review and discussion with\nmanagement, we have recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this proxy statement and in the\nCompany’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors\nof Merchants Bancorp\nPatrick D.

For Mr.\nDury, such amount relates to commissions and a volume bonus earned under his “at will” employment agreement as\ndiscussed below.\n(2) Equity awards are generally made in January of the following year based on our full year performance. For 2023, we\nawarded restricted stock units in January 2024 after the Compensation Committee reviewed our full year performance.\nThe amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock awards for the years ended December 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021 in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.\n(3) Amounts represent certain nominal incentive awards and cash incentive awards to the NEO as described in the CD&A.\n(4) For Messrs.

For Mr. Petrie, the amount consisted of a contribution under our 401(k) Plan, an allocation\nunder our ESOP, and monthly country club dues and assessments. For 2023:\nESOP 401(k) Country Club Dues and\nName Allocation ($) Contribution ($) Assessments ($)\nMichael F. Petrie 4,000 9,900 17,537\nMichael J. Dunlap 4,000 9,900 -\nMichael R. Dury 4,000 9,900 -\nJohn F. Macke 4,000 9,900 -\nMartin A. Schroeter 4,000 9,900 -\nEmployment Agreements\nWe do not have employment agreements with any of our NEOs other than an “at will” employment\nagreement with Mr. Dury and change in control agreements described below. We believe that not having employee\nagreements provides us with more flexibility and adaptability when making annual compensation decisions.\nAs of January 1, 2021, we entered into that First Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (“2021\nEmployment Agreement”) with Mr. Dury. Under the 2021 Employment Agreement, Mr. Dury receives commission\ncompensation on origination fees received by us from a particular group of Merchants Capital’s customers. He does\n24\nnot receive commission related to any mortgage servicing rights or gain on sale. Mr. Dury also receives a volume\nbonus of 5% of Merchants Capital’s total fee income (the calculation of total fee income excludes any fees received\nrelated to customers for which Mr. Dury receives a commission).\nAs part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee reviews the 2021 Employment Agreement and\nmakes a recommendation to the Board as to whether it should remain in effect. For 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee recommended that the 2021 Employment Agreement remain in effect and the Board approved of such\nrecommendation. We believe the 2021 Employment Agreement, among other things, closely associates Mr. Dury’s\ncompensation to the overall success of Merchants Capital.\nUnder the 2021 Employment Agreement, Mr. Dury receives a base salary, which may be adjusted by Mr.\nDunlap as Chief Executive Officer of Merchants Bank, earns the 5% volume bonus, and earns the following\ncommissions:\nFees on Loans to Designated Borrowers\nOriginated by Mr. Dury Commissions Earned by Mr. Dury\nUnder an amount equal to 2x base salary None\n20% of the portion of the fees that exceeds 2x\nExceed 2x base salary but less than $750,000\nbase salary but does not exceed $750,000\n25% of the portion of the fees that exceeds\nExceeds $750,000 but less than $1,000,000\n$750,000 but does not exceed $1,000,000\n30% of the portion of the fees that exceeds\nExceeds $1,000,000\n$1,000,000\nThe loan fees on which Mr. Dury earns commissions are determined in our sole discretion and do not\ninclude fees paid prior to or after closing, or fees paid by any party other than the borrower.\nThe 2021 Employment Agreement includes certain restrictive covenants, including a 12-month non-\ncompetition and non-solicitation period.\nChange in Control Agreements\nIn January 2020, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board concluded that it\nwas in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, to take reasonable steps to compensate key executives,\nincluding our NEOs other than Mr. Petrie, in the event of a change in control event. With these agreements in place,\nif we should receive takeover or acquisition proposals from third parties, we will be able to call upon these key\nexecutives for their advice and assessment of whether such proposals are in the best interests of shareholders, free of\nthe influences of their personal employment situations. The Compensation Committee determined that it would not\nbe appropriate or in the best interest of shareholders to offer a change in control agreement to Mr. Petrie, in\nparticular because of the significant amount of our common stock Mr. Petrie beneficially owns.\nEach change in control agreement contains identical terms and, in particular: (a) provides for a severance\npayment of an amount equal to two times base salary plus two times the target cash incentive award most recently\napproved by the Board in the event both (1) there is a change in control event and (2) employment is terminated by\n(i) us for any reason other than cause or (ii) by the executive with good reason, within a period between 120 days\nprior to an announcement of the change in control event and 18 months after the change in control event becomes\neffective; (b) contains customary restrictive covenants regarding confidentiality; (c) contains a clawback provision\nshould any benefit thereunder be subject to recapture under any Company policy or applicable law; and (d)\nprohibits, for a 12-month period, (1) competing with us in any commercial banking, mortgage lending, or any\nsimilar lending or banking services provided by us anywhere in, or for any person whose principal office is located\nin, any county in which we maintain an office, after receipt of their severance payment and (2) soliciting our\ncustomers or employees, regardless of whether a severance payment is received. Severance payments will be made\nonly if the executive fully releases all claims against us.\nAs part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee reviews the change in control agreements and\nmakes a recommendation to the Board as to whether they should remain in effect. For 2023, the Compensation\nCommittee recommended that the change in control agreements remain in effect and the Board approved of such\nrecommendation.\n25\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nEquity-based incentive awards are currently made under the 2017 Plan. As provided in the CD&A,\nalthough the 2017 Plan permits us to issue various types of awards, to date we have only issued restricted stock\nawards under the 2017 Plan.\nMerchants Bancorp 2017 Equity Incentive Plan\nThe 2017 Plan was adopted by the Board on June 22, 2017 and approved by our shareholders on July 5,\n2017. The 2017 Plan was designed to ensure availability of equity awards that will assist us in attracting, retaining,\nand rewarding key employees, directors, and other service providers. Pursuant to the 2017 Plan, a committee of the\nBoard (the “Committee,” for which the Compensation Committee has been appointed by the Board to serve in such\nrole) is allowed to grant awards to eligible persons in the form of qualified and non-qualified stock options,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other incentive awards. Up to 2,250,000 shares\nof common stock are available for issuance under the 2017 Plan. To date, we have issued 268,874 shares of common\nstock under the 2017 Plan.\nAwards vest, become exercisable, and contain such other terms and conditions as determined by the\nCommittee and set forth in individual agreements with the participants receiving the awards. Awards to our Chief\nExecutive Officer must have a vesting period of at least three (3) years. The 2017 Plan enables the Committee to set\nspecific performance criteria, in compliance with the United States Treasury Department’s final “Guidance on\nSound Incentive Compensation Policies,” that must be met before an award vests under the 2017 Plan. In\nestablishing criteria, the Committee must attempt to balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not\nencourage participants to expose us to unnecessary or excess risks. At least 50% of any award to the Chief\nExecutive Officer must be performance-based. An award agreement with the Chief Executive Officer also must\nstipulate that the Chief Executive Officer will hold shares of stock received for at least a 12-month period after\nvesting requirements are satisfied, unless the Chief Executive Officer incurs a termination of service, in which case\nthe holding period ends on the termination date.\nThe 2017 Plan allows for acceleration of vesting and exercise privileges of grants if a change in control\noccurs and a participant incurs a termination of service without cause following the change in control. Our awards\ndo not currently provide for vesting upon death, disability, or retirement, although it would be permitted under the\n2017 Plan. If a participant’s employment is terminated for any reason, then all unvested awards expire at the date of\ntermination, unless otherwise approved by the Committee.\nGrants of Plan-Based Awards\nThe following table provides information on the incentive compensation and equity grants awarded to our\nNEOs in 2023.

We currently withhold-\nto-cover for the tax obligations of the NEO and after withholding a number of shares equal to the NEO’s tax liability,\nonly actually issues the net number of shares.\n(3) The amount reflects the gross value realized upon vesting of restricted stock units based on the $30.05 closing price of\nour common stock on February 1, 2023 (the date all restricted stock units vested in 2023).\nPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control\nAs provided in the CD&A, we do not have employment agreements with our NEOs, with the exception of\nthe “at will” 2021 Employment Agreement with Mr. Dury, and we have entered into change in control agreements\nwith each of our NEOs except for Mr. Petrie. Other than in connection with a change in control, our NEOs are not\nentitled to any payments if their employment is terminated for any reason, including for death, disability, or\nretirement.\nThe following table provides information on the potential payments and benefits our NEOs would be\nentitled to under our compensation programs and benefits plans, including the change in control agreements, upon a\nhypothetical termination of employment as of December 31, 2023. For the purposes of estimating the value of\naccelerated vesting of equity awards, we have assumed a per share price of $42.58 based on the closing price of our\ncommon stock on December 29, 2023.\n27\nTermination, by the Company Other\nthan for Cause, or by the Executive\nfor Good Reason, in Connection with\nName Type of Payment (1) Change in Control ($) (2)(3)\nCash Severance Payment -\nMichael F.

Schroeter\nOutstanding Equity Awards 621,668\n(1) For each NEO, the cash severance payment represents a payment under their change in control agreement and the\noutstanding equity award represents amounts that would automatically vest under the 2017 Plan.\n(2) These are gross amounts payable and are subject to a reduction if such amounts would exceed certain thresholds under\nSection 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.\n(3) The amounts do not include payments and benefits to the extent they are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to\nsalaried employees generally upon termination of employment, or amounts that are fully vested under the terms of the\napplicable plan, such as accrued salary and vacation pay and distributions of plan balances under our 401(k) Plan and\nESOP.\nBenefits\n401(k) Plan. Our 401(k) Plan is designed to provide retirement benefits to all eligible full-time and part-\ntime employees (including those of our subsidiaries). The 401(k) Plan provides employees with the opportunity to\nsave for retirement on a tax-favored basis. NEOs, all of whom were eligible during 2023, may elect to participate in\nthe 401(k) Plan on the same basis as all other employees. Employees may defer between 1% and 100% of their\ncompensation to the 401(k) Plan, up to the applicable IRS limit. In 2023, for each employee we made a discretionary\ncontribution equal to 3% of an employee’s eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan each pay period regardless\nof whether such employee also contributes to the 401(k) Plan, up to the applicable IRS limit. Our contribution is in\nthe form of cash and is invested according to the employee’s current investment allocation.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan. In 2020, we established the Merchants Bancorp Employee Stock\nOwnership Plan (“ESOP”) in order to reward employees for their contributions towards our success and to help\nensure that our employees’ interests are more aligned with our shareholders. Under the ESOP, from time to time we\nmay make a contribution of newly issued shares of our common stock or cash to purchase shares of our common\nstock, which is then allocated to eligible employees. The ESOP contribution is completely funded by the Company,\nis in addition to all other wages, incentives, and benefits, and requires nothing from our employees other than their\nongoing hard work and dedication. An employee’s allocation in the ESOP vests ratably over a five (5) year service\nperiod with credit for service prior to the ESOP’s adoption. ESOP participants are entitled to vote and receive\ndividends on all shares allocated to them in the ESOP, including any portion of their respective allocation that has\nnot vested. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the ESOP to the same extent as all other employees. For 2023, we\nmade a contribution of newly issued shares of our common stock to the ESOP equal to 2% of all participants’\neligible wages. A participant’s eligible wages includes salary and commissions but excludes bonuses and other one-\ntime payments (e.g., sign-on bonus, cash bonus, cash incentive, and equity incentive awards), up to a maximum of\n$200,000. Each NEO received an allocation within the ESOP equal to $4,000 (as of December 31, 2023).\nHealth and Welfare Benefits. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our standard health and welfare\nbenefits program, which offers medical, dental, vision, life, accident, and disability coverage to all of our eligible\nemployees. We do not provide the NEOs with any health and welfare benefits that are not generally available to our\nother employees.\n28\nPerquisites. We pay monthly dues and assessments for country club memberships for Mr. Petrie, which he\nuses primarily to entertain current and prospective customers. We do not provide any other perquisites to our NEOs.\nTo date, we have not established any supplemental executive retirement plans or deferred compensation\nplans other than as described above.\nChief Executive Officer Pay Ratio\nIn the table below is a comparison of the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee\nand the annual total compensation of our CEO. In determining our median compensated employee, we used a roster\nof employees as of the close of business on December 29, 2023 (the last business day of 2023) and excluded our\nCEO. This roster included 621 employees.\nWe used base salary, commissions, cash bonuses, cash incentive awards, equity incentive awards, and\nemployer contributions to our 401(k) plan in determining total compensation. The amount of any benefit that is\ngenerally available to all employees and does not vary depending on an employee’s compensation, such as the value\nof health insurance benefits, was not included. This methodology is consistent with how we determined our CEO’s\ntotal compensation in the Summary Compensation Table above. Additionally, we annualized salaries for those\nemployees who were not employed for the full year of 2023, with the exception of temporary employees. No full-\ntime equivalent adjustments were made for part-time employees.\nMedian Employee Total Compensation $94,028\nCEO Total Annual Compensation $2,839,538\nRatio of CEO to Median Employee Compensation 30 to 1\nPay Versus Performance Table\nReturn\non\nValue of initial fixed $100 average\nAverage investment based on: Net income equity\nsummary Average\nSummary compensation compensation Peer group\nCompensation Compensation table total for actually paid Total total\ntable total for actually paid non-CEO to non-CEO shareholder shareholder\nYear CEO (1) to CEO NEOs (2) NEOs return return (3)\n(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i)\n2023 (4) $ 2,839,538 $ 4,982,645 $ 2,768,869 $ 3,191,500 $ 340 $ 109 $279,234,000 17.63%\n2022 (5) $ 1,908,889 $ 2,317,600 $ 3,038,319 $ 3,227,061 $ 192 $ 99 $219,721,000 17.21%\n2021 (6) $ 1,549,064 $ 2,159,020 $ 4,922,427 $ 5,895,969 $ 246 $ 120 $227,104,000 22.07%\n2020 (7) $1,578,683 $1,842,387 $2,984,136 $3,225,454 $ 143 $ 87 $180,533,000 25.09%\n(1) Our Chief Executive Officer for each of 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was Mr. Petrie.\n(2) Our Non-Chief Executive Officers for 2023 and 2022 were Messrs.

We have included this\nsay-on-pay for consideration at the Annual Meeting pursuant to the requirements of Section 14A of the Exchange\nAct. In a nonbinding, advisory vote on the frequency of say-on-pay votes held at our 2023 annual meeting, our\nshareholders voted in favor of conducting say-on-pay votes annually. In light of this result, and other factors\nconsidered by our Board, our Board determined that we would hold say-on-pay votes on an annual basis until the\nnext advisory vote on such frequency, which we expect to take place at our 2029 annual shareholders meeting\nAs described in more detail in the CD&A, the overall objectives of the Company’s compensation program\nhave been to align NEO compensation with the success of meeting strategic and financial goals. Shareholders are\nurged to read the CD&A, Executive Compensation, Summary Compensation Table, and other related compensation\ntables and narrative disclosure that describe the compensation of our NEOs in 2023. The Compensation Committee\nand Board believe that the information provided regarding the compensation of our NEOs in this Proxy Statement\ndemonstrates that our executive compensation program was designed appropriately and is working to maximize\nshareholder return while mitigating risk and aligning managements’ interests with our shareholders. Accordingly,\nthe Board recommends that shareholders approve the following advisory resolution:\n“RESOLVED, that Merchants Bancorp’s shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, its executive\ncompensation paid to its Named Executive Officers as disclosed and described in its 2024 Proxy Statement,\nincluding the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Executive Compensation, and Summary Compensation\nTable, and other related compensation tables and narrative disclosure.”\nApproval of this resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the\nAnnual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. While this advisory vote is required, it is not binding on our\nBoard and may not be construed as overruling any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation Committee\nwill take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation arrangements.\nThe Board recommends that you vote to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs by voting\n“FOR” this proposal.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe below table sets forth the following information as of the Record Date regarding the beneficial\nownership of our common stock for:\n• each shareholder known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock;\n• each of our directors and nominees;\n• each of our NEOs; and\n• all of our directors, nominees, and executive officers as a group.\nWe have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally\nprovide that a person is the beneficial owner of securities if such person has or shares the power to vote or direct the\nvoting of securities, or to dispose or direct the disposition of securities, or has the right to acquire such powers\nwithin 60 days. Except as disclosed in the footnotes to this table, we believe that each person identified in the table\nhas sole voting and investment power over all of the shares shown opposite such person’s name.\nThe percentage of beneficial ownership is based on 43,354,718 shares of our common stock outstanding as\nof the Record Date.\n32\nThe address for each shareholder listed in the table below is: c/o Merchants Bancorp, 410 Monon\nBoulevard, Carmel, Indiana, 46032.\nAmount and Nature of\nBeneficial Ownership (1)\nName Num ber %\n5% shareholders:\nJody J.

Our directors and executive officers are also required to furnish us with copies of all such\nSection 16(a) reports they file. These reports are available on our website (investors.merchantsbancorp.com) under\nthe filings section.\nBased on a review of these reports, and on written representations from our reporting persons, we believe\nthat all such Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors and executive officers were satisfied during\n2023 with the exception of a Form 4 for Mr. Petrie that was not filed on time for a bona fide gift of our common\nstock made by his spouse.\nCERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described in Executive\nCompensation above, the following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2023, to which we have been a\nparty in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive\nofficers, or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or their immediate family members or entities\naffiliated with them, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.\nEmployment Relationships with Related Parties\nWe employ Matt Kaercher, the son-in-law of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael J. Petrie,\nas Senior Vice President – Midwest/Correspondent Lending of Merchants Capital. Mr. Kaercher’s compensation for\n2023 totaled $1,347,092, which consisted of a base salary, production bonus, and benefits.\nPayment for Services of Related Parties\nWe retain the services of various law firms, including Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, a law firm where one of our\nnominees, Thomas W. Dinwiddie, is a partner. In 2023, Dinsmore & Shohl LLP received $9.4 million in total fees\nrelated to our businesses, primarily related to the documentation of loan originations and loan collections for\nMerchants Bank. However, of such amount, only $2.2 million was paid directly by us while the remaining $7.2\nmillion was paid by third parties, such as by borrowers in connection with closing their loans.\nOrdinary Banking Relationships\nCertain of our directors, officers, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock, and their\nassociates were customers of, and had transactions with, us in the past and additional transactions with these persons\n34\nare expected to take place in the future. All outstanding loans and commitments to loan with these persons were\nmade in the ordinary course of business, were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and\ncollateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to us, and did not involve\nmore than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. All such loans are approved by the\nboard of directors of Merchants Bank in accordance with bank regulatory requirements. Similarly, all certificates of\ndeposit and depository relationships with these persons were made in the ordinary course of business and involved\nsubstantially the same terms, including interest rates, as those prevailing at the time for comparable depository\nrelationships with persons not related to us.\nPolicies and Procedures Regarding Related Party Transactions\nTransactions by us, Merchants Bank, and certain of our other subsidiaries with related parties, are subject to\ncertain regulatory requirements and restrictions, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (which\ngovern certain transactions by Merchants Bank with its affiliates) and the Board of Governors of the Federal\nReserve System’s Regulation O (which governs certain loans by Merchants Bank to its executive officers, directors,\nand principal shareholders).\nUnder applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules, related party transactions are transactions in which we are a\nparticipant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material\ninterest. Our related parties include directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive officers, 5%\nshareholders, and the immediate family members of these persons or entities affiliated with them. In accordance\nwith our Audit Committee Charter, related party transactions are evaluated in accordance with our Code of Conduct.\nIn determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee will consider, among other\nfactors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or indirect nature of the related party’s interest in the\ntransaction, the appearance of an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer taking into\naccount the size of the transaction and the financial position of the related party, whether the transaction would\nimpair a Non-Executive Director’s independence, the acceptability of the transaction to our regulators, and the\npotential violations of other corporate policies.\nREPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\nOur management is responsible for the internal control over financial reporting. The independent\nregistered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial\nstatements and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee oversees our internal controls and\nfinancial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee has met and held discussions with\nmanagement and the independent registered public accounting firm on these matters. Management represented to the\nAudit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the\nconsolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The\nAudit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed\nby Auditing Standard 1301, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including the quality,\nand not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the\nclarity of the disclosures in the financial statements.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent\nregistered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm’s independence\nfrom us and our management. In concluding that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent,\nthe Audit Committee considered, among other factors, whether the non-audit services provided by the firm were\ncompatible with its independence.\nThe Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope\nand plans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with\nand without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of our internal control\nover financial reporting, and the overall quality of our financial reporting process.\n35\nIn performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts only in an oversight capacity. In its\noversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of our management, which has the primary\nresponsibility for financial statements and reports, and of the independent registered public accounting firm who, in\nits report, expresses an opinion on the conformity of our financial statements to accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee’s oversight does not provide it with an independent\nbasis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or\npolicies, or appropriate internal control over financial reporting designed to assure compliance with accounting\nstandards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee’s considerations and discussions\nwith management and the independent registered public accounting firm do not assure that our financial statements\nare presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, that the\naudit of our financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the Public Company\nAccounting Oversight Board, or that our independent registered public accounting firm is, in fact, “independent.”\nIn reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the\nBoard, and the Board has approved, the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC. The Audit Committee has appointed,\nsubject to shareholder ratification, FORVIS, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal\nyear ending December 31, 2024.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors\nof Merchants Bancorp\nAndrew A.
