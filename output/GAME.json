This quarter, live streaming viewership is at 8.5 billion hours watched, with a 12% year-over-year increase-the highest growth since the pandemic's peak. Key players in this resurgence include platforms like Kick and YouTube Gaming, with top creators drawing audiences worldwide.\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/f0958553-f2e1-4ce9-b17b-12678a24b334/945450/image.png?v=2)\n\n\"Live streaming is at the forefront of a broader shift in how audiences engage with entertainment,\" said **Justin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare**. \"The Stream Hatchet Q3 2024 report demonstrates that as video continues to dominate the entertainment industry and creator economy, platforms like YouTube Gaming and Kick are seizing opportunities to reshape the competitive landscape. This data underscores a trend where audience attention-and platform strategies-are diversifying, fueling innovation and growth in live streaming as a primary medium of engagement.\"\n\n**Key Findings of the Q3 2024 Report:**\n\n  1. **Overall Growth in Gaming and Esports Viewership:** Live streaming rebounded with an 8% rise in esports hours watched, fueled by tournaments such as MPL Indonesia Season 14 and LCK Summer 2024, which generated a combined 130 million hours watched. Esports now comprises one-fifth of all live-streaming viewership, underscoring its importance in the gaming sector.\n\n  2. **YouTube Gaming and Kick's Rapid Rise:** YouTube Gaming grew its viewership to 2 billion hours, marking a year-over-year increase in market share from 17% to 23%. Kick also demonstrated exponential growth, with a 163% increase in hours watched compared to last year. This growth was bolstered by prominent streamers like xQc, who shifted much of their content to Kick.\n\n  3. **Shifts in Platform Dominance:** Twitch's market share dropped to 60%, while other platforms, especially YouTube Gaming and Kick, gained ground. Facebook Live has fallen from the top five, with newer platforms like AfreecaTV and Rumble filling the gap.\n\n  4. **Spanish-Language Content and Emerging Platforms:** Spanish content surged by 59% on Kick, making it the second most-watched language on the platform with 129 million hours. Meanwhile, new entrants like Chzzk and Rumble continue to offer alternatives, engaging unique audiences across diverse regions.\n\n  5. **Top Creators of Q3 2024:**\n\n    1. The top creators are losing their stranglehold on the market, with the top 5% of streamers by hours watched dropping from 98% of the total market share in Q2 2019 to just 86% in Q2 2024, indicating a more diverse market for smaller streamers.\n\n    2. Notable streamers such as KaiCenat and Ironmouse have set records this quarter. KaiCenat took the #1 spot with a 78% increase in viewership, while Ironmouse garnered 320,000 subscribers during \"Subtember,\" marking a new milestone.\n\n\n![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/e583956c-6f1b-4906-acb7-3c1846123928/945450/picture1.png)![](https://www.accesswire.com/imagelibrary/118b5d80-bda8-4c9c-8aeb-1c28dd3abd7a/945450/picture2222222222222222.png)\n\nFor more information on Stream Hatchet and insight into the esports and streaming markets, please visit their website at [www.streamhatchet.com](https://pr.report/4geu).\n\n**_About GameSquare Holdings, Inc._**\n\nGameSquare's (NASDAQ:GAME) mission is to revolutionize the way brands and game publishers connect with hard-to-reach Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and Millennial audiences.

On a sequential basis, I am encouraged by the 500 basis-point expansion in gross margin, the 11.1% reduction in operating expenses, and the $3.2 million improvement in Adjusted EBITDA.\"\n\n\"We also continue to pursue strategies aimed at strengthening our balance sheet and this morning we further solidified our balance sheet with a new $10 million convertible note with an entity controlled by Matt Kalish. This new capital, combined with over $11 million of cash on our balance sheet at September 30, 2024, provides us with increased flexibility to pay down our existing equity line facility with funds managed by Yorkville Advisors Global L.P. and take advantage of opportunities to accelerate revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.\"\n\n\"Positive momentum is growing across our business as more brands recognize the value of our next generation media platform.

As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable financial information presented in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, see the section entitled \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\" below.\n\nWe believe EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define \"EBITDA\" as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) income taxes; and (iii) interest expense.\n\n_Adjusted EBITDA_\n\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as EBITDA adjusted to exclude extraordinary items, non-recurring items and other non-cash items, including, but not limited to (i) share based compensation expense, (ii) transaction costs related to merger and acquisition activities, (iii) arbitration settlement reserves and other non-recurring legal settlement expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, primarily comprised of employee severance resulting from integration of acquired businesses, (v) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (vi) gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, (vii) change in fair value of assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis, (viii) gains and losses from discontinued operations, and (ix) net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest.\n\n_Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures_\n\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measure determined under US GAAP is set out below.\n\n**Three months ended September 30,**| **Nine months ended September 30,**  \n---|---  \n**2024**| **2023**| **2024**| **2023**  \nNet loss| $| (7,464,415| )| $| (5,051,699| )| $| (24,728,504| )| $| (13,481,156| )  \nInterest expense| 54,106| 209,237| 681,491| 354,561  \nIncome tax benefit| -| (11,469| )| -| (16,496| )  \nAmortization and depreciation| 803,687| 571,972| 2,513,882| 1,295,669  \nShare-based payments| 267,117| 405,907| 1,288,484| 1,288,292  \nTransaction costs| 1,287,223| 688,935| 3,417,687| 2,186,916  \nArbitration settlement reserve| (113,583| )| (212,234| )| (252,208| )| (951,878| )  \nRestructuring costs| 382,983| 92,334| 506,829| 386,620  \nLegal settlement| -| 3,381| -| 187,105  \nLoss on extinguishment of debt| 1,032,070| -| 1,032,070| -  \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration| -| -| (42,327| )| -  \nChange in fair value of warrant liability| (26,482| )| (133,216| )| (79,382| )| (1,844,094| )  \nChange in fair value of convertible debt carried at fair value| 98,937| (86,127| )| (357,822| )| (541,136| )  \nGain on disposition of subsidiary| -| -| (3,009,891| )| -  \nLoss on disposition of assets| -| -| 3,764,474| -  \nLoss from discontinued operations| 145| (423,303| )| 1,660,153| 2,347,244  \nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest| 1,979,943| -| 2,369,533| -  \nNet loss attributable to non-controlling interest (adjustment for NCI share of add backs to Adjusted EBITDA)| (467,632| )| -| (467,632| )| -  \nAdjusted EBITDA| $| (2,165,901| )| $| (3,946,282| )| $| (11,703,163| )| $| (8,788,353| )  \n  \n**SOURCE:** GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n\nView the original [press release](https://www.accesswire.com/942369/gamesquare-holdings-reports-record-2024-third-quarter-results) on [accesswire.com](http://accesswire.com)\n\n[View All News](https://investors.gamesquare.com/news/default.aspx)\n\n### Contact Us\n\n6775 COWBOYS WAY, STE. 1335FRISCO, TX, 75034\n\nir@gamesquare.com [216-464-6400](tel:216-464-6400)\n\n### Quick Links\n\n  * [SEDAR Filings](https://sedar.com)\n  * [Investor FAQs](https://investors.gamesquare.com/resources/investor-faqs/default.aspx)\n  * [Information Request Form](https://investors.gamesquare.com/resources/information-request-form/default.aspx)\n\n\n\n### Investor Email Alerts\n\nTo opt-in for investor email alerts, please enter your email address in the field below and select at least one alert option.

GameSquare intends to use the proceeds from the convertible note to pay down GameSquare's existing equity line facility with an investment fund managed by Yorkville Advisors Global L.P (\"Yorkville\"), and for general corporate purposes.\n\nJustin Kenna, CEO of GameSquare stated, \"Over the past 12 months, we have successfully pursued shareholder friendly transactions that raise non-dilutive capital and today's announcement reflects a continuation on this approach. Our ability to raise $10 million of capital at a $2.50 conversion price demonstrates the meaningful opportunities strategic investors see in the platform we have created. I am also pleased to announce that we intend to repay the existing equity line facility with Yorkville. With a strengthened balance sheet and capital position, we believe we have the financial resources in place to support the growth strategies we are pursuing and to take advantage of growing demand trends currently underway across our global markets.\"\n\nMatt Kalish of Gigamoon Media LLC stated, \"I continue to be impressed by the execution of Justin Kenna and the team at GameSquare, and the amazing revival of the FaZe Clan brand since the return of CEO FaZe Banks and team. The combination of GameSquare's creator platforms and operational expertise, as well as the masterful work of Banks and the FaZe team have the companies extremely well positioned for the future. I look forward to continuing my support of GameSquare, FaZe Banks, and the entire FaZe Clan team as they continue in their journey to create the world's largest and most powerful creator-led internet media company.\"\n\nIf Kalish elects to convert the Note into the remaining shares of FaZe Media it would value the entity at approximately $44 million, compared to GameSquare's current market cap of approximately $32 million. GameSquare still owns 100% of FaZe esports.\n\n**_About GameSquare Holdings, Inc._** GameSquare's (NASDAQ:GAME) mission is to revolutionize the way brands and game publishers connect with hard-to-reach Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and Millennial audiences.

As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar\nmeasures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable\nfinancial information presented in the Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP, see the section entitled\n“Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below.\nWe believe EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more meaningful\noperating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business performance\nand other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define “EBITDA” as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation and\namortization; (ii) income taxes; and (iii) interest expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure to assess the performance of the Company as it provides more\nmeaningful operating results by excluding the effects of expenses that are not reflective of our underlying business\nperformance and other one-time or non-recurring expenses. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA adjusted to\nexclude extraordinary items, non-recurring items and other non-cash items, including, but not limited to (i) share based\ncompensation expense, (ii) transaction costs related to merger and acquisition activities, (iii) arbitration settlement\nreserves and other non-recurring legal settlement expenses, (iv) restructuring costs, primarily comprised of employee\nseverance resulting from integration of acquired businesses, (v) impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, (vi)\ngains and losses on extinguishment of debt, (vii) change in fair value of assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value on\na quarterly basis, (viii) gains and losses from discontinued operations, and (ix) net income (loss) attributable to non-\ncontrolling interest.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nA reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measure determined under US GAAP is set\nout below.\nN\nA\net lo ssIn\nterest exp en seIn\nco m e tax b en efitA\nm o rtizatio n an d d ep reciatio nS\nh are-b ased p ay m en tsT\nran sactio n co stsA\nrb itratio n settlem en t reserv eR\nestru ctu rin g co stsL\neg al settlem en tL\no ss o n extin g u ish m en t o f d eb tC\nh an g e in fair v alu e o f co n tin g en t co n sid eratio nC\nh an g e in fair v alu e o f w arran t liab ilityC\nh an g e in fair v alu e o f co n v ertib le d eb t carried at fair v alu eG\nain o n d isp o sitio n o f su b sid iaryL\no ss o n d isp o sitio n o f assetsL\no ss fro m d isco n tin u ed o p eratio n sN\net lo ss attrib u tab le to n o n -co n tro llin g in terestN\net lo ss attrib u tab le to n o n -co n tro llin g in terest (ad ju stm en t foN\nC I sh are o f ad d b acks to A d ju sted E B IT D A )d\nju sted E B IT D A\nr\nT h ree m on th s en\n2 0 2 4\n$ (7,464,415)\n54,106\n-\n803,687\n267,117\n1,287,223\n(113,583)\n382,983\n-\n1,032,070\n-\n(26,482)\n98,937\n-\n-\n145\n1,979,943\n(467,632)$\n(2,165,901)\nded S eptem ber 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 3\n$ (5,051,699)\n209,237\n(11,469)\n571,972\n405,907\n688,935\n(212,234)\n92,334\n3,381\n-\n-\n(133,216)\n(86,127)\n-\n-\n(423,303)\n-\n-$\n(3,946,282)\nN in e m on th s en\n2 0 2 4\n$ (24,728,504)\n681,491\n-\n2,513,882\n1,288,484\n3,417,687\n(252,208)\n506,829\n-\n1,032,070\n(42,327)\n(79,382)\n(357,822)\n(3,009,891)\n3,764,474\n1,660,153\n2,369,533\n(467,632)$\n(11,703,163)\nded S eptem ber 3 0 ,\n2 0 2 3\n$ (13,481,156)\n354,561\n(16,496)\n1,295,669\n1,288,292\n2,186,916\n(951,878)\n386,620\n187,105\n-\n-\n(1,844,094)\n(541,136)\n-\n-\n2,347,244\n-\n-$\n(8,788,353)"

These include statements involving known and unknown risks,\nuncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed\nor implied in our forward-looking statements.\nFor information about forward-looking statements and risk factors, please see our 10-Q for the quarter\nended September 30, 2024, which will be available on the Company's website or with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission.\nI will now turn the call over to GameSquare's CEO, Justin Kenna. Justin, you may proceed.\nJustin Kenna:\nThank you, and good afternoon to everyone joining us on today's call.\nI'm pleased to announce GameSquare delivered strong third-quarter financial results that were in line\nwith our pre-announcement and reflect the strategies underway to drive organic sales growth, complete\nthe integration of our recent acquisitions, and build a profitable organization.\nOn a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10% year-over-year to a third-quarter record of $26.4 million.\nRevenue growth during the third quarter reflects the continued success of the growth strategies we are\npursuing and improving market dynamics compared to the same period last year.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n2\nI'm also encouraged by the significant improvements we are making to profitability with Adjusted\nEBITDA for the third quarter exceeding our initial expectations.\nOur quarterly Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.2 million for the 2024 third quarter compared to a loss\nof $5.4 million for the second quarter and a pro forma loss of $7.9 million for the first quarter. The\ncontinued sequential improvements in Adjusted EBITDA demonstrate the success of our ongoing\nefforts to grow revenue, increase gross margin, and reduce operating expenses.\nOur financial model is approaching an important inflection point and we expect our Adjusted EBITDA to\ncontinue to improve during the fourth quarter as we position GameSquare for profitability in 2025 and\nbeyond.\nAs we have stated on prior calls, our operating plan for 2024 has focused on three main components.\nFirst, to complete the integration of FaZe Clan acquisition and significantly reduce our cost structure.\nSecond, to strengthen our balance sheet and divest non-core assets. Third, to leverage our platform of\nowned and operated IP, agency and media, and SaaS technology assets to drive profitable growth. I\nbelieve our third quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making, executing against this plan.\nAs a reminder, in March 2024, we completed the acquisition of FaZe Clan in an all-stock transaction\nvalued at $14 million. FaZe Clan is comprised of two assets, FaZe esports, which is one of the world's\nbest and most recognized esports organizations, and FaZe Media, which we regard as the largest\nfollowed gaming brand in the world.\nAs part of our strategy for the FaZe Clan acquisition, we understood that in order for FaZe Media to be\nsuccessful, FaZe's founders and creators must be at the helm, have an ownership stake in the\norganization, and be empowered with creative direction.\nAs a result, we have completed three important transactions at FaZe Media to align GameSquare,\nFaZe's founders, and other key stakeholders around a plan to return the brand back to its roots and\nreboot FaZe Media for success in 2024 and beyond.\nFirst, in May, we formed FaZe Media as a separate standalone entity that combines the FaZe's creative\ntalent roster and non-esports assets into a creator-led IP and Internet media company under the\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n3\nleadership of CEO FaZe Banks, an original FaZe Clan founder. We simultaneously closed an $11\nmillion investment in FaZe Media from Matt Kalish, a founder of DraftKings, who now serves on the\nboard of FaZe Media.\nSecond, in June, we agreed to sell a 25.5% interest in FaZe Media to an entity controlled by FaZe\nMedia's CEO, FaZe Banks. Under the terms of the transaction, GameSquare retained voting control of\nthe transferred shares for a period of two years, during which FaZe Media will continue to be\nconsolidated into GameSquare's financial statements.\nFinally, today, we announced a new $10 million convertible note with GigaMoon Media, an entity\ncontrolled by Matt Kalish. Under the terms of the transaction, the conversion date is December 31,\n2025, at which time the note at GigaMoon's election will convert into either shares of GameSquare's\ncommon stock at a conversion price of $2.50 per share or 5.725 million shares of FaZe Media's Series\nA1 preferred stock beneficially held by GameSquare.\nIf GigaMoon elects to convert the note into the remaining shares of FaZe Media, it would value the\nentity at approximately $44 million compared to GameSquare's current market cap of approximately\n$32 million.\nWe believe this transaction is a huge win for GameSquare, for Kalish, and for FaZe Media. The\ntransaction aligns with our operating strategy by optimizing our business model and raising non-diluted\ncapital. It also deepens the alignment between GameSquare, Kalish, and other strategic investors while\nsupporting FaZe Banks' vision for the future of FaZe Media.\nWe'll use a portion of the new capital to pay down our existing Equity Live facility with funds managed\nby Yorkville, while increasing our cash position to take advantage of opportunities and accelerate\nrevenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.\nIn addition, we believe these transactions create the proper infrastructure for FaZe Media to be\nsuccessful, as FaZe Media now truly is a creator-led IP and media company supported by the\nleadership and expertise of Matt Kalish and full resources of GameSquare.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n4\nWhen we acquired FaZe Clan, the brand was suffering from significant losses, declining community\nengagement, and no clear strategic direction. I'm extremely proud of our efforts to turn around FaZe\nClan's performance and bring the brand back to life.\nThis is a direct result of the return and hard work of the founders under the leadership of CEO FaZe\nBanks, the strength of GameSquare's platform, our history with and knowledge of the brand, and most\nimportantly, our belief that if managed correctly, FaZe can re-engage with an extremely committed\ncommunity and lead to monetization opportunities in the coming months and quarters.\nI'd like to use this opportunity to thank everyone at GameSquare and FaZe for their hard work and\ndedication over the past three quarters.\nSince FaZe Media's reboot in April 2024, the re-engagement of the community has been fantastic. In\naddition to the statistics I shared on our last conference call, we recently announced the success of\nFaZe Clan's Subathon in September of '24.\nThe month-long Subathon was FaZe Clan's first major streaming event since the brand's reboot,\nshowcasing the successful return of FaZe Clan and its new creator roster. Some of the highlights\ninclude over 1.1 billion impressions, more than 760 million video views, and over 47 million\nengagements, setting new records at FaZe Clan's biggest event to date.\nThe event averaged 52.6 thousand concurrent viewers, peaked at 132.2 thousand, and garnered 2.2\nbillion minutes watched, with 257 million total views.\nFinally, FaZe Clan added over 300,000 new Twitch subscribers, as well as 350,000 total subscribers\nacross all participating channels. In fact, FaZe was the number one brand, by minutes watched, on\nTwitch during the month of September.\nDriving engagement with FaZe's community is an important indicator of future growth opportunities for\nGameSquare, as engagement helps support a robust pipeline of brand deals and future monetization\nopportunities. We continue to see a larger number of multiple seven-figure deals enter our pipeline,\nwhich are expected to convert to partnerships in 2024 and ‘25.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n5\nIn addition to GameSquare's ownership and voting control at FaZe Media, we continue to own 100% of\nFaZe esports. As one of the top esports' organizations in the world, we believe there is enormous\nopportunity to profitably grow FaZe esports. We're following a similar strategy that successfully grew\nour former esports team by over 220% in just two years.\nFor the third quarter, FaZe esports had revenue of $4.8 million and contributed positive Adjusted\nEBITDA.\nWe are also focused on driving efficiencies and reducing costs at FaZe Media and FaZe esports. When\ncomparing the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, we have removed approximately $17 million of\nannualized costs and believe there are opportunities to remove additional costs during the 2024 fourth\nquarter.\nWith a more efficient operating model and a more disciplined management structure, we believe there\nare a lot of opportunities to drive profitable growth at FaZe Media and FaZe esports, especially as each\nbusiness scales. Our third quarter Adjusted EBITDA demonstrates the continued improvements we are\nmaking and the benefits of our integration strategy.\nThe final component of our plan in 2024, I want to review today are the opportunities we are pursuing\nacross our owned and operated IP, agency and media and SaaS and technology assets to grow and\nimprove profitability.\nOverall, we are seeing trends continue to strengthen and through the first nine months of the year, we\nhave increased the number of customers on retainer. We've grown our average contract value by 46%,\nmore than tripled the number of UEFN World Building Campaigns deployed and achieved record\nmonthly contract wins in August of '24.\nHighlights during the third quarter for FaZe Media and esports include a multi-year, multi-million-dollar\nexpansion of role bid sponsorship deal, a new multi-year, multi-million-dollar sponsorship and licensing\ndeal with G Fuel, and FaZe esports' largest ever tournament winnings in the inaugural Esports World\nCup, which was held in Saudi Arabia during July and August.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n6\nWithin our media business, we announced multiple new projects during the quarter, including\ncampaigns for Topgolf, Dairy Max, 5-hour ENERGY, and a new and already growing relationship with\none of the big five entertainment studios.\nWe are also seeing favourable trends with—in our events business and we are kicking off our\npartnership with the NFL to launch a new travelling creative series called NFL 4 THE FANS LIVE. This\ninnovative series blends the excitement of NFL fandom on game day with interactive gaming and\ncreator-driven content accessible for in-person and online audience during the 2024 NFL season.\nFinally, in the rapidly evolving landscape of gaming and influencer marketing, we continue to evolve our\nstaff and technology offerings, focusing on the integration of data and insights with our creator\nmanagement and activation platform. This strategic approach is designed to provide game publishers\nand brands with a comprehensive solution set to effectively target audiences and optimise revenue\nperformance.\nEssential to this development is our influencer CRM tool, which has been refined to meet the specific\nneeds of our customers, allowing them to engage meaningfully with their most valued commercial\nchannel influencers. This capability will enhance our differentiated position in the influencer marketing\nspace.\nIn October, our streaming analytics and business intelligence platform launched an AI-powered\ninfluencer discovery tool designed to redefine how brands identify and connect with creators. This AI-\npowered solution marked a significant breakthrough in influencer marketing by using proprietary\nalgorithms to sift through data on over 15 million creators to find the most aligned partners for brand\ncampaigns.\nWe have launched this product with a customer that operates one of the largest online mobile games,\nand we have seen interest grow quickly from other game publishers as well as brands and creators.\nAs we look to the fourth quarter and beyond, we are excited by the direction we are headed, and\npositive momentum is growing across our business as more brands recognise the value of our next\ngeneration media platform.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n7\nOur interconnected media, creative and technology capabilities continue to provide brands with best-in-\nclass solutions to connect and engage with youth audiences at scale. We expect to end 2024 with\nrecord revenue, a record backlog of committed revenue, a higher number of customers on retainer, and\na growing pipeline.\nAs a result, we believe 2025 will be a strong year of growth and significantly improved profitability.\nWith this overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike to review our third quarter financial results. Mike?\nMichael Munoz:\nThanks, Justin.\nAs a reminder, 2024's financial results include multiple corporate actions, most significantly the March\n7, 2024, acquisition of FaZe Clan and the March 1, 2024, sale of Complexity Gaming, which has been\ntreated as a discontinued operation in our 2024 and 2023 year-to-date results.\nWe also further divested non-core assets during the year on May 31, 2024. As a result, we believe it is\nbest to look at our business on a pro forma basis, which includes a full year-to-date contribution of\nFaZe Clan.\nComparing our 2024 third quarter results to the prior year pro forma results, total revenue was $26.4\nmillion compared to $24.0 million. The 10% year-over-year increase in revenue was primarily due to\ngrowth from our agency and media business and owned and operated IP segment.\nGross margin for the 2024 third quarter was $5.2 million or 19.8% of sales compared to $3.4 million or\n14% of sales on a pro forma basis for the same period last year. We expect gross margin to improve\ngoing forward, supported by a more profitable revenue mix in the fourth quarter and additional actions\nunderway to improve gross margin.\nAs Justin mentioned, we have made significant strides in improving our operating cash burn figures\nover the last 12 months. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the 2024 third quarter amounted to $2.2 million\ncompared to a loss of $10.4 million on a pro forma basis last year.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n8\nAs a percentage of revenue, our Adjusted EBITDA loss improved from a negative 43.4% for the pro\nforma 2023 third quarter to a negative 8.2% for the 2024 third quarter.\nWhen comparing the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 results to FaZe Clan, the Company has removed\napproximately $17 million of annualized costs and expects to remove additional costs during the fourth\nquarter of 2024.\nWith this overview, I'll turn the call back over to Justin.\nJustin Kenna:\nThanks, Mike.\nBefore we open the call up to questions, I want to review our expectations for the remainder of the year.\nAfter a solid nine months, we believe we are extremely well positioned to achieve between $105 million\nand $110 million in annual revenue.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we ended the 2024 third quarter with a record backlog of committed revenue, a\nhigher number of customers on retainer and a growing pipeline, which we believe provides us with\ngood visibility into 2025. As a result, we believe 2025 will be a strong year of revenue growth and\nsignificantly improved profitability.\nAs we improve our cash burn and approach profitability, we have made additional strides to strengthen\nour balance sheet. At September 30, 2024, we had over $11 million in cash on our balance sheet and\nadded an additional $10 million of cash through today's announcement of the convertible note.\nAs a result, we have the flexibility to pay down our existing equity line facility and take advantage of\nopportunities to accelerate revenue growth in the fourth quarter and beyond. Twenty twenty-four is\nshaping up to be a transformative year for GameSquare, and we believe that we are well positioned to\nshow further sales growth and significantly improve profitability in 2025.\nWith this overview, Lou, Mike, and I are happy to take questions. Operator, please open up the call to\nquestions. Thank you.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n9\nOperator:\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To join the question queue, you may press star,\nthen one on your telephone keypad. You will hear a tone acknowledging your request. If you're using a\nspeakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question,\nplease press star and then two.\nOur first question comes from Jack Vander Aarde with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\nJack Vander Aarde:\nHey, that's pretty good. Hey, guys, congrats on the results. Great to see the strength. I have a couple—\nmaybe just a couple questions here. Can you speak a bit further into the record backlog you\nmentioned? Just what type of revenues does this include and just a sense of the margin profile as you\nguys make strides to increase that gross margin overall? Thanks.\nJustin Kenna:\nYes, absolutely. I can kick off there. Mike, Lou, feel free to add any colour. Jack, I think what's most\npleasing is a lot of the revenue growth that we're seeing, a lot of these longer-term, multi-year deals are\ncoming from growth in our agency business, which was a big contributor to that 46% average contract\nsize increasing and the higher retainer revenue. What is most pleasing about this, these multi-year\nseven-figure deals, to your point, Jack, around margin, is that they are higher in margin. I think that\nyou'll continue to see margin expand. Q2, there was a higher than expected programmatic revenue\nquarter and what we're starting to see, and I think you'll see more so into Q4 and specifically into 2025,\nis continued growth of our SaaS business, which is really high margin and growth of our agency\nbusiness, which again, we've really gone from, I think over the past two years, competing for the RFPs\ninto building long-term relationships. Now we're a lot more selective with who we're working with. We\nnamed some of the clients earlier in the call, but incredible clients that we're expanding our offerings\nwith and getting more strategic with and certainly expanding margins. We expect margins to expand. I'd\nsay that a lot of that growth is coming from that agency segment of the business.\nJack Vander Aarde:\nExcellent. That's helpful colour. I think it was in August, you guys put that press release out. That was\nvery encouraging about, I think there was $15 million or so of new revenue in sponsorship and licensing\ndeals, you guys, over multiple years, obviously. Just give us a sense, is this just the tip of the iceberg?\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n10\nHow does that compare to what you're expecting to bring in in terms of additional licensing and\nsponsorship deals as you guys continue on this path here of getting momentum? Just how does that\n$15 million or so that was acquired in the month of August, how does that compare to where you guys\nare heading, just to give us a sense? Thanks.\nJustin Kenna:\nYeah, we certainly believe that it is, Jack. I think what we're most pleased with and excited about,\ncertainly this year, as we talked about, it's been very transformative for us as a business. It's been a lot\nof heavy lifting on integrating FaZe Clan and pulling out costs. What I think has been the most pleasing\nis really the organic growth of the SaaS business and the agency business while we've been doing the\nFaZe cleanup. I think it really is—the floodgates are starting to open, to be really frank with you. I said\nthis last year, and it's really true in the fact that we went through a pretty tough time into the brand and\nad markets, and there were budgets shrinking, and I think, currently, we're seeing the opposite. I think a\nlot of the handholding we were doing, and I give our team a huge amount of credit for this, is these\nweren't lost clients. These were budgets that were shifting to later quarters, and we're starting to see\nthe benefit there.\nI think that the reality is that we talked about one of the biggest studios that we're partnered with, I think\nthe opportunity that we have to expand with our current customer base, rather than going out and\nfighting to try to win new work, is enormous. We're getting expanded budgets from these really large\nclients because we're executing, and that's really pleasing. That's one. I think another one is Epic\nGames. We continue to deliver for Epic. We're helping them activate a lot of their large cultural\nmoments. Super Bowl, TwitchCon, to name a few. We have an event this weekend in Vegas. We're\ndoing a lot of their live event work, a lot of their strategy work, working a lot more closely with their\nmobile team now. Yes, we expect a huge amount of organic growth in 2025. Pipeline's stronger than\never, but I think pipeline's easy to say. I think what's the most pleasing for us is we're executing, we're\nexpanding clients, and we're going to kick off 2025 with more locked in recurring revenue than ever\nbefore, so we're in good shape.\nJack Vander Aarde:\nOkay, fantastic to hear. I think that does it for me. Great work, guys. I appreciate it. I'll hop back in the\nqueue.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n11\nOperator:\nThe next question comes from Greg Gibas with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.\nGreg Gibas:\nHey, great. Good afternoon, Justin, Lou, and Mike. Thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on\nthe quarter. Really nice with the additional cost savings that you're seeing and reductions there. You\nmentioned seeing additional opportunity for cost reductions in Q4. Wondering if you could expand on\nthese opportunities and are you able to quantify them in any way?\nJustin Kenna:\nYes. I think, Greg, it's just continued efficiencies. I think a lot of the initial clean up of FaZe, there's still\nsome continued clean up. Obviously, when you come in and you integrate any asset, it takes a while.\nThere's some clearer maybe resource or contracts that you can eliminate sooner, but there's certainly\nrunoff and there's areas as you learn to integrate different systems and find greater efficiency. I think\nwe identified when we acquired FaZe, we publicly came out and said we can see around $18 million of\ncosts. You can see that we've achieved that on an annual basis, looking at the Q2 and Q3 numbers.\nThere's actually more and I think they're more so coming down to efficiencies rather than anything else.\nI think you'll see continued improvement. I think the reality is, Greg, that cost improvement is not going\nto be at the same rate as it was in Q2 or Q3. I won't give you an exact number, but I wouldn't expect\nthat to be at the same level of cost improvement, but we certainly think that there's some further cost\nefficiencies. What I would say is profitability comes from here for us, because I think that we've done\neverything we said we would do on the cost side. Profitability really comes from increased revenue and\nincreased margin. I think that if you look at again Q2 was higher than expected that's great, but a lot of\nthat additional revenue did come from the programmatic area, which is lower margin.\nWhat we're expecting in Q4 and certainly into 2025 is a lot of that growth in revenue is coming from our\nhigher margin areas of business. You will see improved costs. It won't be at the same rate as Q3. Q4,\nthere'll be some continued runoff of contracts and resources on the FaZe side, but I think a lot more on\ngetting efficient. I do think we're getting to a really healthy level of operating leverage. I think the reality\nis that we have the key pieces in place at the business. Like I talked about before, expanding these\ncurrent clients is not costing us the same level per dollar as it is to really create operating leverage and\ndrive additional revenue. We're seeing six figure and, in some cases, low seven figure deals translate\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n12\nto high seven figure deals. In some cases, some opportunities to even expand to eight figure deals. We\ndon't need to go and hire the same percentage of headcount to execute on those projects.\nGreg Gibas:\nGreat. That's helpful, Justin. Just regarding the record backlog and current pipeline, obviously great to\nsee. If I could follow up on the first question, I think you guys were asked those larger number of seven\nfigure deals that are entering the pipeline, what segments or categories are you seeing them in? It\nsounds like you mentioned strength in the agency business, but just wondering if you could provide any\nmore specifics on those new deals entering the pipeline. Thanks.\nJustin Kenna:\nYes, absolutely. I think it's a really healthy mix across the business, to be really frank. I think that on the\nFaZe side, the esports business, we have some really exciting opportunities. I think there'll be some\nreally positive news coming out of that world really soon. I think the FaZe media side we touched on the\nreality is that for part of this year, we blacked out our social channels, which have access to huge\naudience, and we signed new talent. There was a bit of a cooling off period. We've come back and I\nthink the Subathon in September just showed the true power of that brand. That's now resonating into\nwe signed G FUEL and DraftKings, and we've got a really large and active pipeline on that side as well.\nThe agency business certainly getting a lot more inbound. I think, again, I covered off on this a little bit,\nbut what, again, is really pleasing for us is the way that we are expanding budget with our existing\nclients. These clients are large, and I think there's opportunity to expand even further. I think, Greg, if\nyou have a look at even into segment one, the SaaS business is really healthy. We're getting to scale.\nWe're growing that as high margin, but we have within there nine of the top 10 game publishers as\nclients, currently we're providing agency event or content services for probably three of those nine. I\nthink there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to execute and cross sell and upsell within the group.\nThat's certainly something we'll be focused on in 2025. It is a really healthy mix across the group. Yes,\nwe would expect to be getting out some pretty positive news to market soon because—again, I know\nit's easy to talk to pipeline and obviously need to execute, but we're going to be kicking off 2025 in a\nreally good position.\nGreg Gibas:\nGreat. Appreciate the colour. I'll pass it on.\n© 2024 GameSquare Holdings, Inc.\n13\nOperator:\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Justin\nKenna for any closing remarks.\nJustin Kenna:\nYes. Thank you for that, and as always, thank you to everyone for joining and the continued support.\nIt really is greatly appreciated. I think it's certainly been a challenging year from a macro standpoint.\nAgain, I'm extremely pleased with the way we've been able to navigate that, the way our teams have\nbeen able to put their head down and really execute.\nI feel extremely bullish about the position that we're in closing out the year really strongly and entering\n2025, and a period of time that I really believe is a major inflection point for us as a business. That is\ngoing from ultra growth and cleanup mode to really generating cash. I think that that is going to be an\ninflection point for us. We look forward to getting the credit and the appreciation from the market as we\ncontinue to execute.\nThank you everyone for joining. We feel really bullish about where the Company's at and our path\nforward here is. Thanks again for the support and really looking forward to updating everyone on Q4 as\nwe continue to execute.\nThanks.\nOperator:\nThis brings to a close the GameSquare Holdings 2024 third quarter conference call.
