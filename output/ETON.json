Acquisition of U.S. Rights to Amglidia (Glyburide Oral Suspension)\n\n  * Amglidia® has been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is commercially available in Europe\n  * Strong strategic fit with Eton’s existing pediatric endocrinology focus\n  * Amglidia has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n  * Potential New Drug Application (NDA) submission in 2026\n\n\n\nDEER PARK, Ill., Nov. 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Eton” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ETON), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today announced that it has acquired the U.S. rights to Amglidia (glyburide oral suspension, known as glibenclamide in Europe) for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus from AMMTeK.\n\n“This exciting transaction adds another attractive, patented product candidate to our growing pediatric endocrinology portfolio. In addition, the product aligns with Eton’s expertise and wealth of experience in bringing to market liquid and precision dose formulations for pediatric patients,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals.\n\n“Currently, there are no FDA-approved oral treatments for neonatal diabetes mellitus. Amglidia has been used successfully to treat European patients for years, and families and pediatric endocrinologists have expressed to us the significant need for this treatment in the United States. We look forward to working with AMMTeK to bring the product to U.S. patients as quickly as possible,” concluded Brynjelsen.\n\nAmglidia is a proprietary, patented liquid product that was developed for the treatment of neonatal diabetes mellitus by AMMTeK, a French biotechnology company. The product was approved by the EMA in 2018. The product has already been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. FDA. Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare condition estimated to impact approximately 300 patients in the United States. Currently, there are no FDA-approved oral treatment options and as a result, U.S. patients frequently either rely on compounded products that are not FDA-approved or administer products off-label by making homemade suspensions.\n\nAMMTeK has conducted a post-approval study tracking five years of real-world safety and efficacy in European patients, which will be used to support Eton’s NDA submission. Eton plans to hold a meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2025 and anticipates submitting an NDA for the product in 2026.\n\n**About Eton Pharmaceuticals**\n\nEton is an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases. The Company currently has five commercial rare disease products: ALKINDI SPRINKLE®, PKU GOLIKE®, Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, and Nitisinone. The Company has three additional product candidates in late-stage development: ET-400, ET-600, and ZENEO® hydrocortisone autoinjector.

call today at 4:30pm ET\n\n\n\nDEER PARK, Ill., Nov. 12, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Eton” or “the Company”) (Nasdaq: ETON), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.\n\n“Our strong product revenue growth in the third quarter allowed us to achieve positive GAAP net income from product revenue for the first time in the Company’s history and we’re pleased to reach this important milestone one quarter ahead of our original goal. We are proud of our ability to continue delivering exceptional growth, as demonstrated by our 15th straight quarter of sequential growth in product revenue, while managing the bottom line,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals.\n\n“This milestone is just the beginning of Eton’s growth story. With the upcoming close of the Increlex acquisition and our ET-400 PDUFA date approaching, 2025 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Eton. We are very excited about what we can achieve in the coming quarters and years,” concluded Brynjelsen.\n\n**Third Quarter and Recent Business Highlights**\n\n**Delivered 15****th****straight quarter of sequential growth in product sales and reported positive GAAP net income.** Eton reported third quarter 2024 product sales of $9.8 million, representing 40% growth over the prior year period, and 8% over the second quarter of 2024, driven primarily by the ongoing growth of ALKINDI SPRINKLE® and Carglumic Acid. During the quarter, Eton produced positive GAAP net income for the first time in Company history from product revenue alone.\n\n**Entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire Increlex® (mecasermin injection) from Ipsen S.A.** The transaction, which was announced in October, will add a high-value biologic product to the Company’s commercial portfolio. The product is synergistic with Eton’s existing pediatric endocrinology call point, and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to 2025 earnings. The Company anticipates the transaction closing near year-end 2024.\n\n**New Drug Application (NDA) for ET-400 accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).** In July, the FDA accepted Eton’s NDA for ET-400, its proprietary patented formulation of hydrocortisone oral solution and assigned the application a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of February 28, 2025. Eton expects to manufacture product inventory in the fourth quarter of 2024 to enable a commercial launch promptly after the expected approval in 2025. The Company believes the introduction of ET-400 will enable it to capture a greater percentage of the oral hydrocortisone market and, together with ALKINDI SPRINKLE, the two products are expected to achieve combined peak sales of more than $50 million annually.\n\n**Granted additional patent for ET-400.** On November 5, Eton was granted an additional patent for ET-400 by the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), further strengthening the IP protection for the product. The patent, which expires in 2043, covers hydrocortisone oral liquid formulations and is expected to be listed in the FDA’s Orange Book upon ET-400’s approval.\n\n**Strong growth of ALKINDI SPRINKLE and the Company’s metabolic portfolio.** ALKINDI SPRINKLE reported 55% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 2024**.** Carglumic Acid also reported another quarter of strong sequential and year-over-year growth. The commercial availability of Betaine Anhydrous, Nitisinone, and PKU GOLIKE® has helped increase the frequency of the Company’s interactions with potential Carglumic Acid prescribers.\n\n**Initiation of ET-600 pivotal study.** ET-600’s pivotal bioequivalence study has been initiated. ET-600 is under development for the treatment of the pediatric endocrinology condition diabetes insipidus. If the study results are positive, Eton anticipates submitting an NDA for the product in the first quarter of 2025.\n\n**Third Quarter Financial Results**\n\n**Net Revenue:** Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were $10.3 million compared to $7.0 million in the prior year period. Net sales in the current year period included $0.5 million of licensing payments received from out-licensing of the company’s DS-200 product.\n\nProduct sales and royalty revenue were $9.8 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 40% compared to $7.0 million in the prior year period, and an increase of 8% over the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase in product sales revenue was primarily driven by growth in ALKINDI SPRINKLE and Carglumic Acid.\n\n**Gross Profit** : Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.3 million compared to $4.4 million in the prior year period.\n\n**Research and Development (R &D) Expenses**: R&D expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.5 million compared to $0.6 million in the prior year period as a result of decreased expenses associated with ET-400 project development activities.\n\n**General and Administrative (G &A) Expenses:** G&A expenses for the third quarter of 2024 were $5.3 million compared to $4.3 million in the prior year period, mainly due to increased sales and marketing activities, legal expenses, and employee-related expenses.\n\n**Net Income:** Net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $0.6 million or $0.02 per basic and diluted share. In the prior year period, net loss was $0.6 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share.\n\n**Cash Position** : As of September 30, 2024, Eton had cash and cash equivalents of $20.3 million. The Company generated $2.9 million of operating cash flow during the quarter. The Company expects to generate positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and to fund its acquisition of Increlex with cash on hand and an expansion of its existing credit facility.\n\n**Conference Call and Webcast Information**\n\nAs previously announced, Eton Pharmaceuticals will host a its third quarter 2024 conference call as follows:\n\nDate  | November 12, 2024  \n---|---  \nTime  | 4:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. CT)  \nDial in | Toll-free: 888-596-4144  \nNon-toll free: 646-968-2525  \nAccess Code: 1144771  \nWebcast: | [Click Here](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/5mjrvgna)  \n  \nIn addition to taking live questions from participants on the conference call, management will be answering emailed questions from investors.

Patent for ET-400 (Hydrocortisone Oral Solution)\n\n- Product has patent protection through 2043 -- Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of February 28, 2025 -\n\nDEER PARK, Ill., Nov. 07, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc (“Eton” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: ETON), an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases, today announced that the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has granted the Company U.S. Patent Application No. 18/443,889, now U.S. Patent No. 12,133,914, for ET-400, a proprietary patented formulation of liquid hydrocortisone. The patent, which expires in 2043, covers a method of using hydrocortisone oral liquid formulations and is expected to be listed in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Orange Book upon the product’s approval. Eton received its first patent (US 11,904,046) for ET-400 in February 2024 and the Company has an additional U.S. patent application under review related to the product.\n\n“We are pleased to have been granted a second patent for ET-400, further strengthening the IP protection of this important asset. Through our interactions with the patient community, we’ve seen firsthand the extensive need and desire for an FDA-approved liquid formulation of hydrocortisone,” said Sean Brynjelsen, CEO of Eton Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe FDA has accepted the Company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for ET-400 and has assigned the application a PDUFA target action date of February 28, 2025. If approved, ET-400 would be the only FDA-approved liquid formulation of hydrocortisone.\n\n**About Eton Pharmaceuticals**\n\nEton is an innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing treatments for rare diseases. The Company currently has five commercial rare disease products: ALKINDI SPRINKLE®, PKU GOLIKE®, Carglumic Acid, Betaine Anhydrous, and Nitisinone. The Company has three additional product candidates in late-stage development: ET-400, ET-600, and ZENEO® hydrocortisone autoinjector.

These and other risks concerning Eton’s development programs and financial position are described in additional detail in Eton’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
